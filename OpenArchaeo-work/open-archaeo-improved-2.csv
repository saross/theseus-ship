By transforming raw 3D data into interpretable outputs, JSDNE actively supports research requiring precise, data-driven insights. This package provides a convenient workflow within the R environment, including tools for data import, cleaning, and model estimation, thereby enabling researchers to systematically assess ageing processes and interpret demographic profiles from osteological collections.",https://github.com/jisunjang19/cran-JSDNE,,,,,,,,https://cran.r-project.org/package=JSDNE,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2024.106080,,jisunjang19,,,,,,Packages and libraries,R,Artefact morphology,archhist-software-tool,,,,,
eratosthenes,"Eratosthenes is an open-source R package that provides a robust computational framework for constructing and refining archaeological chronologies. By integrating multiple datasets, including historical records, radiocarbon dates, and stratigraphic information, it employs advanced algorithms to reconcile uncertainties and produce coherent timelines. Researchers can systematically model temporal relationships, visualize chronological overlaps, and explore the impact of various assumptions on dating accuracy. The resulting reconstructions are invaluable for interpreting historical developments, testing hypotheses, and comparing datasets across sites or periods. This dynamic approach to chronology-building supports rigorous, reproducible research in archaeology and related disciplines.",https://github.com/scollinselliott/eratosthenes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,scollinselliott,,,,,,Packages and libraries,R,Chronological modelling,archhist-software-tool,,,,
lakhesis,"Lakhesis is an R package that helps researchers explore and select seriation solutions for binary data matrices, particularly valuable in fields like archaeology where relative dating is essential. It provides a flexible, interactive environment that allows users to apply different methods, evaluate partial orders, and form consensus-based sequences. By highlighting key measures, Lakhesis ensures that users can gauge the reliability and confidence of resulting orderings. Researchers can thus generate meaningful insights into temporal or structural patterns, supporting data-driven investigations and fostering a deeper understanding of the underlying phenomena.",https://github.com/scollinselliott/lakhesis,,,,,,,,https://cran.r-project.org/package=lakhesis,,,,,,scollinselliott,,,,,,Packages and libraries,R,Statistical analysis,archhist-software-tool,,,,,
ArchaeoMag,"ArchaeoMag is a specialized software tool designed to facilitate the modeling and analysis of magnetic anomalies within archaeological research contexts. By enabling archaeologists and researchers to integrate geophysical survey data with advanced simulation algorithms, it helps reconstruct subsurface landscapes, identify potential features, and interpret magnetometry results more accurately. Developed by Dr. Antonio Schettino, this open-source program harnesses robust computational techniques to visualize and model magnetic fields across distinct archaeological contexts, thereby contributing to more informed excavation strategies and improved understanding of underground structures. The flexible architecture and user-friendly interface make ArchaeoMag a valuable tool for multidisciplinary research teams.",https://github.com/antonio-schettino/ArchaeoMag,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.4430/bgta0296,,antonio-schettino,,,,,,Standalone software,,Geophysical survey,archhist-software-tool,,,,,
MoDuLAAR,"MoDuLAAR is a comprehensive toolkit that provides advanced capabilities for modeling and analyzing amino acid racemization processes, particularly useful in archaeological and paleontological dating studies. By integrating data processing, dehydration analysis, racemization simulation, parameter optimization, and result visualization, this framework empowers researchers to explore kinetic behaviors and time-dependent transformations in amino acids. Designed for reliability and flexibility, MoDuLAAR harnesses robust computational techniques to generate reproducible insights, thereby supporting the accurate reconstruction of chronological information from ancient biomolecular samples.",https://github.com/Palaeoprot/ModulAAR,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.palaeome.org/get-involved/software/modulaar,,,Palaeoprot,,,,,,Packages and libraries,Python,Palaeoproteomics,archhist-software-tool,,,,,
