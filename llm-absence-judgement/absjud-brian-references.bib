This scale captures cognitive, affective, behavioral, and motivational components of the construct that have been identified by various philosophers in their conceptual analyses of intellectual humility. We find that intellectual humility has four core dimensions: Open-mindedness (versus Arrogance), Intellectual Modesty (versus Vanity), Corrigibility (versus Fragility), and Engagement (versus Boredom). These dimensions display adequate self-informant agreement, and adequate convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity. In particular, Open-mindedness adds predictive power beyond the Big Six for an objective behavioral measure of intellectual humility, and Intellectual Modesty is uniquely related to Narcissism. We find that a similar factor structure emerges in Germanophone participants, giving initial evidence for the model’s cross-cultural generalizability.},

This article looks more closely at the scholarship that has made this re-evaluation possible. The practical dimension of scholastic medicine — as evident in the resolution of conflicts between Galen and Aristotle as in discussions of specific drugs — has been fully revealed in this newer historiography. It discusses medicine as essentially a verbal and gestural performance that aims to leave patients ‘satisfied’ and the answer to these questions comes from the theoretical writings that are the main material deposit of all the rhetoric and from adopting the patient's perspective. The principal achievements thus far of the historiography of medieval medicine have been to assess many of the main texts on their own terms, avoiding reference to biomedicine, and giving the texts first an intellectual context and then, more recently, a social one.},

	title = {The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity},
	abstract = {Recent generations of frontier language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models ({LRMs}) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces’ structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of compositional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how {LRMs} “think”. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier {LRMs} face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing {LRMs} with their standard {LLM} counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) lowcomplexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform {LRMs}, (2) medium-complexity tasks where additional thinking in {LRMs} demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models experience complete collapse. We found that {LRMs} have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.},

In addition, it should focus not only on a project as a collection of tangible and intangible assets, but also on the potential user base for these assets and what these users consider valuable about them.,The conclusions of the paper have been formulated in the context of one specific project. As such, it may amplify the specificities of this project in its results.,An approach to project sustainability following the recommendations outlined in this paper would include a number of uncommon features, such as a longer development horizon, wider perspective on project results, and an audit of tacit and explicit knowledge.,These results can ultimately preserve public investment in projects.,This paper supplements more reductive models for project sustainability with a more holistic approach that others may learn from in mapping and sustaining user value for their projects for the medium to long terms.},

Given their capabilities, many intellectual laborers naturally question to what extent these {AI} models will be able to usurp their own jobs. As behavioral scientists, we performed an effort to examine the extent to which an {AI} can perform our roles. To achieve this, we utilized commercially available {AIs} (e.g., {ChatGPT} 4) to perform each step of the research process, culminating in an {AI}-written manuscript. We attempted to intervene as little as possible in the {AI}-led idea generation, empirical testing, analysis and reporting. This allowed us to assess the limits of {AIs} in a behavioral research context and propose guidelines for behavioral researchers wanting to utilize {AI}. We found that the {AIs} were adept at some parts of the process and wholly inadequate at others. Our overall recommendation is that behavioral researchers use {AIs} judiciously, and carefully monitor the outputs for quality and coherence. We additionally draw implications for editorial teams, doctoral student training, and the broader research ecosystem.},

Our findings reveal that {AI} significantly enhances performance: individuals with {AI} matched the performance of teams without {AI}, demonstrating that {AI} can effectively replicate certain benefits of human collaboration. Moreover, {AI} breaks down functional silos. Without {AI}, R\&D professionals tended to suggest more technical solutions, while Commercial professionals leaned towards commerciallyoriented proposals. Professionals using {AI} produced balanced solutions, regardless of their professional background. Finally, {AI}’s language-based interface prompted more positive selfreported emotional responses among participants, suggesting it can fulfill part of the social and motivational role traditionally offered by human teammates. Our results suggest that {AI} adoption at scale in knowledge work reshapes not only performance but also how expertise and social connectivity manifest within teams, compelling organizations to rethink the very structure of collaborative work.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the potential educational uses of chat-based large language models ({LLMs}), moving past initial hype and skepticism. Although {LLM} outputs often evoke fascination and resemble human writing, they are unpredictable and must be used with discernment. Several metaphors—like calculators, cars, and drunk tutors—highlight distinct models for student interactions with {LLMs}, which we explore in the paper. We suggest that {LLMs} hold a potential in students’ learning by fostering proleptic reasoning through scaffolding, i.e., presenting a technological accompaniment in anticipating and responding to potential objections to arguments. Here, the technical limitations of {LLMs} can be reframed as beneficial when fostering anticipatory reasoning. Whether their outputs are accurate or not, evaluating them stimulates learning. {LLMs} require students to critically engage, emphasizing analytical thinking over mere memorization. This interaction helps solidify knowledge. Additionally, we explore how engaging with {LLMs} can prepare students for constructive collective discussions and provide first steps in addressing epistemic injustices by highlighting potential research blind spots. Thus, while acknowledging the sociopolitical and ethical complexities of using {LLMs} in education, we suggest that when used in an informed way, they can promote critical thinking through anticipatory reasoning.},

	abstract = {Background
The National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research ({ITCR}) program provides a series of funding mechanisms to create an ecosystem of open-source software ({OSS}) that serves the needs of cancer research. As the {ITCR} ecosystem substantially grows, it faces the challenge of the long-term sustainability of the software being developed by {ITCR} grantees. To address this challenge, the {ITCR} sustainability and industry partnership working group ({SIP}-{WG}) was convened in 2019.

Objective
The charter of the {SIP}-{WG} is to investigate options to enhance the long-term sustainability of the {OSS} being developed by {ITCR}, in part by developing a collection of business model archetypes that can serve as sustainability plans for {ITCR} {OSS} development initiatives. The working group assembled models from the {ITCR} program, from other studies, and from the engagement of its extensive network of relationships with other organizations (eg, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Open Source Initiative, and Software Sustainability Institute) in support of this objective.

This paper reviews the existing sustainability models and describes 10 {OSS} use cases disseminated by the {SIP}-{WG} and others, including 3D Slicer, Bioconductor, Cytoscape, Globus, i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) and {tranSMART}, Insight Toolkit, Linux, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics tools, R, and {REDCap} (Research Electronic Data Capture), in 10 sustainability aspects: governance, documentation, code quality, support, ecosystem collaboration, security, legal, finance, marketing, and dependency hygiene.

Results
Information available to the public reveals that all 10 {OSS} have effective governance, comprehensive documentation, high code quality, reliable dependency hygiene, strong user and developer support, and active marketing. These {OSS} include a variety of licensing models (eg, general public license version 2, general public license version 3, Berkeley Software Distribution, and Apache 3) and financial models (eg, federal research funding, industry and membership support, and commercial support). However, detailed information on ecosystem collaboration and security is not publicly provided by most {OSS}.

Conclusions
We recommend 6 essential attributes for research software: alignment with unmet scientific needs, a dedicated development team, a vibrant user community, a feasible licensing model, a sustainable financial model, and effective product management. We also stress important actions to be considered in future {ITCR} activities that involve the discussion of the sustainability and licensing models for {ITCR} {OSS}, the establishment of a central library, the allocation of consulting resources to code quality control, ecosystem collaboration, security, and dependency hygiene.},

	abstract = {Computational reproducibility (i.e. issues of reproducibility stemming from the computer as a scientific tool) possesses its own dynamics and narratives of crisis. Alongside the difficulties of computing as an ubiquitous yet complex scientific activity, computational reproducibility suffers from a naive expectancy of total reproducibility and a moral imperative to embrace the principles of free software as a non-negotiable epistemic virtue. We argue that the epistemic issues at stake in actual practices of computational reproducibility are best unveiled by focusing on software as a pivotal concept, one that is surprisingly often overlooked in accounts of reproducibility issues. Software is not only about designing and coding but also about maintaining, supporting, distributing, licensing, and governance; it is not only about developers but also about users. We focus on openness debates among computational chemists involved in molecular modeling software packages as empirical grounding for our argument. We then identify and analyse four epistemic characteristics (transparency, consistency, sustainability and inclusivity) as key to the role of software in computational reproducibility. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Supporting sustainability in software engineering is becoming an active area of research. We want to contribute the first Systematic Literature Review({SLR}) in this field to aid researchers who are motivated to contribute to that topic by providing a body of knowledge as starting point, because we know from own experience, this search can be tedious and time consuming. Aim: We aim to provide an overview of different aspects of sustainability in software engineering research with regard to research activity, investigated topics, identified limitations, proposed approaches, used methods, available studies, and considered domains. Method: The applied method is a {SLR} in five reliable and commonly-used databases according to the (quasi-standard) protocol by Kitchenham et al. [1]. We assessed the 100 first results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classified publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unfitting usage of terms within the search query. Conclusions: Currently, there is little research coverage on the different aspects of sustainability in software engineering while other disciplines are already more active. Future work includes extending the study by reviewing a higher number of publications, including dedicated journal and workshop searches, and snowballing.},

	abstract = {Challenges related to development, deployment, and maintenance of reusable software for science are becoming a growing concern. Many scientists' research increasingly depends on the quality and availability of software upon which their works are built. To highlight some of these issues and share experiences, the First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences ({WSSSPE}1) was held in November 2013 in conjunction with the {SC}13 Conference. The workshop featured keynote presentations and a large number (54) of solicited extended abstracts that were grouped into three themes and presented via panels. A set of collaborative notes of the presentations and discussion was taken during the workshop. Unique perspectives were captured about issues such as comprehensive documentation, development and deployment practices, software licenses and career paths for developers. Attribution systems that account for evidence of software contribution and impact were also discussed. These include mechanisms such as Digital Object Identifiers, publication of "software papers", and the use of online systems, for example source code repositories like {GitHub}. This paper summarizes the issues and shared experiences that were discussed, including cross-cutting issues and use cases. It joins a nascent literature seeking to understand what drives software work in science, and how it is impacted by the reward systems of science. These incentives can determine the extent to which developers are motivated to build software for the long-term, for the use of others, and whether to work collaboratively or separately. It also explores community building, leadership, and dynamics in relation to successful scientific software.},

	abstract = {Context:
Modern societies are highly dependent on complex, large-scale, software-intensive systems that increasingly operate within an environment of continuous availability, which are challenging to maintain, and evolve in response to changes in stakeholder requirements of the system. Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability – the capacity to endure in changing environments – is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice.
Objective:
The objective of the paper is to re-examine our previous assumptions and arguments in light of advances in the field. This reflection paper provides an opportunity to obtain new insights into the trends in software sustainability in both academia and industry, from a software architecture perspective specifically and software engineering more broadly. Given advances in research in the field, the increasing introduction of academic courses on different sustainability topics, and the engagement of companies to cope with sustainability goals, we reflect on advances and maturity about the role sustainability in general plays in today’s society. More specifically, we revisit the trends, open issues and research challenges identified five years ago in our previous paper on software sustainability research and practice from a software architecture viewpoint, which aimed to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures in order to consider how this paper influenced and motivated research in the intervening years.
Method:
The forward snowballing method was used to establish the methodological basis for our reflection on the state of the art. A total of 234 studies were identified between April 2018 and June 2023 and 102 studies were found to be relevant according to the selection criteria. A further subset was mapped to the primary themes of the original paper including definitions and concepts, reference architectures, measures and metrics, and education.
Vision:
The vision of this reflection paper is to provide a new foundation and road map of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software engineering highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.},

Modern societies are highly dependent on complex, large-scale, software-intensive systems that increasingly operate within an environment of continuous availability, which is challenging to maintain and evolve in response to the inevitable changes in stakeholder goals and requirements of the system. Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability – the capacity to endure in changing environments – is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice.
Problem
Accidental software complexity accrues both naturally and gradually over time as part of the overall software design and development process. From a software architecture perspective, this allows several issues to overlap including, but not limited to: the accumulation of technical debt design decisions of individual components and systems leading to coupling and cohesion issues; the application of tacit architectural knowledge resulting in unsystematic and undocumented design decisions; architectural knowledge vaporisation of design choices and the continued ability of the organization to understand the architecture of its systems; sustainability debt and the broader cumulative effects of flawed architectural design choices over time resulting in code smells, architectural brittleness, erosion, and drift, which ultimately lead to decay and software death. Sustainable software architectures are required to evolve over the entire lifecycle of the system from initial design inception to end-of-life to achieve efficient and effective maintenance and evolutionary change.
Method
This article outlines general principles and perspectives on sustainability with regards to software systems to provide a context and terminology for framing the discourse on software architectures and sustainability. Focusing on the capacity of software architectures and architectural design choices to endure over time, it highlights some of the recent research trends and approaches with regards to explicitly addressing sustainability in the context of software architectures.
Contribution
The principal aim of this article is to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.},

The paper provides an insight on the project life-span for a free open source software ecosystem.

Previous research suggest that future software maintainability can be predicted, based on various source code aspects, but most of the research focuses on the prediction based on the present state of the code and ignores its history. While taking the history into account in software maintainability prediction seems intuitive, the research empirically testing this has not been done, and is the main goal of this paper. This paper empirically evaluates the contribution of historical measurements of the Chidamber \& Kemerer (C\&K) software metrics to software maintainability prediction models. The main contribution of the paper is the building of the prediction models with classification and regression trees and random forest learners in iterations by adding historical measurement data extracted from previous releases gradually. The maintainability prediction models were built based on software metric measurements obtained from real-world open-source software projects. The analysis of the results show that an additional amount of historical metric measurements contributes to the maintainability prediction. Additionally, the study evaluates the contribution of individual C\&K software metrics on the performance of maintainability prediction models.},

	abstract = {Research software has become a central asset in academic research. It optimizes existing and enables new research methods, implements and embeds research knowledge, and constitutes an essential research product in itself. Research software must be sustainable in order to understand, replicate, reproduce, and build upon existing research or conduct new research effectively. In other words, software must be available, discoverable, usable, and adaptable to new needs, both now and in the future. Research software therefore requires an environment that supports sustainability.,  Hence, a change is needed in the way research software development and maintenance are currently motivated, incentivized, funded, structurally and infrastructurally supported, and legally treated. Failing to do so will threaten the quality and validity of research. In this paper, we identify challenges for research software sustainability in Germany and beyond, in terms of motivation, selection, research software engineering personnel, funding, infrastructure, and legal aspects. Besides researchers, we specifically address political and academic decision-makers to increase awareness of the importance and needs of sustainable research software practices. In particular, we recommend strategies and measures to create an environment for sustainable research software, with the ultimate goal to ensure that software-driven research is valid, reproducible and sustainable, and that software is recognized as a first class citizen in research. This paper is the outcome of two workshops run in Germany in 2019, at {deRSE}19 - the first International Conference of Research Software Engineers in Germany - and a dedicated {DFG}-supported follow-up workshop in Berlin.},

Now that the Digital Humanities ({DH}) are becoming a well-established research field, producing seminal publications in print as well as digital formats, the time for consolidation has come. It is noteworthy that digital tools and methods from the pioneering days of the {DH} are degrading and some have already vanished. Therefore, it is urgent to take action and to prevent further losses. While the necessity of high quality research data management ({RDM}) is encouraged or even required by funding agencies and there is an increasing awareness for long-term archiving ({LTA}), when it comes to primary research data, the fact that the {DH} exhibit a structural deficit regarding maintaining and preserving research software is at the least underestimated.

In this panel, we will focus on infrastructure and institutional support. Beginning with an overview of existing strategies from the {DH} and beyond, we highlight selected strategies to compare how they are implemented at different institutions in terms of infrastructure, expert knowledge and also funding. We also want to evaluate the extent of institutional support that is needed to successfully sustain and archive {DH} projects and the software they use. We will discuss currently implemented solutions to maintain and preserve research projects and software, all of which approach the outlined problem from a different angle.},

            Diving below the surface has its challenges, however. For example, “noise effects” are especially widespread when digital images have been created from earlier microphotographic copies, as is common in historical newspaper collections. Noise effects introduce interference to the primary signals of the pages, both for human vision and computer vision and processing. Various types of noise effects (fig. 1) are common, including unevenly distributed luminosity (i.e., range effects), visible characters from the other side of the page (bleed-through), tilted document scans (skewed orientation), and markings on the newspaper that obscure text (blobs).1 There is a wide range of severity for each of these effects, and images can range from very clean to very noisy within and across datasets.},

	abstract = {The Software Sustainability Institute ({SSI}) was the first organisation in the world dedicated to improving software in research. It was founded in 2010 on the premise that helping individuals and institutions to understand the vital role that software plays in research would accelerate progress in every field of scientific and academic endeavour. The {SSI} set itself the ambitious goal of transforming academic culture by establishing the principle that reliable, reproducible, and reusable software is necessary across all research disciplines.

	abstract = {Purpose
              This paper proposes a new perspective on the enormous and unresolved challenge to existing practices of publication and documentation posed by the outputs of digital research projects in the humanities, where much good work is being lost due to resource or technical challenges.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The paper documents and analyses both the existing literature on promoting sustainability for the outputs of digital humanities projects and the innovative approach of a single large-scale project.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings of the research presented show that sustainability planning for large-scale research projects needs to consider data and technology but also community, communications and process knowledge simultaneously. In addition, it should focus not only on a project as a collection of tangible and intangible assets, but also on the potential user base for these assets and what these users consider valuable about them.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The conclusions of the paper have been formulated in the context of one specific project. As such, it may amplify the specificities of this project in its results.
            
            
              Practical implications
              An approach to project sustainability following the recommendations outlined in this paper would include a number of uncommon features, such as a longer development horizon, wider perspective on project results, and an audit of tacit and explicit knowledge.
            
            
              Social Implications
              These results can ultimately preserve public investment in projects.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper supplements more reductive models for project sustainability with a more holistic approach that others may learn from in mapping and sustaining user value for their projects for the medium to long terms.},

	abstract = {This essay will explore the role of soft and hard funding in the digital humanities, with particular attention paid to the ways funding intersects with sustainability. It will discuss a variety of types of soft funding available from public, private, and institutional sources, and the ways the needs of funders can align with or compete with the desires of scholars. The availability and sustainability of funding as project needs change over time, along with funders' agendas, can influence project teams' decisions about the direction a project will take, who leads it, who can contribute to it, what technology supports it, on what servers it is hosted, if and when it can be updated, as well as if and where it will be preserved. Not considering the implications of financial support received can be detrimental to both the project and the researchers involved. Seeking funding should become part of wider strategies that enable the formation of mutually beneficial relationships, promising avenues of research, and sustainable revenue streams, rather than a time sink that explodes a project's scope in ways that undermine the project.},

            Concepts of sustainability touch every aspect of scholarly work and are particularly urgent in thinking about those practices that depend on digital technology. The costs of digital scholarship are frequently posed in terms of human labor and rights abuses, ecological and environmental damage, carbon footprints, waste of resources associated with obsolescence, and other issues that affect every stage of the lifecycle of production. But sustainability also needs to be understood as an epistemic concept embedded in complex systems, not merely as a set of problems to be solved through instrumental means applied to operational logistics. This article addresses mechanistic approaches to sustainability, while suggesting that the complexity of the concept of sustainability requires the humanistic methods and ethical principles to be engaged in decisions about future practices in pedagogy, research, and institutional sites.},

I was quite surprised at how different the conversations were compared to those on the same topic that I had heard at Software Sustainability Institute and {RSE} events; while reference was often made to the importance of documentation, the use of automated testing and version control were rarely mentioned. One presenter did have unit testing on their todo list and the {RSE} teams involved in the sustainability panel did say they use testing as part of the software lifecycle but did not consider it part of preservation. I think that this is because the object being sustained is different in digital humanities projects: the destination matters more than the journey.},

Our outcomes are an evaluation of the process and output using qualitative methods, publicly accessible and described project components on two Virginia Tech projects, and a potential workflow that can be applied to future work. By breaking down individual projects into their respective components of content, code, metadata, and documentation and examining each component individually for access and preservation, we can begin migrating our digital scholarship to a sustainable, portable, and accessible existence.},

            Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research, yet significant challenges to discoverability, productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability exist. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source, and {FAIR} (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities and research software is now being understood as a type of digital object to which {FAIR} should be applied. This emergence reflects a maturation of the research community to better understand the crucial role of {FAIR} research software in maximising research value. The {FAIR} for Research Software ({FAIR}4RS) Working Group has adapted the {FAIR} Guiding Principles to create the {FAIR} Principles for Research Software ({FAIR}4RS Principles).

Over the course of this project, we have come to realise that open-source approaches have applications in archaeological research beyond the development of software itself. The development of redeployable eld recording systems, which must be exible and robust in order to accommodate the diversity of archaeological data, represent one such application. {FAIMS} project software facilitates this type of development by separating the (large and complicated) application code from the (relatively simple and largely human-readable) document les that customise the application for use by a particular project. Distributed version control systems like {GitHub}, which are already being used for texts and documents beyond code, provide a capable platform for coordinating peer production of these deenition documents. {FAIMS} has used {GitHub} successfully for its internal development of early-adopter eld projects over the last year, demonstrating its potential. Just as open-source approaches have improved software by bringing the insights of an entire community to bear on diicult problems, eld recording systems-as well as the methods and approaches they embody also beneet from the transparency provided by wide distribution and collaboration facilitated by version control systems.},

	abstract = {Archaeology has an issue with “just-in-time” research, where insufficient attention is paid to articulating a research design before fieldwork begins. Data collection, management, and analysis approaches are under-planned and, often, evolved during fieldwork. While reducing the amount of preparation time for busy researchers, these tendencies reduce the reliability of research by exacerbating the effects of cognitive biases and perverse professional incentives. They cost time later through the accrual of technical debt. Worse, these practices hinder research transparency and scalability by undermining the quality, consistency, and compatibility of data. Archaeologists would benefit from embracing the “preregistration revolution” sweeping other disciplines. By publicly commiting to research design and methodology ahead of time, researchers can produce more robust research, generate useful and reusable datasets, and reduce the time spent correcting problems with data. Preregistration can accommodate the diversity of archaeological research, including quantitative and qualitative approaches, hypothesis-testing and hypothesis-generating research paradigms, and place-specific and generalising aims. It is appropriate regardless of the technical approach to data collection and analysis. More broadly, it encourages a more considered, thoughtful approach to research design. Preregistration templates for the social sciences can be adopted for use by archaeologists.},

Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.},

The fact that evaluation is not being properly performed on Internet information means both that questionable information is being used recklessly, without adequately assessing its authority, and good information is being disregarded, because trust in the information is lacking. Both scenarios may be resolved by ascribing proper amounts of cognitive authority to Internet information. Traditional measures of authority present in a print environment are lacking on the Internet, and, even when occasionally present, are of questionable veracity. A formal model and evaluative criteria are herein suggested and explained to provide a means for accurately ascribing cognitive authority in a networked environment; the model is unique in its representation of overt and covert affiliations as a mechanism for ascribing proper authority to Internet information.},

A mixed-method approach was employed, integrating qualitative analysis using Morley’s (2014) Academic Phrasebank and quantitative data to identify patterns in rhetorical strategies, offering a comprehensive view of writing practices across academic levels. The findings reveal a significant difference in the rhetorical devices used, with Scopus-indexed articles featuring a more complex range of patterns which doctoral students less frequently utilize. These findings underscore the necessity for enhanced academic writing instruction that equips doctoral students with rhetorical strategies. This research provides key insights for academic writing pedagogy, advocating for the integration of targeted approaches such as advanced writing workshops, structured peer review, and the use of rhetorical analysis frameworks to foster the development of writing sophistication and meet publication standards.

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) are fundamentally different from search engines, functioning more as 'vibe-machines' than information retrieval systems. However, conveying appropriate expectations and usage modes for these novel interfaces remains challenging. This paper critically examines Willison's 'calculator for words' analogy and Bucci's counter-arguments, analysing the strengths and limitations of this metaphor.

While we argue that the 'calculator for words' analogy serves as an effective negative heuristic -- discouraging users from treating generative {AI} prompts as search engine queries -- it falls short in providing positive intuition for effective {LLM} utilisation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel conceptual framework: 'maps of no territory.'

Drawing inspiration from Borges' 'On Exactitude in Science,' our 'maps of no territory' analogy aims to provide more nuanced intuitions for general audiences, guiding them towards effective use while steering them away from problematic applications. This metaphor offers a more comprehensive understanding of {LLMs}' nature, capabilities, and limitations, potentially fostering more informed and responsible engagement with these powerful {AI} systems.},

This essay focuses primarily on the medical genealogy of the concept of observation. In ancient Greek culture, an elaboration of the concept of observation (tērēsis) first emerged in the Hellenistic age with the medical sect of the Empirics, to be further developed by the ancient Sceptics. Basically unknown in the Middle Ages, the Empirics’ conceptualisation of tērēsis trickled back into Western medicine in the fourteenth century, but its meaning seems to have been fully recovered by European scholars only in the 1560s, concomitantly with the first Latin translation of the works of Sextus Empiricus. As a category originally associated with medical Scepticism, observatio was a new entry in early modern philosophy. Although the term gained wide currency in general scholarly usage in the seventeenth century, its assimilation into standard philosophical language was very slow. In fact, observatio does not even appear as an entry in the philosophical dictionaries until the eighteenth century—with one significant exception, the medical lexica, which featured the lemma, reporting its ancient Empiric definition, as early as 1564.},

Agentic {LLMs} are {LLMs} that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic {LLMs} and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic {LLMs} may provide a solution for the problem of {LLMs} running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that {LLMs} can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with {LLM} assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic {LLMs} are also likely to benefit society.},

As their applications expand into multi-agent environments, there arises a need for a comprehensive evaluation framework that captures {LLMs}' reasoning, planning, collaboration, and other social abilities. This work introduces a novel competition-based benchmark framework specifically designed to assess {LLMs} within multi-agent settings, providing quantitative metrics to evaluate their judgment, reasoning, deception, self-awareness, cooperation, coordination, and rationality.We utilize two social deduction games alongside three game-theory scenarios to create diverse environments.Our frame is fortified with the probabilistic graphic modeling ({PGM}) method, enhancing the {LLMs}' capabilities in navigating complex social and cognitive dimensions. We evaluate seven {LLMs}, quantitatively highlighting a significant capability gap of over threefold between the strongest, {GPT} o1, and the weakest, Llama-2-70B. It also confirms that our {PGM} enhancement boosts the abilities of all selected models by an average of 37\%. Our data and code can be found here https://github.com/cathyxl/{MAgIC}.},

	abstract = {The ability to achieve oneʼs goals is a defining characteristic of intelligent behaviour. A great many existing theories, systems and research programmes address the problems associated with generating behaviour to achieve a goal; much fewer address the related problems of how and why goals should be generated in an intelligent artifact, and how a subset of all possible goals are selected as the focus of behaviour. It is research into these problems of motivation, which this article aims to stimulate. Building from the analysis of a scenario involving a futuristic household robot, we extend an existing account of motivation in intelligent systems to provide a framework for surveying relevant literature in {AI} and robotics. This framework guides us to look at the problems of encoding drives (how the needs of the system are represented), goal generation (how particular instances of goals are generated from the drives with reference to the current state), and goal selection (how the system determines which goal instances to act on). After surveying a variety of existing approaches in these terms, we build on the results of the survey to sketch a design for a new motive management framework which goes beyond the current state of the art.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been considerable interest in large language models: machine learning systems which produce human-like text and dialogue. Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “{AI} hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing {AI} misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.},

	abstract = {Intellectual humility is increasingly recognized as a cognitive virtue that helps foster truth-seeking and compromise, and mitigating polarization. Yet the current body of evidence grapples with a striking contradiction: The prevailing theoretical account suggests that intellectual humility hinges on metacognitive ability—the capacity to introspect on one's own performance which manifests in assigning due confidence to the varying accuracy of one's performance. However, empirical research testing this metacognitive ability account of intellectual humility has yielded inconsistent results. Here, we introduce a cognitive science approach informed by Signal Detection Theory, allowing for a more nuanced separation of metacognitive ability from correlated but distinct concepts (i.e., confidence and task performance). We conduct a national survey study among a national {US} sample (N = 999) involving the interpretation of one of the most heavily contested domains—climate change—lending itself for an investigation into how intellectual humility relates to cognitive processes in domains where it is most needed. To gauge participants' ability to distinguish true from false interpretations of evidence (i.e., task performance), we presented them with four summaries of fictitious studies on renewable energy, followed by 2-alternative forced choice questions that assessed their accuracy and confidence in their responses. Results showed that firstly, more intellectually humble citizens performed better at discerning correct from incorrect interpretations of the presented evidence. Secondly, more intellectually humble citizens exhibited a heightened capacity to adjust their confidence levels to the varying accuracy of their evidence interpretations–indicating higher metacognitive ability—and this association was robust to accounting for their superior task performance, and other preregistered covariates. And thirdly, in contrast to intuitive notions, more intellectually humble citizens did not exhibit lower metacognitive bias, the inclination to report lower (vs. higher) confidence in general. By highlighting the role of metacognitive ability in intellectual humility, the current study delivers empirical evidence for the ancient notion that epistemic virtues may involve metacognitive ability.},

I argue in Sections 2 and 3 that inevitabilist stances are doubly guilty of epistemic hubris—a lack of epistemic humility—and that the real question concerns the scope and strength of our contingentism. The latter stages of the paper—Sections 4 and 5—address some epistemological and historiographical worries and sketch some examples of deep contingencies to guide further debate. I conclude by affirming that the concept of epistemic humility can usefully inform critical reflection on the contingency of the sciences and the practice of history of science.
•I offer an epistemological analysis of the two broad stances on the question of whether the results of scientific enquiry are inevitable or contingent.•‘Inevitabilist’ stances implicitly rely upon exaggerated estimations of our epistemic capacities.•Inevitabilism collapses into a form of contingentism.•The ‘put up or shut up objection’ is also rejected.•The concepts of epistemic humility and epistemic hubris can play a useful role in debates about the historical contingency of science.},

Rooted in extant theories of agency, this account enables fine-grained, nuanced comparative characterizations of artificial agency. I show that this account has multiple important virtues and is more informative than alternatives. More speculatively, it may help to illuminate two important emerging questions in {AI} ethics: 1. Can agency contribute to the moral status of non-human beings, and how? 2. When and why might {AI} systems exhibit power-seeking behaviour and does this pose an existential risk to humanity?},

While such systems have substantial potential to help people more eﬃciently and eﬀectively achieve their own goals, they also create risks of harm. In this white paper, we suggest a deﬁnition of agentic {AI} systems and the parties in the agentic {AI} system life-cycle, and highlight the importance of agreeing on a set of baseline responsibilities and safety best practices for each of these parties. As our primary contribution, we oﬀer an initial set of practices for keeping agents’ operations safe and accountable, which we hope can serve as building blocks in the development of agreed baseline best practices. We enumerate the questions and uncertainties around operationalizing each of these practices that must be addressed before such practices can be codiﬁed. We then highlight categories of indirect impacts from the wide-scale adoption of agentic {AI} systems, which are likely to necessitate additional governance frameworks.},

	abstract = {The employment of technology and digitization is crucial for cultural organizations to establish and sustain digital repositories for their cultural heritage artifacts. This exploitation is also essential in facilitating the presentation of cultural works and exhibits to a broader audience. Consequently, in this work, we propose a custom-developed digital repository that functions as software-as-a-service ({SaaS}), primarily promoting the safe storage, display, and sharing of cultural materials; enhancing accessibility; and fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of cultural heritage. The proposed digital repository service is designed as a multitenant architecture, which enables organizations to expand their reach, enhance accessibility, foster collaboration, and ensure the preservation of their content. Moreover, our technology stack incorporates robust and reliable backend technologies, such as Django, to ensure data security and efficient management. Meanwhile, the frontend is powered by Angular, which guarantees a user-friendly and engaging interface for exploring and interacting with cultural materials. Specifically, this project aims to assist each cultural institution in organizing its digital cultural assets into collections and feeding other digital platforms, including educational, museum, pedagogical, and games, through appropriate interfaces. The creation of this digital repository offers a cutting-edge and effective open-access laboratory solution. It allows organizations to have a significant influence on their audiences by fostering cultural understanding and appreciation. Additionally, it facilitates the connection between different digital repositories and national/European aggregators, promoting collaboration and information sharing. By embracing this innovative solution, cultural institutions can benefit from shared resources and features, such as system updates, backup and recovery services, and data analytics tools, attributes that are currently provided by the platform.},

	abstract = {Today, with the advent of Large-scale generative Language Models ({LLMs}) it is now possible to simulate free responses to interview questions such as those traditionally analyzed using qualitative research methods. Qualitative methodology encompasses a broad family of techniques involving manual analysis of open-ended interviews or conversations conducted freely in natural language. Here we consider whether artificial “silicon participants” generated by {LLMs} may be productively studied using qualitative analysis methods in such a way as to generate insights that could generalize to real human populations. The key concept in our analysis is algorithmic fidelity, a validity concept capturing the degree to which {LLM}-generated outputs mirror human sub-populations’ beliefs and attitudes. By definition, high algorithmic fidelity suggests that latent beliefs elicited from {LLMs} may generalize to real humans, whereas low algorithmic fidelity renders such research invalid. Here we used an {LLM} to generate interviews with “silicon participants” matching specific demographic characteristics one-for-one with a set of human participants. Using framework-based qualitative analysis, we showed the key themes obtained from both human and silicon participants were strikingly similar. However, when we analyzed the structure and tone of the interviews we found even more striking differences. We also found evidence of a hyper-accuracy distortion. We conclude that the {LLM} we tested ({GPT}-3.5) does not have sufficient algorithmic fidelity to expect in silico research on it to generalize to real human populations. However, rapid advances in artificial intelligence raise the possibility that algorithmic fidelity may improve in the future. Thus we stress the need to establish epistemic norms now around how to assess the validity of {LLM}-based qualitative research, especially concerning the need to ensure the representation of heterogeneous lived experiences.},

	shorttitle = {Editorial},
	abstract = {In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, Artificial Intelligence ({AI}), and specifically Large Language Models ({LLMs}), are redefining how organizations operate, make decisions, and engage with customers. {AI}-driven technologies have become indispensable, providing businesses with powerful tools to streamline operations, derive actionable insights from vast data, and foster more meaningful customer interactions. For business leaders, scholars, and practitioners alike, understanding the transformative potential of {AI} isn’t just advantageous—it’s essential to staying competitive in an increasingly data-driven world.This editorial delves into recent scholarly advancements in {LLM} applications within business contexts, analyzing studies that explore {AI}’s potential across various domains, from decision support to creative industries. By introducing a structured framework, this editorial highlights key insights and contributions from recent studies, assessing their value to academia and industry. The following comparative analysis sheds light on how these innovations shape our understanding of {AI}’s role in business while pointing to future research directions.Puyt and Madsen\&\#39;s (2024) study stands out as a foundational exploration of {LLM} accuracy, assessing {ChatGPT}-4\&\#39;s ability to recount the history of the {SWOT} analysis-a vital business strategy tool. Their findings reveal that, while {ChatGPT}-4 effectively conveys general concepts, it struggles with detailed historical information, often producing inaccuracies or \&quot;hallucinations.\&quot; This gap underscores the need for {LLMs} to be trained with verified academic data, particularly for strategic business applications that demand precision. This study not only contributes to the literature by proposing methods to evaluate {AI} accuracy in historical contexts but also highlights the importance of rigorous information vetting in industry settings where reliability is crucial.In contrast, Raikov et al. (2024) explore a hybrid intelligence model that combines {LLM} capabilities with explainable {AI} ({XAI}) principles to enhance human-machine collaboration. Their approach emphasizes cognitive semantics, improving transparency and decision-making efficiency. The hybrid model\&\#39;s real-time adaptability addresses the needs of complex, regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, where trust in {AI} decisions is paramount. Academically, this study provides a valuable addition to {XAI} literature by demonstrating how {LLMs} can bridge the gap between {AI} autonomy and human oversight, making it a model for future human-{AI} interactions in complex business environments.Another significant study by Mariotti and colleagues (2024) examines the integration of {LLMs} with enterprise knowledge graphs to enhance data-driven decision-making. By enabling organizations to leverage knowledge graphs for more accurate and scalable data retrieval, this research provides a robust framework for businesses seeking efficient knowledge management systems. The academic contribution here lies in advancing the dialogue between {LLMs} and knowledge graphs, emphasizing ethical data handling and quality standards essential for industry applications. For enterprises, the study offers practical solutions to achieve streamlined data management, balancing automation with privacy and security. 2024) take a different approach, investigating {LLMs}\&\#39; role in creative industries, specifically within fashion design. They introduce a hybrid intelligence model that supports creative processes, allowing {AI} to complement rather than replace human ingenuity. While {LLMs} in this field demonstrate potential in automating repetitive design tasks and enhancing customer personalization, the study reveals limitations in {AI}\&\#39;s ability to handle spatial and stylistic nuances. This study\&\#39;s academic contribution lies in promoting human-{AI} co-creation, inspiring further research into {AI} applications across diverse creative sectors, including media and marketing.Collectively, these studies not only illuminate {LLMs}\&\#39; transformative potential in business but also highlight critical ethical and operational considerations. Ensuring accuracy, transparency, and data privacy are vital to responsibly integrating {AI} into business workflows. Future research should focus on enhancing {LLM} accuracy, refining hybrid intelligence models, and exploring creative {AI} applications, all while maintaining ethical standards. As {LLMs} evolve, interdisciplinary collaborations will be essential to harness their full potential, making {AI} an ethical, effective, and innovative force in the business world.},

It goes beyond the traditional logical paradigms of explainable artificial intelligence ({XAI}) by considering poor-formalizable cognitive semantical interpretations of {LLM}. {XAI} is immersed in a hybrid space, where humans and machines have crucial distinctions during the digitisation of the interaction process. The author’s convergent methodology ensures the conditions for making {XAI} purposeful and sustainable. This methodology is based on the inverse problem-solving method, cognitive modeling, genetic algorithm, neural network, causal loop dynamics, and eigenform realization. It has been shown that decision-makers need to create unique structural conditions for information processes, using {LLM} to accelerate the convergence of collective problem solving. The implementations have been carried out during the collective strategic planning in situational centers. The study is helpful for the advancement of explainable {LLM} in many branches of economy, science and technology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The {API} is prompted using a Python script with a series of structured questions from an Excel file and the results are recorded in another Excel file and rated on a binary scale. Our findings present a nuanced view of {ChatGPT}-4’s capabilities. We observe that while {ChatGPT}-4 demonstrates a high level of proficiency in describing and outlining the general concept of {SWOT} analysis, there are notable discrepancies when it comes to detailing its origins and evolution. These inaccuracies range from minor factual errors to more serious hallucinations that deviate from evidence in scholarly publications. However, we also find that {ChatGPT}-4 comes up with spontaneous historically accurate facts. Our interpretation of the result is that {ChatGPT} is largely trained on easily available websites and to a very limited extent has been trained on scholarly publications on {SWOT} analysis, especially when these are behind a paywall. We conclude with four propositions for future research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
