For each occurence of a tool in the sources searched. I think this is fine as-is.

Tool name

AI Notes explaining the nature of the reference
-I would also like to classify each reference as something that indicates 'live' software versus a historical citation.

(from this dataset, we should be able to generate a timeline for each tool)


For each tool in the dataset
    * Tool name
    * Version control repository link (GitHub, GitLabs, etc.)
    * Repository link (CRAN, zenodo, etc)
    * Official website link
    * Other links
    * Earliest evidence
    * Latest evidence of life
    * Final citation (some tools are referenced as 'inspiring' other tools or are dicussed in lit reviews, but are not 'still alive')
    * Detailed description of tool
    * Classificaiton: script (stand-alone python, R, etc. scripts), package / libraries / extensions (published package or extension of either a language like python or R, or software like ArcGIS / QGIS), software (stand-alone software)
    * Some indication of size / complexity, at least for stand-along software (?)
    * Commercial or OS? and/or Licence
    * Tool for what stage of the research / data lifecycle (conceptualisation, data capture / collection, active data management / sharing / cleaning / transformation / improvement, data analysis, data archiving / publication / deposit)
    * Interoperability with other tools (yes / no, if yes then which?)
