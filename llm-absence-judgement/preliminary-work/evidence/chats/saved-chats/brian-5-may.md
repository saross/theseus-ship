Annotated Bibliography: Fostering Student Agency in AI Education for Politics/IR via Transformative Learning and the Rumsfeld Matrix

1. Introduction: The Challenge of AI in Politics/IR Education

UNESCO. (2023). Guidance for generative AI in education and research. <https://doi.org/10.54675/EWZM9535>
This official guidance document outlines the disruptive potential of AI (specifically GenAI) in education, urging policy-makers to develop frameworks addressing risks and leveraging opportunities, supporting the need for pedagogical shifts.

"As GenAI tools are increasingly able to automate some basic levels of writing and artwork creation, they are forcing education policy-makers and institutions to revisit why, what and how we learn. These are now critical considerations for education in this new phase of the digital era."

Gonzalez, A., & Hall, L. (2024). Transforming Higher Education: The Impact of Emerging Technologies on Global Learning Landscapes. ERIC Number: EJ1456040 <https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1456040.pdf>
This article critiques traditional educational models, arguing they are insufficient for preparing students for a future shaped by emerging technologies like AI, VR, and AR, necessitating pedagogical innovation.

"The influence of emerging technologies extends beyond pedagogical methods to affect curriculum design, assessment methods, and the operational aspects of educational institutions. The digital transformation in education demands reevaluating traditional educational models and adopting innovative strategies that leverage technological advancements to enhance educational experiences."

These concerns highlight the need for a balanced approach in the integration of emerging technologies, considering their benefits, but also potential limitations and challenges."

1. Theoretical Framework: Transformative Learning and Locus of Control
2.1 Transformative Learning Theory (TLT)

Mezirow, J. (1997). Transformative Learning: Theory to Practice. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education, 1997(74), 5–12. <https://doi.org/10.1002/ace.7401>
This foundational article explains Mezirow's theory, detailing how adults transform their frames of reference through critical reflection on disorienting experiences, relevant for understanding how students adapt to AI.

"Transformative learning refers to the process by which we transform our taken-for-granted frames of reference (meaning perspectives, habits of mind, mind-sets) to make them more inclusive, discriminating, open, emotionally capable of change, and reflective so that they may generate beliefs and opinions that will prove more true or justified to guide action."

This study applies TLT to interdisciplinary learning, identifying how complex problems (like those involving technology) can create 'disorienting dilemmas' related to identity, problem-solving, and collaboration, triggering potential transformation.

"Students' interdisciplinary problem-based learning experiences, especially those that challenge their existing beliefs and assumptions, can be studied through a 'disorienting dilemma' from Mezirow's (1991) transformative learning theory. A disorienting dilemma is an experience which does not fit with one's existing belief system."

2.2 Locus of Control (LOC) and Student Agency
Rotter, J. B. (1966). Generalized expectancies for internal versus external control of reinforcement. Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 80(1), 1–28. <https://doi.org/10.1037/h0092976>
This seminal paper introduces the concept of Locus of Control, differentiating between internal (belief in personal control) and external (belief in outside forces), forming the basis for the AI-LOC concept.

"When people interpret the consequences of their behavior to be controlled by luck, fate, or powerful others, this indicates a belief in what Rotter called an external locus of control... Conversely, he maintained that if people interpret their own behavior and personality characteristics as responsible for behavioral consequences, they have a belief in an internal locus of control."

"As research exploring student agency in higher education increases, recognition is growing that integration of agency-supportive practices and learning environments is essential for the cultivation of agentic students in higher education."

1. Pedagogical Tools: The Rumsfeld Matrix and Structured Risk-Taking
3.1 The Rumsfeld Matrix: Embracing Uncertainty

Rumsfeld, D. H. (2002, February 12). DoD News Briefing - Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen. Myers. U.S. Department of Defense.(<https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/204646/dod-news-briefing-secretary-rumsfeld-and-gen-myers/>)
This official transcript provides the original articulation of the "known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns" framework, useful for structuring discussions about epistemological awareness regarding AI.

"...as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know."

Creely, E., Henriksen, D., & Henderson, M. (2021). Risk and uncertainty: Understanding the role of failure in supporting learner creativity. Thinking Skills and Creativity, 42, 100939. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2021.100939>
This article discusses how traditional schooling often discourages risk and views failure negatively, contrasting with the need for risk-taking in creative development and suggesting pedagogical approaches like 'productive failure' that embrace uncertainty.

"Despite the prevalence of risk-taking in creative development, risk is often viewed negatively in schooling. Policy settings tuned to standardization and metrics promote narrow norms and one-correct-answer approaches... School environments, driven by policy and assessment framings, often approach failure punitively."

3.2 Structuring Risk-Taking and Psychological Safety
