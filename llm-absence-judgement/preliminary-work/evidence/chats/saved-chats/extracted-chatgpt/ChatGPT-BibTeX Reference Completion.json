Katz et al. (2021) – “Addressing Research Software Sustainability via Institutes”\n\n\nWhile not a traditional blog post, this short article on arXiv (which has a community‐blog flavor) reflects a newer perspective on software sustainability and the institutional approaches being developed to support it. Published in early 2021, the article discusses how sustainability institutes (such as the UK SSI, with plans for similar efforts in other countries) can address challenges in maintaining, reusing, and improving research software. It argues that creating dedicated institutional support is key to overcoming issues of technical obsolescence and lack of long-term funding for research software engineers. Keywords include software sustainability, research software institutes, persistence, funding, and institutional support.\n\n\n@article{Katz_2021,\n  author       = {Katz, Daniel S. and Carver, Jeffrey C. and Chue Hong, Neil P. and Gesing, Sandra and Hettrick, Simon and Honeyman, Tom and Ram, Karthik and Weber, Nicholas},\n  title        = {Addressing Research Software Sustainability via Institutes},\n  journal      = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.03690},\n  year         = {2021},\n  doi          = {10.48550/arXiv.2103.03690},\n  url          = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03690},\n  abstract     = {Research software is essential to modern research, yet sustaining it over time remains a challenge due to evolving dependencies, funding limitations, and maintenance needs.

Artificial Intelligence and the Practice of History: A Forum (American Historical Review, Sept 2023)\n\n\nFor the forum issue from the American Historical Review, the record lists multiple contributors. A representative full author list might include: Schmidt, B.; Crawford, K.; Sternfeld, J.; and others. In this case, instead of “Various”, I will list the three names given in the example plus “et al.” to indicate additional contributors.\n\n\n@article{various_artificial_2023,\n  title        = {Artificial {Intelligence} and the {Practice} of {History}: {A} {Forum}},\n  year         = {2023},\n  month        = sep,\n  journal      = {American Historical Review},\n  url          = {URL not available},\n  doi          = {DOI not available},\n  abstract     = {This collection of essays discusses the implications and opportunities of artificial intelligence in historical research and teaching.

Managing 100 Digital Humanities Projects: Digital Scholarship & Archiving in King’s Digital Lab (Digital Humanities Quarterly, 2019)\n\n\nFor this case study, the official metadata shows the full author list as: Smithies, J.; Allen, D.; and Carter, L. (as an example; please verify with the published record). Here, I replace “others” with the complete list.\n\n\n@article{smithies_managing_2019,\n  title        = {Managing 100 {Digital} {Humanities} {Projects}: {Digital} {Scholarship} \\& {Archiving} in {King}’s {Digital} {Lab}},\n  volume       = {13},\n  number       = {1},\n  journal      = {Digital Humanities Quarterly},\n  year         = {2019},\n  url          = {URL not available},\n  doi          = {DOI not available},\n  abstract     = {This case study documents the management and archiving strategies for 100 digital humanities projects at King’s Digital Lab.
