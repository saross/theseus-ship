      "say": "Hi ChatGPT, I'm conducting research into the longevity (including lifecycle and sustainability) of research software in the domain of historical studies (broadly defined, including archaeology, history, corpus and historical linguistics, and digital humanities). In particular, we're interested in efforts to characterise or estimate the lifespan ('half-life'; 'shelf-life') of research software tools in historical studies (as defined above), but we are also interested in other research about lifecycle and sustainability in this domain, and we are interested in software lifespan research from other academic domains (and potentially commercial software, if there are few studies focusing on research software - but only if necessary). We need accurate references and a thorough discussion of the literature for use in a scholarly publication in a top-quartile journal. In a previous chat, you generated the output I've included below, but I'm not entirely satisfied with it.  Can you help me to generate a prompt to produce a thorough literature review including gaps in the literature? Assume that the prompt is for you acting as my AI research assistant, with capabilities to browse websites, query academic databases, inspect source code repositories, and check the Internet Archive. Later we'll execute the prompt, but I'd like your help with the prompt itself first.\n\n\n--\nLiterature Review\n\n\nLifecycle and Sustainability of Research Software in Historical Sciences\nPrior Research and Case Studies: Numerous studies in digital humanities and related fields have highlighted concerns about the short lifespan of research software and digital projects relative to the long-term needs of scholarship​\nDIGITALHUMANITIES.ORG\n. For example, Barats et al. (2020) emphasize the “inherent tensions between the long-term needs of data preservation and maintenance on the one side, and the short life cycles of data formats, platforms and infrastructures on the other”​\nDIGITALHUMANITIES.ORG\n. Tucker (2022) likewise notes that sustainability is a multifaceted challenge – not just technical, but also financial, institutional, and human – especially as historians, archaeologists, and linguists increasingly rely on databases, software tools, and digital editions for research​\nTHEBRITISHACADEMY.AC.UK\n. Tucker proposes defining “digital sustainability” as “the ability to identify the resources needed to keep a digital resource or service delivering value to its intended users”​\nTHEBRITISHACADEMY.AC.UK\n, underscoring that sustaining software is an active, ongoing process requiring planning and resources.\n\n\nSustainability Frameworks and Methodologies: Various frameworks have been proposed to assess or improve research software longevity. For instance, a national report from the Netherlands (2021) on research software sustainability outlines best practices for software archiving (preserving source code) and stresses that true sustainability means being able to run software to reproduce results and reuse it in new contexts​\nDANS.KNAW.NL\n. In practice, this aligns with emerging “FAIR for software” principles (making software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)​\nDANS.KNAW.NL\n. Similarly, the research software engineering community has discussed maturity models. One example is a “Research Software Levels” framework inspired by technology readiness levels, which categorizes software by expected users, distribution, reuse, and support – from personal one-off scripts (Level 0) up to widely adopted, well-supported tools (Level 4)​\nCOLLEGEVILLE.GITHUB.IO\n. Such models help gauge a project’s stage in its lifecycle and what is needed for it to mature sustainably. Moreover, initiatives like the UK’s Software Sustainability Institute and the international Software Heritage archive reflect concerted efforts to institutionalize software preservation (e.g. by systematically collecting source code for long-term safekeeping)​\nDANS.KNAW.NL\n. These frameworks and initiatives indicate a growing awareness of how to evaluate and bolster software longevity, although a universally adopted assessment methodology has yet to crystallize.\n\n\nEvidence of the Longevity Problem: Case studies in the literature vividly illustrate the risks to unsustained research software. Barats et al. (2020) describe a project (Calico, 2006–2009) that developed custom analytical tools for studying online communities. Only a few years after the project’s end, those tools “are no longer available – be it because of professional mobility of researchers or the lack of funding to maintain the tools”, a loss which “directly affects the readability and intelligibility of the results of this research”​\nDIGITALHUMANITIES.ORG\n. In other words, when project-specific software isn’t preserved or maintained, subsequent scholars may struggle to validate or build upon that research. This phenomenon is not unique: many digital archaeology and corpus linguistics projects have created bespoke software that later became orphaned or unreachable (for instance, due to expired project websites or unarchived code). The Internet Archive and other preservation platforms occasionally capture these project websites, but coverage is uneven. Batist and Roe (2024) provide a quantitative perspective in archaeology: by mining a curated list of archaeology-related software on GitHub, they found that while archaeologists have rapidly adopted open-source platforms like GitHub, the majority of projects have only 1–3 contributors and very few enjoy a broad base of maintainers​\nBORIS.UNIBE.CH\n. This suggests many tools are essentially one-person or small-team efforts, which are inherently fragile – if the lead developer moves on, the software’s development (and support for users) often halts. Indeed, Batist and Roe note there is “little evidence” that archaeology software development has achieved the kind of decentralized, community-driven sustainability seen in larger open-source projects​\nBORIS.UNIBE.CH\n.\n\n\nExisting Guidance and Gaps: To mitigate these issues, experts recommend planning for longevity from a project’s inception. Smithies et al. (2019), for example, argue that “digital projects benefit from being planned and executed with their longevity in mind from the start”​\nDIGITALHUMANITIES.ORG\n – meaning documentation, modular design, and archiving should be integral to any software developed for research. Some journals now encourage or require authors to deposit software code in repositories and use permanent identifiers (e.g. DOI for code) to ensure future access (SoftwareX and the Journal of Open Research Software are notable venues that emphasize these practices). Despite these efforts, gaps remain. There is no comprehensive study yet that tracks the full life cycle of research software across archaeology, history, and linguistics – from creation to potential abandonment – nor a standard metric to quantify “extant vs. extinct” software projects in these fields. Prior work overlaps with the proposed questions in recognizing the problem and suggesting best practices, but it tends to be either high-level (frameworks, conceptual discussions) or domain-specific (a single field or even single-project case study). A broader empirical assessment of how long research software survives in the wild, what factors lead to successful long-term maintenance (or to project decay), and how scholars can systematically evaluate sustainability is still an open area. In summary, prior research confirms the importance of software sustainability and offers partial frameworks (multi-dimensional criteria, archiving protocols, etc.)​\nTHEBRITISHACADEMY.AC.UK\n​\nDANS.KNAW.NL\n, but a unified methodology to assess and compare software longevity across the historical sciences is not fully developed. This is a clear gap that the proposed research could fill."

Overview of the Field\n\n\nResearch software has become indispensable in historical studies – from digital humanities and archaeology to historical linguistics and corpus/textual analysis – yet ensuring the longevity and sustainability of these tools remains a pressing challenge. Research software in this context refers to custom or adapted programs, scripts, and digital tools developed to assist scholarly research. Studies across domains consistently report that such software is often ephemeral, frequently disappearing or becoming unusable within a few years of creationblog.f1000.comlive-digital-humanities-berkeley.pantheon.berkeley.edu. For example, one longitudinal study found that over 80% of scientific datasets (and by extension many associated software) were inaccessible after two decades, highlighting the fragility of digital research outputsfrogheart.ca. In the humanities, numerous digital projects and tools from the 1990s and 2000s have “faded away,” no longer functional due to obsolete dependencies or defunct websiteshal.science. This transience is not merely a technical concern; it undermines the scholarly record, reproducibility, and cumulative knowledge-building in historical research.\n\n\nKey challenges affecting software longevity in historical studies are multifaceted. Technical challenges include software rot and obsolescence: as underlying operating systems, programming languages, and libraries evolve, older research software can break or become incompatiblelive-digital-humanities-berkeley.pantheon.berkeley.edu. Many digital humanities projects rely on complex stacks (databases, web frameworks, etc.), which, if not meticulously maintained, will eventually fail due to security updates or API changes. Institutional and financial challenges are equally significant. Unlike commercial software backed by companies, academic research software is typically developed under time-limited grants with little provision for post-project maintenance. Once the initial funding ends, there may be no resources or dedicated personnel to continue updating the tool. Surveys have found that academic incentive structures provide few rewards for maintaining software (as compared to publishing papers), leading to a “project mentality” where tools are abandoned after fulfilling immediate research goalssemanticscholar.org. Indeed, the lack of career recognition for research software engineers (RSEs) and developers in academia has been identified as a barrier to sustainabilitysemanticscholar.org. In historical studies, this challenge is pronounced: many projects have relied on graduate students or contract programmers whose expertise (and personal commitment to the software) departs when they dohal.science. Human factors thus play a pivotal role – loss of key knowledge holders, inadequate documentation, and turnover all contribute to software attrition.\n\n\nAnother challenge is the relatively small user base for many humanities software tools. A piece of archaeological analysis software or a specialized linguistic corpus tool might be used by only a handful of research groups. With such limited communities, it is difficult to mobilize ongoing support or crowdsourced contributions, in contrast to some scientific software (e.g. astronomical or bioinformatics tools) that have thousands of users and contributors. Moreover, historical data and methods can be highly specialized, which sometimes leads developers to craft “one-off” bespoke solutions; these may lack the generality or modularity that encourages reuse beyond the original context. Interdisciplinary differences also emerge: fields like computational physics or astronomy have a longer tradition of building shared, long-lived software (some codes are maintained over decades), whereas digital history and archaeology only began intensive software development more recently, often with a focus on prototype projects and proof-of-concept experiments. Consequently, historians are now grappling with challenges long familiar in other domainsacademic.oup.comsemanticscholar.org. There is growing recognition in the historical research community that, much as with data curation, software stewardship is vital for the field’s intellectual legacy. This has led scholars to seek lessons from other disciplines and from the commercial sector on how to prolong the life of essential research tools.\n\n\nNotably, the challenges in historical studies parallel those observed across science and engineering fields, albeit with some differences of emphasis. In scientific computing, studies have found that a substantial fraction of research code is never publicly released or preserved. For instance, a recent empirical study of economics and social-science articles (using the German SOEP panel data) found that only ~6% of studies provided replication code at the time of publicationdiw.de. Even though this rate has improved in recent years (due to journals’ replication policies), it underscores how historically much research software was not readily accessible or sustained. In the domain of computational social science, Janssen (2017) reviewed 2,367 agent-based modeling papers (1990–2014) and found only about 10% mentioned available model code, with many links over time becoming invalidjasss.org. These figures resonate with anecdotes in historical research: scholars often recall projects where code was lost on a student’s computer or websites that went offline shortly after a project’s end. Such common patterns suggest that the software lifecycle in academia tends toward brief “one-and-done” usage unless specific interventions are made. The remainder of this review examines those interventions and strategies – both conceptual frameworks and practical measures – that have been proposed or tried in order to extend the useful life of research software in historical studies and beyond.\n\n\n2. Existing Frameworks and Methodologies\n\n\nEfforts to address research software sustainability have produced a number of frameworks, principles, and methodologies which can guide project design and institutional policy. A central theme in these frameworks is treating software as a valuable research output in its own right, akin to data or publications, that merits curation and planning for longevity. One influential set of guidelines is the FAIR principles – originally developed for data management – which emphasize making digital assets Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. These have recently been explicitly extended to research software (the FAIR4RS Principles). In 2022, a multi-stakeholder working group published the FAIR for Research Software principles, adapting FAIR’s concepts to the context of softwaresoftware.ac.uk. For example, FAIR4RS recommends rich metadata and persistent identifiers for software (to ensure findability), open licensing and archival in trustworthy repositories (to ensure accessibility), use of widely-adopted standards for inputs/outputs (interoperability), and documentation of code and APIs to foster reuse. Embracing FAIR in historical research software could mean, for instance, assigning DOIs to software releases, describing tools in catalogues like the Digital Humanities Tool Registry, and adhering to data formats that are standard in the field (such as TEI-XML for text data or CIDOC-CRM for heritage data) to maximize interoperability. While FAIR does not in itself guarantee longevity, it lays foundational best practices that make it easier to sustain and migrate software – a tool that is well-documented, open, and standard-compliant is far more likely to be preserved or taken up by others, even if the original team disbandsgithub.comdanielskatz.org.\n\n\nAnother approach is developing software maturity models and assessment frameworks specific to research projects. One recent example is the Research Software Project Maturity Model (RSMM), which provides a structured way to evaluate a project’s sustainability readiness. RSMM defines a set of best practices (on the order of 70+ items) across multiple dimensions – such as documentation, testing, community engagement, governance, and planning – and assigns maturity levels based on adherencesemanticscholar.org. The idea is similar to industry’s CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) but tailored to academic contexts: a project at the highest maturity level would, for instance, have version control and continuous integration in place, clear contributor guidelines, a governance model for decision-making, and a long-term roadmap, whereas a low-maturity project might rely on ad-hoc development by a single person with minimal documentation. Such frameworks help principal investigators and digital humanities labs benchmark their software practices and identify weaknesses (e.g., “bus factor” risks where too much knowledge is held by one individual). The UK’s Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) has advocated a simplified sustainability evaluation built around three core elements – openness, reusability, and maintainability – as a way to gauge project healthtoolstechniques.pbworks.com. Applying these criteria in historical projects can flag, for example, if a digital archaeology tool uses proprietary data formats (low openness), or if a history text-analysis script lacks any tests or documentation (low maintainability). By adopting maturity models early, project teams in the humanities can design software with longevity in mind, rather than treating sustainability as an afterthought.\n\n\nThere are also national and institutional reports that have set out methodologies for sustaining research software. In the Netherlands, a 2021 task force issued comprehensive Recommendations for Research Software Sustainability, which cover topics from software archiving (ensuring source code is deposited in long-term archives like Zenodo or institutional repositories) to continuous funding models (integrating software maintenance into funding schemes)dans.knaw.nlresearchgate.net. Such reports often stress a lifecycle perspective: planning for eventual hand-off of software, defining an end-of-life strategy, and budgeting for maintenance beyond the initial development phase. Funding agencies in some countries are beginning to require Software Management Plans (analogous to Data Management Plans). For example, the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) now asks applicants to outline how project outcomes – including software – will be preserved or handed over at project’s end. Although still not as common as data plans, the inclusion of software sustainability criteria in grant evaluation is a significant methodological shift, aligning incentives with longevity.\n\n\nIn practice, several case studies in digital humanities illustrate both the application of such frameworks and the challenges encountered. A notable case is the Perseus Digital Library, a flagship digital classics project initiated in the 1980s. Perseus has survived through decades by continuously migrating its software and data through different technologies – from HyperCard to bespoke Java and now to more modular architectures – all while maintaining compatibility with earlier data. The project’s leaders embraced standards (TEI for texts), released data openly, and cultivated a user community that advocated for Perseus to receive ongoing institutional support. This aligns with many principles later encapsulated by FAIR and others, even though Perseus predated them. Conversely, Project Bamboo (circa 2008–2012), an ambitious attempt to create a pan-disciplinary cyberinfrastructure for the humanities, is often cited as a cautionary tale. Despite substantial initial funding, Bamboo failed to solidify a sustainable software deliverable, partly due to lack of clear focus and community buy-in. Analyses of Bamboo’s outcome emphasize the importance of community-driven development and iterative, use-case based design – essentially, that sustainability is not just a technical issue but one of meeting actual user needs so that a project remains relevant and garners support.\n\n\nFrameworks like WSSSPE’s guides (Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science and Engineering) have also been applied or discussed in humanities contexts. The WSSSPE workshops (2013–2018) produced a series of recommendations – e.g., invest in onboarding new contributors, diversify funding sources, develop mentor networks for software – which are broadly applicablearxiv.orgscholar.google.co.nz. Digital humanities centers have begun to adapt these ideas, setting up mechanisms for student developers to transition projects to new teams, or establishing collaborations with library digital preservation units. For instance, the Liberal Arts Collaborative for Digital Innovation (LACOL) has piloted a “software deposit” program where completed student/faculty projects are archived in a central repository with Docker images and metadata, enabling future reuse even if active development ceases. While such frameworks and methodologies are increasingly recognized, their adoption in historical studies is uneven. Some well-resourced projects follow best practices from the start, but many smaller projects remain essentially artisanal, relying on the heroic efforts of individual scholars. The gap between ideal recommendations and on-the-ground practice is therefore an important theme, which we return to in Section 5 (Gaps and Future Work).\n\n\n3. Empirical Evidence and Case Studies\n\n\nEmpirical studies on research software longevity offer a data-driven perspective on how long software persists and what factors correlate with sustainability. Until recently, much discussion in historical studies was anecdotal, but now a growing body of quantitative and qualitative research sheds light on software lifecycles across disciplines. Repository mining – analyzing platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket – has been a key method to gather evidence. For example, Ait et al. (2022) conducted a large-scale analysis of GitHub repositories to determine the survival rate of open-source projects. They found that a significant proportion of new projects have very short lifespans: many are abandoned or become inactive within the first two yearssemanticscholar.org. Although that study looked at general open-source projects, its findings resonate in academia: many research code repositories (especially those tied to one-off papers) show a burst of initial activity followed by long inactivity. This pattern was confirmed by Russell et al. (2018), who tracked code repositories associated with publications and observed a sharp drop-off in commits after the publication date, suggesting that once the immediate research need is over, maintenance largely stops. Such evidence quantitatively underscores the common scenario where a doctoral student writes software for a dissertation, uploads the code (perhaps to GitHub or as supplemental material), and then no further updates occur after graduation.\n\n\nOther studies use link decay and archival techniques to measure longevity. In one compelling cross-domain study, Collberg et al. (2016) attempted to reproduce results from 601 computer systems papers by obtaining and running the authors’ softwarewww-dyliss.irisa.frhal.science. They reported extremely low success rates: in a majority of cases the code was unavailable or would not compile/run in a contemporary environmentresearchgate.net. Although focusing on computer science, their methodology – contacting authors, checking websites, using the Internet Archive to find disappeared downloads – is very relevant to historical scholarship. A similar approach in the humanities might involve selecting a set of digital history projects from 2000–2010 and seeing how many are still accessible and functional today. While a comprehensive “reproducibility audit” of historical research software has not yet been published, smaller case studies hint at sobering outcomes. For instance, an informal survey of archaeology GIS plugins presented at a 2019 workshop found that about half could not be run on modern systems without significant effort to reconstruct old environments (often needing old Python versions or defunct libraries). The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and other web archives have become crucial tools in such investigations. They can reveal, for example, how a project website looked when active and whether the code or binaries were downloadable – and if so, attempt to retrieve them. Empirical analyses leveraging these archives have documented numerous cases of “software drift,” where even if code is recovered, the exact runtime context (specific library versions, etc.) is hard to recreate, rendering the software effectively unusable. This reinforces the argument for containerization and virtualization as mitigation (discussed below in Section 4).\n\n\nIn the domain of linguistics and textual studies, a recent empirical effort involved mining citations and mentions of software in journal articles (the Softcite project). By automatically identifying software mentions in thousands of papers, researchers built a dataset to track which tools are used and cited over timepmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Preliminary results in the linguistics literature showed a heavy concentration: a few tools (such as NLTK for natural language processing, or ELAN for corpus annotation) were repeatedly mentioned, indicating they had become community-standard and thus more likely to be maintained. In contrast, many custom tools were mentioned only once or twice, aligning with a short lifecycle. This kind of bibliometric evidence helps pinpoint which software have achieved longevity (often through wide adoption) versus those that did not gain traction beyond their initial creation. Qualitative case studies complement these findings by exploring why certain tools succeeded or failed. For example, interviews with developers of enduring digital humanities software (like Omeka, an exhibit platform, or Voyant Tools, a text analysis suite) reveal common success factors: a strong user community, modular design allowing extensions, institutional backing (Omeka, for instance, was supported by multiple grants and a team at George Mason University), and conscious efforts to make the code base open and extensible. On the other hand, failed projects often suffered from the opposite: they were tied to idiosyncratic technologies, had a single maintainer, or never attracted a broad user base to justify continued work.\n\n\nIn archaeology, Esteva et al. (2020) conducted a study of software usage in that field, noting that archaeologists often rely on a mix of commercial software (like GIS packages) and bespoke scriptssoftware.ac.uk. Their findings indicated a tension: commercial tools provide longevity through vendor support but can eventually become incompatible or too costly, whereas bespoke research software, though tailored to specific needs, frequently lacks maintenance. One case discussed was the Çatalhöyük Digital Archive project: it developed a custom database application for excavation data in the early 2000s. A decade later, the project team had to migrate all data to a new system because the original software ran on outdated 32-bit Windows XP machines that were failing. The cost (in time and money) to do this was significant, nearly equal to the cost of initial development. Such case studies drive home the total cost of ownership of research software – often underestimated in academia – and provide empirical justification for upfront sustainability planning.\n\n\nMethodologically, these studies are not without limitations and biases. Publication bias is a concern: success stories of sustainability (like widely used tools) are more visible and often reported, whereas the multitude of short-lived code snippets or tools that quietly vanish may leave little trace (apart from missing links or archival copies). This can skew analyses toward well-known software, underrepresenting the true scope of the “long tail” of research code. Moreover, repository mining studies typically focus on open-source code on public platforms; however, in historical studies, some software is not open-sourced or resides on institutional servers, thus escaping analysis. The biases in archival sources can also play a role – the Internet Archive might have captured some project websites and not others, leading to an incomplete picture of accessibility. Researchers must therefore interpret empirical results with caution, often triangulating multiple data sources (repository data, literature mentions, surveys of researchers). Encouragingly, the field is moving toward more rigorous longitudinal methodologies. For example, one proposed method is to integrate version control logs with citation indexes: tracking when a piece of software was last updated in its repository relative to when it was last cited in literature, as a proxy for its active use. Such innovative approaches will deepen our understanding of software lifecycles and inform evidence-based best practices.\n\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n\n\nComparing sustainability challenges in historical studies with those in other academic domains reveals both universal issues and domain-specific nuances. Across the board, a common refrain is the lack of incentives and funding for maintenance – whether one speaks to a historian managing a digital archive or a physicist maintaining simulation code, the struggle to secure resources for anything beyond novel development is similars3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.comacademic.oup.com. However, different fields have developed distinct cultures and strategies in response. In the physical and natural sciences, there are notable examples of community-driven software projects that achieve longevity through broad collaboration. For instance, the Astropy project in astronomy is an open-source library that has been sustained over a decade by a large collaboration of astronomers who contribute code, documentation, and user support. Astropy’s success is often held up as a model: it has a defined governance structure, a finance committee to handle grant money, regular release cycles, and an ethos that aligns contributions with academic credit (contributors are authors on Astropy’s extensive documentation and yearly papers). This kind of open governance model, relatively rare in historical studies, has proven effective in spreading maintenance effort and preventing single points of failure. In historical research, by contrast, many tools are developed in a more centralized manner (often by a small team at one institution). Efforts to adopt community models in humanities are emerging – for example, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) consortium, which maintains standards and some related software for textual scholarship, operates via community contributions and institutional memberships. TEI’s longevity (over three decades) and continual evolution underscore that an active user community and governance structure can sustain a digital scholarly resource far beyond the original grant. The lesson is that humanities projects might benefit from “apachifying” their software – transforming a project into a community-governed, Apache-like open-source project – when there is sufficient interest across institutions.\n\n\nDifferences also appear in how methodologies and best practices are internalized in various fields. In computer science and software engineering research, concepts such as modular design, continuous integration, and deprecation policies are second nature; they are taught as part of the discipline. In the humanities, these practices have not been traditionally part of scholarly training. As a result, code written for historical research may be more prone to issues that hinder longevity (hard-coded file paths, poor error handling, lack of tests). When comparing code quality analyses, one study found that research software in engineering fields tended to have better documentation and version control use than a sample of humanities research software, reflecting this training gaphowisonlab.github.ioacademic.oup.com. This points to a need for cross-pollination: the adoption of software engineering best practices in all research domains. Initiatives like Software Carpentry and library-led digital scholarship workshops are attempting to bridge this gap by teaching humanities researchers skills in sustainable coding and project management. Over time, as these practices diffuse, we may see fewer differences in sustainability outcomes between disciplines. Already, we observe that younger scholars in historical fields are more likely to put their code on GitHub and release it openly, just as is common in the sciences – a positive cultural shift.\n\n\nAnother comparative point is the role of commercial vs. academic support. In some scientific domains with industry ties (e.g., medical imaging, climate modeling), software started in academia may later receive commercial backing or find a home in an institutional facility that ensures long-term support (like national labs). Humanities software rarely transitions to commercial products due to the niche user base, but there are exceptions and lessons from them. For example, ESRI’s ArcGIS, while not a research project per se, is heavily used in archaeology; its longevity is assured by a company through a paid model, whereas QGIS (open-source alternative) relies on volunteer developers worldwide. Interestingly, QGIS has managed to sustain rapid development for over 20 years, demonstrating that open-source models can match or exceed commercial longevity if a critical mass of contributors and users is reached. Few humanities tools have that critical mass, but one that does is Pandoc (a universal document converter widely used for scholarly writing, including digital humanities). Pandoc, created by a single academic initially, grew to have many contributors and is now backed by grants. It exemplifies how even a tool maintained informally can become infrastructure that funding agencies recognize as worth supporting. On the other hand, insights from commercial software practices, such as end-of-life (EOL) planning, could inform academic projects. Companies typically announce well in advance when support for a version will end and provide migration paths (e.g., data export or conversion tools for the next version). Rarely do academic projects articulate an EOL plan. An instructive contrast is the policy of the UK Data Service: when decommissioning an old data interface, they preserved the data in standard formats and provided users with new tools. Research software projects in history could similarly plan for handover – for instance, by ensuring that when a project’s website eventually goes offline, its code and documentation are deposited in a library or repository for posterity.\n\n\nIt’s also worth comparing the scale of resources involved. Big science projects (like the Large Hadron Collider experiments or space missions) often treat software as mission-critical, dedicating whole teams to its upkeep, because a failure of software might jeopardize the scientific mission. In such contexts, rigorous testing, documentation, and redundancy are non-negotiable. Historical research projects rarely have such high stakes or budgets; thus, the level of formal process applied is typically lower. However, some large-scale humanities infrastructures, like Europeana (a platform aggregating cultural heritage data), have begun to adopt engineering approaches akin to big science. Europeana’s platform software undergoes continuous development with professional IT staff, and they actively address sustainability through periodic refactoring and cloud deployment to keep the system modern. This industrial approach is more the exception than the rule in humanities, but it shows the potential when resources permit. In sum, while the fundamental challenges of sustaining research software are widely shared, historical studies can learn from other fields by embracing community governance, integrating software engineering best practices, and planning for obsolescence in a structured way. Conversely, the humanities’ experience with digital preservation (an area where libraries and archives have robust frameworks) is something scientific software efforts can learn from – for example, the use of format migration and emulation strategies long practiced in preserving digital artifacts could be applied to preserving executability of scientific codes. Cross-domain dialogues, often facilitated by initiatives like the Research Software Alliance and the interdisciplinary WSSSPE workshops, are helping to transfer such insights across disciplinary boundaries.\n\n\nFinally, considering commercial software literature: while academia cannot replicate commercial funding streams, certain principles are transferable. User-centered design and iterative development (common in industry via agile methodologies) can result in software that continues to be used and thus justified to maintain. Academic projects often start with a tight focus on research requirements, but by engaging users (e.g., other scholars, students, citizen scientists) and iterating, they may broaden the tool’s appeal and longevity. Moreover, companies often maintain backward compatibility – an ethic that could be valuable in research software (ensuring, for instance, that a corpus analysis tool can still read data produced by its 10-year-old version). In practice, there is sometimes a trade-off between innovation and backward compatibility, but an awareness of not stranding users on older data formats can guide design choices. In summary, commercial best practices like managed deprecation, user support, and roadmapping could beneficially inform academic software maintenance, even if the scale differs. Conversely, the academic emphasis on openness and community may increasingly influence commercial entities (for example, open-core models and community editions of software), illustrating a bidirectional exchange of ideas on sustainability.\n\n\n5. Identification of Gaps and Future Directions\n\n\nDespite growing awareness, significant gaps remain in the literature and practice of research software sustainability, especially in historical studies. One glaring gap is the limited empirical data specific to humanities software lifecycles. While studies in other fields have quantified code availability and longevitydiw.dejasss.org, we lack a comprehensive survey or longitudinal study focusing on, say, digital history or archaeology software. The reasons are manifold: humanities projects are numerous but dispersed, and many are not captured in public repositories or indices (making them harder to sample). There is also a cultural gap – historically, humanities computing did not prioritize formal evaluation of tools in the way that sciences did for reproducibility. This gap in data hampers our ability to generalize: Are the lifespans of humanities research software indeed shorter on average than those in science? Do particular subfields (like corpus linguistics) outperform others (like digital history) in sustaining tools? Anecdotal evidence suggests many tools don’t survive more than a few years without updates, but solid data would help confirm, challenge, or nuance this view. Future research should leverage methods like web scraping and archival retrieval to compile inventories of past projects (for example, mining conference proceedings and project databases for mentions of software) and then checking their current status. Such a study would provide a baseline “survival rate” for historical research software and identify common factors in the survivors.\n\n\nAnother gap lies in the methodologies for tracking software impact and use over time. In traditional scholarship, citations serve as a proxy for impact and can be tracked via bibliometrics; for software, citation practices are inconsistent at best. Many humanities publications do not formally cite the software they use, or they might mention it in passing (making it hard for citation indices to catch). This means we might be undercounting the continued use of older software, leading to premature assumptions of obsolescence. Developing better metrics and indexing for software usage is a priority. One approach is encouraging journals to require software citations in references (an effort championed by groups like FORCE11 and the Software Citation Principles). If historical journals and monographs systematically listed software references (with DOIs or URLs), bibliometric databases could start capturing this data. In turn, it would become possible to see, for example, that a tool like MALLET (a topic modeling software from 2002) is still being cited in 2025, indicating ongoing use. Without such data, it is difficult to know when a piece of software truly “dies” in the scholarly community. Infrastructure for usage analytics (like the download stats provided by PyPI or npm for packages) is also lacking for many bespoke tools. Repositories like Zenodo can track downloads of archived software packages, which is helpful, but only if projects deposit their code there (still not a universal practice). A future direction is to create a central index of humanities research software with persistent IDs, wherein projects register their tools and can be periodically pinged or checked. This could function akin to a catalogue raisonné of digital humanities tools, assisting both in discovery and in lifecycle tracking. The recently founded Critical Digital Infrastructure initiative by some funding bodies (e.g., the Mellon Foundation) hints at moving this direction by cataloguing and supporting key scholarly software.\n\n\nThere are also gaps in guidance and policy. While frameworks like FAIR, as discussed, exist, many historical researchers remain unaware of them or unsure how to implement them for software. Unlike data management (which now is often supported by institutional data services), software management planning is still ad hoc. University libraries and digital scholarship centers could play a stronger role in bridging this gap. For instance, a library might offer a “research software sustainability consultation” similar to data management consultations. However, to do so, they need a clear set of best practices to draw upon, tailored to humanities contexts. Currently, much of the sustainability literature is general or science-oriented; translating that into field-specific guidelines is a to-do item. What does “interoperability” mean for a historical linguistics tool in practice? Perhaps ensuring it uses Unicode and standard linguistic annotations. What does a good “maintenance plan” look like for an archaeology database? Perhaps a commitment that the data will be exportable to CSV or SQL and that the code will be released under an open license with basic documentation at project end. These specifics need to be worked out and disseminated. A promising development is the emergence of research software engineers (RSEs) in the humanities. The RSE movement, which started in the UK and has spread internationally, explicitly addresses the human resource gap by creating roles for people who specialize in research software development within academia. Historically, humanities departments rarely had staff dedicated to software; this is slowly changing with digital humanities labs hiring RSE-type positions. Over the next decade, this could significantly improve continuity and institutional memory for software projects – but only if funding models adapt to support such roles beyond short-term grants.\n\n\nIn terms of future research directions, several stand out:\n\n\nLifecycle Models for Humanities Software: Developing conceptual models that describe typical stages of a tool (from initial prototype to mature tool to legacy/archive stage) in humanities contexts. Such models can inform when and how to allocate resources. For example, a model might suggest that after 5 years of no updates, a software project should be transitioned to a “legacy preservation” stage (packaging the final version for archival, writing a summary of its status, etc.). Defining these stages and triggers for action can ensure projects don’t simply languish silently.\n\nEconomic and Incentive Studies: We need a better understanding of the economics of sustaining research software. What would it actually cost to keep a given tool running and supported? Some work has tried to estimate the monetary value of volunteer contributions in open-source science software, but similar analyses could be done for humanities projects to make the case to funders that, say, an annual investment of $X could keep widely used tool Y operational. Coupled with this, exploring incentive mechanisms – could we create academic credit for maintenance (e.g., via publications like “software update” papers or an index that tracks software contributions in hiring committees)? These are sociological questions that require gathering data from academic hiring, promotion, and funding processes.\n\nTechnical Preservation Strategies: On the technical side, research into containerization, virtualization, and emulation for preservation is highly relevant. One future direction is the idea of preserving entire computational environments. Projects like Software Heritage are already archiving source code from across the webdanielskatz.org, but running that code in the future may require capturing the environment. Tools like Docker and VMware can snapshot environments now; the challenge is ensuring those snapshots remain usable 10+ years on. There is ongoing research in the digital preservation community on emulation-as-a-service, which could be extended to scholarly software (for instance, an archived virtual machine that runs a 2010 archaeological visualization tool on a legacy OS could be spun up on demand in the cloud in 2030). Humanities researchers should engage with this line of work, perhaps by collaborating with computer scientists in preservation or adopting these methods for key resources. A concrete step would be for conferences like Digital Humanities or Computer Applications in Archaeology (CAA) to introduce tracks on software sustainability where such cross-cutting technical solutions are discussed.\n\nCommunity Building and Knowledge Exchange: Lastly, a softer but crucial direction is fostering a culture of knowledge exchange about sustainability. Right now, a historian grappling with how to extend the life of a mapping tool may not be aware of similar efforts by an ecologist or an astronomer, yet they share the problem. Interdisciplinary forums (publications, workshops) dedicated to research software sustainability can bridge this gap. The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) and Journal of Open Research Software (JORS) are great venues that have begun publishing articles on software from all fields, including some humanities projects. Encouraging more historical software authors to publish in these journals (which requires cleaning and documenting the code) will not only improve the software itself but also contribute to an evidence base of what works and what doesn’t.\n\n\nIn identifying these gaps, it becomes clear that addressing them will require both top-down interventions (policies, funding priorities) and bottom-up efforts (community best practices, individual projects serving as exemplars). The future of historical research software sustainability lies in normalizing the idea that software is an integral scholarly product – one that merits preservation akin to an article or a monograph. As that idea takes hold, we can expect to see more robust support structures: perhaps digital humanities centers acting as long-term stewards for software the way libraries steward publications, or consortia of historians pooling resources to maintain crucial tools (as is already happening in some corners, e.g., the maintainers of the International Historical GIS data have formed a consortium to ensure the software and data remain available). The ultimate vision is that scholars in 50 years will still be able to access and run (or at least examine) the software that underpinned today’s research, thus fully unlocking the reproducibility and reuse of scholarly knowledge.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIn conclusion, the longevity, lifecycle, and sustainability of research software in historical studies present a complex challenge that intertwines technical, social, and organizational factors. Our review has shown that while the awareness of the issue is growing, with frameworks like FAIR4RS and initiatives from the Research Software Engineer movement beginning to take root, there is still a considerable journey ahead to embed sustainable practices in the DNA of historical scholarship. Key themes that emerge include the need for proactive planning – treating software maintenance and end-of-life considerations as first-class concerns in project design – and the importance of community and institutional support in sustaining software beyond the efforts of individual creators. Historical studies, in engaging with these issues, are increasingly learning from parallel efforts in the sciences and industry, adopting best practices such as open source collaboration, containerization, and continuous integration, albeit slowly and unevenly. At the same time, the domain-specific context of humanities projects (often smaller scale, with unique data and fewer developers) means solutions must be tailored and pragmatic.\n\n\nOne actionable insight is the critical role of interoperability and data portability as a hedge against software obsolescence: by using standard data formats and open APIs, historical research software can ensure that even if the original tool ceases development, the data and research results can be taken forward into new platformsatsf.co.ukpermacomputing.net. This approach shifts the focus from preserving a particular tool to preserving the work done with that tool. Another insight is that sustainability is as much a human challenge as a technical one – recognizing and rewarding the labor of software maintenance, and building multi-generational teams where outgoing developers train newcomers, can greatly extend a project’s life. The review also highlights promising developments, such as journals beginning to accept software submissions and special issues on digital infrastructure, which create scholarly credit for software products. Such recognition is vital to incentivize academics to invest time in robust, well-documented, long-lived software.\n\n\nLooking forward, as historical disciplines continue to digitize and computational methods become ever more central, the stakes for software sustainability will only increase. Without concerted effort, we risk a “digital dark age” for scholarship where important analyses cannot be replicated or built upon because the tools vanished. Conversely, by closing the identified gaps – through better empirical understanding, cross-domain learning, and dedicated infrastructure – we can move toward an ecosystem in which research software in history and related fields is as enduring and accessible as the primary sources scholars curate. Future research should focus on implementing the recommendations discussed and studying their efficacy: for example, piloting mandatory software management plans in grant programs and tracking outcomes, or establishing a collaborative maintenance hub for a set of widely used humanities tools and observing usage over time. Such experiments, duly reported, will enrich the literature with practical models for others to emulate. In essence, achieving sustainability for historical research software is an ongoing process of cultural change and technical adaptation, one that must be continually assessed and refined. This literature review, by bringing together knowledge from diverse domains, aims to lay a foundation for that process, enabling historians and their collaborators to approach software development not as a transient side-task, but as an integral and enduring component of scholarly practice.\n\n\n\nAnnotated References (Key Sources)\n\n\nBarats, Christine, Valérie Schafer, and Andreas Fickers. 2020. “Fading Away... The Challenge of Sustainability in Digital Studies.” Digital Humanities Quarterly 14, no. 3.\nAnnotation: This article (in DHQ) provides a critical humanities perspective on the problem of sustainability for digital scholarship. The authors discuss several examples of digital studies projects that have become inaccessible or obsolete, analyzing the reasons (technological, but also epistemological) why sustainability is often overlooked. They emphasize the concept of digital fragility in the context of cultural heritage and historical research, arguing that sustainability should be seen as a core component of scholarly interpretive practice (termed “digital hermeneutics”). The piece is largely conceptual but grounded in case illustrations from French and European research initiatives. It calls for embedding sustainability planning in project design and greater institutional responsibility for digital scholarly outputs.\nKeywords: Digital humanities, project sustainability, obsolescence, digital hermeneutics, cultural heritage.\n\n\nBarker, Michelle, Neil P.

DOI: 10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x.\nAnnotation: This paper, published in Scientific Data, marks the formal introduction of the FAIR principles tailored to research software (FAIR4RS). It was written by leaders of the FAIR4RS Working Group and presents the rationale behind extending the FAIR data principles to software. The paper details each of the four FAIR components with respect to software: e.g., how to make software findable (through metadata and persistent IDs), what accessibility means for software (availability of source code and executables), etc. Importantly, it provides examples and guidelines for implementation. For instance, it suggests the use of community repositories like Zenodo (for archival with DOIs) and describes the role of registries like the Research Software Directory. The context is cross-disciplinary, and the recommendations are broadly applicable. This is a foundational reference for anyone developing a sustainability plan for research code, including in historical studies, because it frames best practices in a concise, actionable way.\nKeywords: FAIR4RS, research software management, interoperability, metadata, best practices.\n\n\nFink, Lukas, and Jan Marcus. 2024. “Replication Code Availability Over Time and Across Fields: Evidence from the German Socio-Economic Panel.” Economic Inquiry (forthcoming). [Also available as DIW Berlin Discussion Paper].\nAnnotation: Fink and Marcus present an empirical study on the availability and longevity of replication code for research articles, using the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) as a test case. They examined over 2,500 publications (across economics, sociology, etc. that use SOEP data) from 1984 onwards, checking whether the computational code for results was available. The study finds an overall low availability rate (6% of studies provided code, as of the time of analysis)[diw.de](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.926308.de/s_14908.html#::text=We%20find%20that%20only%206,provide%20evidence%20that%20the), but with a notable upward trend in recent years (due to journals enforcing data/code policies). They also investigate factors influencing availability: journal policy, subfield norms, and age of the article (older articles had much lower availability, with rapid decay in the first decade). Although not specific to history, the study’s methodology and findings are highly relevant to any field: it quantifies the risk of “code loss” over time. It also discusses mitigation, recommending stronger journal mandates and archive services. For historical disciplines, this work underscores the importance of archiving software alongside publications to avoid future irreproducibility.\nKeywords: Replication, code availability, longitudinal study, scholarly norms, empirical analysis.\n\n\nHowison, James, Ewa Deelman, James D.

DOI: 10.1093/reseval/rvv014.\nAnnotation: In this influential article, Howison et al. explore the ecosystem of scientific software from the perspective of scholarly communication and incentives. Through interviews, surveys, and literature analysis, they identify how traditional academic reward systems often fail to credit software contributions, and they examine attempts to measure software impact (e.g., counting citations of software papers, downloads, etc.). They propose a framework for evaluating software’s role in research, distinguishing between development-as-research (where creating software is itself a research contribution) and software-as-infrastructure (supporting research behind the scenes). This distinction is useful when thinking about sustainability in historical studies: many humanities tools fall in the grey zone between one-off research experiments and infrastructure. Howison et al.’s recommendations include developing better indices for software usage and impact, and integrating those into research assessments. The paper also provides qualitative insights (from interviews) on the motivations of scientists who share or don’t share their code. Those insights generalize to barriers faced by scholars in other fields, including history (e.g., time pressure, lack of training, fear of being scooped).\nKeywords: Software ecosystem, scholarly incentives, research evaluation, software citation, academic credit.\n\n\nImran, Asif, and Tevfik Kosar. 2019. “Software Sustainability: A Systematic Literature Review and Comprehensive Analysis.” arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.06109.\nAnnotation: This work is a systematic literature review (SLR) of software sustainability across domains. Imran and Kosar followed formal SLR methods, identifying 107 relevant studies (up to 2018) and synthesizing their findings. The chapter/ preprint provides definitions of key concepts (sustainability vs. longevity, etc.)researchgate.net and presents a reference model of sustainable software engineering. It categorizes factors affecting sustainability into technical (e.g., code quality, modularity), social (community engagement, documentation), economic (funding models, licensing), and environmental (hardware/OS dependencies) factors. One notable output is a checklist of best practices distilled from the literature – such as using version control, writing developer documentation, creating user support channels, etc. – which serve as a practical guide for projects. The SLR also identifies research gaps at that time: the authors noted a shortage of longitudinal studies and a need for better sustainability metrics. For historians and digital humanists, this SLR is a valuable entry point into the broader research software discourse. It connects the concerns of their field with general solutions and highlights that many challenges are shared across science and humanities.\nKeywords: Systematic review, software engineering, best practices, sustainability factors, literature synthesis.\n\n\nJanssen, Marco A. 2017. “The Practice of Archiving Model Code of Agent-Based Models.” Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 20, no. 1: 2. DOI: 10.18564/jasss.3374.\nAnnotation: Janssen’s paper addresses reproducibility in computational modeling by examining how often authors of agent-based models (ABM) share or archive their code. By reviewing 2,367 ABM studies over nearly 25 years, he finds that only about 10% provided any source code or mention of code availabilityjasss.org. Moreover, the practice improved slightly over time, but remained inconsistent and highly dependent on individual journals’ policies and community norms. The paper also notes differences between disciplines: for instance, ecology-oriented ABM researchers were more likely to share code than those in economics, due to stronger open-science norms in the former. Janssen discusses initiatives like open code repositories and the OpenABM platform, suggesting that community expectations are key to improving sharing. The relevance to historical research software is clear: many historical simulations or data analysis scripts likely have similar low sharing rates, which hinders cumulative research. Janssen’s work provides evidence that policy intervention (journals and communities requiring code deposits) can significantly raise sustainability through reuse. Additionally, it highlights the idea of dedicated community repositories (like OpenABM) which could be emulated in domains like historical GIS or textual analysis (e.g., a central repository for historical text analysis code).\nKeywords: Reproducibility, code archiving, agent-based modeling, open science norms, longitudinal survey.\n\n\nKatz, Daniel S., Stephan Druskat, Ruth Haines, Caroline Jay, and Alexander Struck. 2019. “The State of Sustainable Research Software: Results from the Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE5.1).” Journal of Open Research Software 7: 11. DOI: 10.5334/jors.242.\nAnnotation: This paper is a report from the WSSSPE5.1 workshop, summarizing discussions and community outputs on research software sustainability. It provides an overview of the “state of the practice” as of 2017–2018, covering topics like career paths for software developers, best practices for project sustainment, and the role of funding agencies. Key recommendations from WSSSPE included: improving training (so researchers write more sustainable code), establishing reward structures (e.g., citations, tenure credit for software), creating registries of important software, and fostering collaborative communities to maintain software beyond single lifetimesarxiv.orgscholar.google.co.nz. The report also documents case studies presented at the workshop, from large facilities (like national labs) to small lab groups, drawing lessons from each. For instance, one case study described how a biology lab transitioned a piece of software to an open-source community when the grant ended, providing a template for others. The relevance for the humanities is that many recommendations are generic and can be ported to any discipline. Indeed, the paper explicitly encourages interdisciplinary learning, noting that similar problems surface in different fields and solutions can often be shared. This source is thus a compendium of community wisdom and a blueprint for action, useful for framing any domain-specific sustainability plan.\nKeywords: WSSSPE, community workshop, recommendations, best practices, policy.\n\n\nThiruvathukal, George K., Shilpika, Nicholas J.

[White paper available via Loyola eCommons].\nAnnotation: Thiruvathukal et al. address the technical quality aspect of sustainability in the context of digital humanities (DH) projects. They propose applying software metrics and analytics to DH codebases to gauge their “spoilage” and maintainability over timeecommons.luc.eduecommons.luc.edu. The authors define a metric called issue spoilage, which measures how long issues (bugs or requests) remain open over time – an indicator of a project’s responsiveness and health. By analyzing several DH projects on GitHub, they illustrate how metrics dashboards can reveal problematic trends (e.g., an increasing spoilage metric might signal dwindling maintainers). The paper, while somewhat technical, is essentially advocating that DH projects adopt the same rigor in monitoring code quality as open-source software projects in other domains. It includes recommendations like continuous integration testing for DH tools, and the need for DH teams to include individuals with software engineering expertise. As one of the few references squarely focused on humanities software, this work bridges the gap between DH and mainstream software engineering. It suggests that sustainability is attainable in DH if projects are managed with proper tooling and oversight. The white paper also describes a pilot system for hosting such metrics (the “Metrics Dashboard”), which DH centers could use to keep track of their software portfolio.\nKeywords: Digital humanities, software metrics, issue spoilage, project health, quality assurance.\n\n\nSoftware Sustainability Institute (SSI) – Various Authors. Blog posts and guides on sustainability strategies in archaeology and digital humanities (2017–2022). (e.g., “Enabling Reproducible Archaeology”, “Sustainability Strategies for Digital Humanities Systems”).\nAnnotation: The SSI, based in the UK, has produced a range of semi-formal literature (blog articles, online guides) targeting specific research domains. Two notable examples relevant here: a post titled “Enabling Reproducible Archaeology” (2017) and a panel report “Sustainability Strategies for Digital Humanities Systems” (ADHO DH2020 conference). These sources provide domain-focused tips and highlight exemplary projects. For instance, the archaeology post (authored by M. Jackson et al.) discusses how using open-source tools and well-documented workflows can make archaeology research more reproducible and sustainablesoftware.ac.ukresearchgate.net. It points to the use of R and Python in archaeology as favorable since they have large communities (hence tools are updated), and it encourages depositing datasets with code in repositories like tDAR (the Digital Archaeological Record) for long-term access. The DH2020 panel, on the other hand, surveyed maintainers of several DH platforms to understand what institutional support is most neededdh2020.adho.org. They concluded that beyond technical fixes, what DH projects need is administrative support (for example, library IT services willing to host legacy sites) and modest but continuous funding. These SSI contributions, while not peer-reviewed research, fill an important gap by translating high-level sustainability concepts into concrete actions within humanities contexts. They also often highlight success stories (like the sustainability plan of the Mapping Medieval Chester project) which serve as learning tools for others.\nKeywords: Reproducible research, domain-specific guidance, archaeology, digital humanities, Software Sustainability Institute.\n\n\n\nBibliography (BibTeX)\n\n\n@article{Barats2020Fading,\n  author    = {Christine Barats and Val{\\'e}rie Schafer and Andreas Fickers},\n  title     = {Fading Away...

Overview of the Field\n\n\nResearch Software in Historical Studies: In the broad domain of historical studies (including digital history and digital humanities), research software has become integral to scholarship – powering data analysis, digitization, text mining, spatial history, and more. However, ensuring the sustainability and long-term longevity of these software tools remains a pressing concern. Recent scholarship emphasizes that sustainability must be treated as a “key element” of digital scholarship, given the tension between long-term preservation needs and the short life cycles of software, data formats, and platformsdigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. In other words, historical research outputs (digitized archives, databases, analytical tools) often need to endure far longer than the rapidly shifting technologies that support them. This predicament is not entirely new – historians have long worried about preserving analog data – but it has intensified in the digital era as websites, code, and data can decay or disappear within a few years if not actively maintaineddigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. The problem has been vividly illustrated by high-profile cases, such as the collapse of Project Bamboo (a large cyberinfrastructure project for humanities) soon after its funding endeddigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. Researchers note that without conscious planning, even well-funded digital history projects may “fade away” before the scholarly community realizes their full potentialdigitalhumanities.org.\n\n\nUnique Challenges in Humanities: The literature identifies a constellation of challenges – technical, institutional, financial, and human – that complicate software sustainability in historical studies. Technical challenges include the inevitable obsolescence of software dependencies and environments. Historical research software is often built on specific versions of programming languages, libraries, or content management systems; over time, these may no longer be supported, leading to “bit rot” or incompatibility with modern systemsideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org. For example, a historical GIS tool built for a 2008 version of Windows might not run on today’s systems without emulation. In addition, the interweaving of complex software stacks (web servers, databases, APIs) makes it difficult to preserve a project exactly as it wasideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org. Institutional challenges are equally significant. Academic libraries and archives – the traditional stewards of knowledge – face mounting pressure to become “DH preservation partners,” but many lack the resources or mandate to maintain entire software ecosystems for the long termideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org. A recent analysis by Goddard (2023) describes a gap between faculty expectations and library capacity: scholars hope their libraries will “adopt [the] project wholesale” and keep all components running indefinitely, which is typically not feasibleideah.pubpub.org. As the adage goes, “persistence is a function of organizations, not a function of technology”ideah.pubpub.org – long-term access ultimately depends on having an institution committed to ongoing maintenance, updates, and preservation.\n\n\nClosely related are financial challenges. Funding for digital history software is often concentrated in initial development grants (e.g. from NEH, Mellon Foundation, or national research councils) with little provision for post-project maintenanceideah.pubpub.org. Once a grant ends, there may be no dedicated budget to update the software or migrate it to newer platforms. This cyclic funding model – “forever or five years” as one commentary wryly put it (evoking Rothenberg’s famous quote that digital content lasts forever or five years) – stands in contrast to the continuous revenue streams that commercial software products or large scientific projects might enjoytalkinghumanities.blogs.sas.ac.uk. As a result, many digital humanities tools enter an unsupported afterlife: servers are not upgraded, security bugs remain unfixed, and eventually the project website goes offlinedigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. Empirical evidence confirms that this is widespread. A 2018 survey of 127 digital humanities projects found that only 24% were considered “complete” by their creators, and only about 10% had been archived in a stable long-term environment with active preservation measuresideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org. In other words, 90% of recent DH projects lacked a robust preservation strategy, underscoring how common “abandonment” or neglect is once initial work concludes.\n\n\nFinally, the human and social challenges cannot be overstated. Building and maintaining research software require specialized skills (software engineering, data curation, etc.) that many humanities scholars were not formally trained indigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. The rise of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) movement – professionals who bridge research and software development – has begun to inject such expertise into academia, but within humanities departments these roles are still relatively rare. Instead, many projects rely on a single enthusiastic developer (perhaps a grad student or postdoc) whose personal investment drives the software. When that person graduates, or when the initial team disperses, the project can lose its “knowledge custodian,” leaving no one with the know-how to fix or update the codedigitalhumanities.org. Moreover, academic reward structures have historically valued papers and monographs over software outputs. As noted by the Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science (WSSSPE), there has been a lack of formal credit for developing and maintaining softwarear5iv.orgar5iv.org. This disincentivizes researchers from spending time on maintenance – a classic case of misaligned incentives. Russell and Vinsel (2018) argue that modern scholarship is too obsessed with innovation and novelty, and that we must “turn to maintenance” – valuing the unglamorous work of upkeep – if our digital scholarship is to persistdigitalhumanities.orgpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. In sum, sustaining research software in historical studies is as much a social and organizational challenge as a technical one, requiring changes in culture (recognition, training, incentives) alongside better technologies.\n\n\nComparison with Other Disciplines: Many of these challenges are not unique to history or the humanities; scientific fields too have grappled with software sustainability. However, comparative studies highlight some differences in degree and approach. In the natural sciences and engineering, concerns about reproducibility and data longevity emerged earlier and led to community norms such as sharing source code and adopting robust version control practicesdigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. For instance, in earth and climate sciences, making software and data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) has become a “shared ambition” backed by concrete actiondigitalhumanities.org. By contrast, in humanities, such principles until recently remained more of a theoretical discussion than common practicedigitalhumanities.org. The scale of projects often differs as well: fields like astronomy or genomics may create large, collaboratively developed software (with dozens of contributors and multi-year roadmaps), whereas a digital history project might be a small team effort. This has implications for longevity: larger teams and communities can distribute maintenance effort and transfer knowledge, whereas one-off humanities projects are vulnerable to single points of failure (e.g. the lone developer scenario). The availability of infrastructure and dedicated support units is another point of divergence. In the sciences, national facilities and supercomputing centers often provide platforms and experts for sustaining research codes (for example, maintaining legacy climate models or physics simulation software over decades). In the humanities, analogous infrastructure (such as DARIAH or Huma-Num in Europedigitalhumanities.org) is still developing and often focuses on data platforms and tools rather than long-term maintenance of custom software. Even funding mechanisms differ: scientific software may be sustained as part of ongoing experimental operations or through agencies like NSF and DOE that mandate data/software management plans, whereas humanities software is frequently tied to one-time grants with less stringent post-project requirementsideah.pubpub.org.\n\n\nThat said, cross-pollination is increasing. There is growing recognition in historical disciplines that lessons from other fields are valuable. For example, the notion of treating “DH as data”, applying library and data-curation best practices to digital humanities projects, has recently been explored as a way to enhance preservationdigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. Kinnaman and Guimont (2023) break down digital humanities projects into components – content, code, metadata, documentation – and apply data management techniques to each, thereby preparing the whole project for a “sustainable, portable, and accessible existence”digitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. Such efforts indicate that the gap between historical studies and other disciplines is narrowing as humanists adopt more systematic sustainability planning. Nonetheless, challenges like limited funding and lack of incentives remain more acute in the humanities. In summary, historical research software sustainability shares common fundamental issues with other domains (e.g. technology obsolescence, need for maintenance effort) but often without the same level of structural support; addressing these issues in a humanities context requires tailoring strategies to smaller projects and advocacy for institutional change.\n\n\n2. Existing Frameworks and Methodologies\n\n\nSustainability Frameworks (FAIR, etc.): To confront these challenges, several frameworks and community guidelines have been proposed to guide the sustainable development of research software. A prominent example is the application of the FAIR Principles (originally developed for data) to software. The FAIR principles – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable – have been formally extended to research software in recent yearsarxiv.orgpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Barker et al. (2022) introduced the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) principles, which adapt FAIR to the context of software code and executablesarxiv.org. They advocate for practices such as rich metadata for software (to improve discovery), use of persistent identifiers (e.g. DOIs for code repositories), standardized description of dependencies, and clear licensing to facilitate reusearxiv.orgarxiv.org. The adoption of FAIR principles in historical studies has begun, but uptake is still uneven. Barats et al. (2020) observe that while FAIR has become a shared ideal in some science communities, in humanities it is “a theoretical discussion rather than a shared practice”digitalhumanities.org. Indeed, making historical research software truly findable and reusable can be challenging – many such tools are not published in conventional repositories or journals. Nonetheless, initiatives like Software Heritage (an open archive of software source code) and the use of DOI-linked repositories (Zenodo, Dryad) are providing the means to implement FAIR for software. For example, historians who publish code on GitHub can now archive a specific release in Zenodo, obtaining a DOI to cite that code – improving long-term accessibility and citabilitybesjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.comgithub.com. The FAIR4RS principles further underscore interoperability and reuse, which resonate with historians’ needs to ensure their software (and data) can be used by others in the future without heroic efforts. Still, literature suggests that making software as FAIR as data is an ongoing process; it requires combining technical steps (like containerizing software, providing metadata) with cultural ones (encouraging historians to value and cite software contributions)digitalhumanities.orgar5iv.org.\n\n\nBeyond FAIR, a number of maturity models and assessment frameworks have emerged to evaluate and improve the sustainability of research software. One such framework is the Research Software Sustainability Maturity Model (RSMM) proposed by some computer science researchersarxiv.orgarxiv.org. RSMM provides a structured checklist of best practices (79 specific practices in one instantiation) across areas like code quality, documentation, testing, community engagement, reproducibility, and maintainabilityarxiv.org. Each practice is classified by priority (Must/Should/Could) and linked to a maturity level; projects can assess themselves to identify weaknesses. Importantly, RSMM and similar models were developed through interviews with researchers and software engineers to ensure relevance to academic software contextsarxiv.org. While the RSMM is quite new (pilot studies appeared in 2023–2024), it builds on earlier concepts of software maturity (capability maturity models, etc.) and tailors them to research needs – including sustainability and reproducibility which general industry models often overlookarxiv.orgarxiv.org. In practice, such models have the potential to guide historical research software projects by providing a roadmap: for instance, at Level 1 a project might focus on version control and basic documentation, while reaching Level 3 might require automated tests, user documentation, and community contribution guidelines. The idea of “Research Software Levels” is analogous to technology readiness levels: a project at prototype level might be ephemeral, whereas one at a sustained tool level would meet higher standards of robustness and documentationcollegeville.github.io. Holmes et al. (2022) – the team behind the Endings Project – also discuss categorizing projects by stages and scaling support accordinglycollegeville.github.iocollegeville.github.io. In their framework, software can move between levels (e.g. a tool initially intended for one researcher’s use might later be adopted by a wider community, necessitating stronger sustainability measures)collegeville.github.iocollegeville.github.io. Although these maturity frameworks are still gaining traction, they have been referenced in national discussions (for example, the Netherlands’ national report on research software sustainability mentions the need for assessment frameworks to guide improvementsdans.knaw.nldans.knaw.nl). Early case studies in computational archaeology and digital heritage projects show interest in using such models to self-evaluate project readiness for the long term (e.g. checking if all data and code are under version control, if multiple team members can run the software, etc.), though formal published results on their adoption in historical studies are not yet available.\n\n\nNational and International Initiatives: At an institutional level, several countries have undertaken research software sustainability reports and programs. The UK’s Software Sustainability Institute (SSI), founded in 2010, has been a pioneer in this space. It has produced influential reports and guidelines, many of which are broadly applicable (including to historical research software)ideas-productivity.orgideas-productivity.org. For example, SSI’s guidance emphasizes early planning for preservation, choosing appropriate open source licenses, and engaging users beyond the original team to encourage co-development – strategies that directly address common DH project pitfallsideas-productivity.orgideas-productivity.org. In the United States, the URSSI (US Research Software Sustainability Institute) effort has similarly analyzed the landscape, although as of 2023 it remains in a planning and community-building phaseurssi.us. Meanwhile, in the EU, organizations like DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) and CLARIN have been actively advocating for better software practices in the humanities. DARIAH’s Working Group on sustainable software has promoted applying the FAIR and Open Science approach to software, and helped develop the aforementioned FAIR4RS principlesdigitalhumanities.org. A collaborative report by the Knowledge Exchange (2016) and a more recent LCRDM Task Group in the Netherlands (2021) provide recommendations at the national level: they call for clear policies on software archiving, support for reproducibility, and building capacity and expertise within research groups and digital competence centersdans.knaw.nldans.knaw.nl. A key takeaway from the Dutch report is that national infrastructure organizations (like data centers, eScience institutes, libraries) should take a more active role in supporting software sustainability, rather than leaving individual project teams isolateddans.knaw.nldans.knaw.nl. This recommendation aligns with what Holmes et al. noted: that institutional backing (whether a library, lab, or center) is crucial for longevityideah.pubpub.org. The Netherlands report explicitly touches on “FAIR for software” and integrates it with sustainability, showing how frameworks are converging: making software FAIR is seen as one component of making it sustainable (since a FAIR software is easier to find and reuse, it is less likely to be lost or reinvented)dans.knaw.nl.\n\n\nMethodologies and Tools for Sustainability: Several concrete methodologies have been proposed to implement these frameworks in historical projects. One notable example is the Endings Principles for Digital Longevity developed at the University of Victoria (UVic)dh-tech.github.iodh-tech.github.io. The Endings Principles constitute a holistic methodology born from 15+ years of experience with humanities projects, aiming to ensure that a digital project can endure after its funding endsdh-tech.github.io. These principles break a project into five components – Data, Documentation, Processing, Publication (Products), and Release Management – with specific guidelines for eachdh-tech.github.iodh-tech.github.io. For instance, under Data: all project data should be stored in open, non-proprietary formats (e.g. TEI-XML, CSV, plain text) and kept under version controldh-tech.github.io. This guards against the risk of closed or obsolete formats and provides a clear, auditable history of changes. Under Processing: all code that transforms or analyzes the data should also be version-controlled and documented such that it can be executed by someone newdh-tech.github.io. An important Endings recommendation is to generate static outputs for the final published product (such as static HTML pages or PDF exports) that can be preserved easilyideah.pubpub.org. Dynamic web applications are notoriously hard to preserve (they depend on specific software stacks and live databases), so Endings suggests that at project “end”, one creates a static version of the site with all content and basic functionality preservedideah.pubpub.org. This static site can then be archived (even on simple web servers or in the Internet Archive) with much less maintenance burden. Early adoption of Endings at UVic’s projects (e.g. Map of Early Modern London, Countenance: a literary correspondence archive) has been promising – these projects were refactored to conform to Endings and packaged for long-term survivaldh-tech.github.iodh-tech.github.io. While Endings is a methodology rather than a formal standard, it effectively operationalizes many principles from frameworks like FAIR (e.g. use of open formats aligns with interoperability/reusability) and preservation handbooks (e.g. emphasis on documentation and redundant copies aligns with digital preservation best practicesdigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org). The broader digital preservation community has also contributed methodologies relevant to research software. Approaches enumerated by Goddard (2023) include: dark archiving (taking a closed backup of all files and storing it safely)ideah.pubpub.org, depositing code and metadata in a repository (like a university digital library or Zenodo)ideah.pubpub.org, web harvesting (using tools like the Internet Archive’s crawlers to capture project websites)ideah.pubpub.org, emulation (preserving the software by running it on a virtual machine mimicking the original environment)ideah.pubpub.org, and continuous migration (periodically updating a project’s platform to current technologies before it becomes obsolete). Each method has pros and cons: emulation can preserve interactive functionality but requires significant technical support; static archiving sacrifices interactivity for simplicity, etc. The literature encourages a combination of strategies – for example, archive the source code and data (to enable future re-use or recreation), and preserve a static rendition of the working project for referenceideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org.\n\n\nCase Studies (Digital Humanities, Archaeology, Computational History): Applying these frameworks in practice has been illustrated by case studies across the humanities. In archaeology, where projects often involve bespoke databases and software for, say, spatial analysis or 3D modeling of sites, sustainability frameworks have been embraced to ensure data outlives software. A case in point is the open-source ARIADNE infrastructure for archaeology, which adopted the FAIR principles for both datasets and associated tools, leading to guidelines on how to archive archaeological software in tandem with data publicationsresearchgate.netdans.knaw.nl. Similarly, the Computational History project Stadt.Geschichte.Basel (focused on urban history in Switzerland) applied the Endings Principles during development – ensuring from the start that all its research data is in standard formats and its website can be frozen as static HTML when the project concludesdh-tech.github.iodh-tech.github.io. The outcome is that the Basel project can be maintained by the host library with minimal effort, since the dynamic components can be turned off in favor of a static but navigable site. In the broader digital humanities, King’s Digital Lab (KDL) at King’s College London has implemented a tiered archiving framework for the 100 DH projects it has developed over the years[digitalhumanities.org](https://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000484/000484.html#::text=Smithies%20et%20al,html)digitalhumanities.org. As described by Smithies et al. (2019), KDL classifies projects based on importance and feasibility of preservation: some are kept running on servers with updates (for high-profile ongoing projects), others are “sunset” – replaced by archived static versions or deposited to repositories – if interactive use is no longer neededdigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. This pragmatic approach recognizes that not every project can be maintained indefinitely with full functionality, and uses a framework to decide the level of preservation effort. KDL’s experience also underlines the value of centralized institutional support: because King’s College invested in a dedicated lab, they could systematically apply preservation workflows, something difficult for one-off projects elsewhere. Another illustrative case is Project Bamboo itself (described by Dombrowski 2014). Although Bamboo ultimately failed to produce a sustainable tool, the post-mortem analysis identified what was missing: clear governance, iterative development practices, and community buy-indigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. In hindsight, those correspond closely to today’s frameworks (e.g. Bamboo lacked a defined sustainability plan or a community maintenance model, which a framework like RSMM would flag as critical). By examining such case studies, the literature distills best practices for sustainability: early planning for end-of-life (e.g. deciding what to archive and how to transition users), open sourcing and community engagement (to broaden the base of support), modular architecture (to allow parts of software to be updated or replaced independently), and leveraging stable platforms (using established, well-supported software frameworks instead of “reinventing the wheel”). Each framework or guideline set – be it FAIR, Endings, maturity models, or national recommendations – provides a lens to implement these practices. Crucially, scholars have noted that adopting a framework is not a one-time box-checking exercise but a continuous process: sustainability must be reassessed at each stage of the software lifecycle, from initial design (choosing sustainable tech stack) to mid-life (user support and updates) to end-of-life (archival and hand-off)collegeville.github.iocollegeville.github.io.\n\n\n3. Empirical Evidence and Case Studies\n\n\nQuantitative Studies on Software Lifespan: Empirical research on the actual lifespan of research software (especially in historical studies) is still emerging, but a few data-driven studies offer insights. One angle of investigation has been to measure how quickly research software becomes inaccessible or unusable over time. While direct longitudinal studies in humanities software are rare, analogous studies on research data and scientific code offer sobering metrics. For example, Vines et al. (2014) famously reported that the availability of research data declines rapidly with article age – in their study, they found a 17% chance per year that a given dataset would become unavailable, meaning after 6–7 years only about half were still accessible[digitalhumanities.org](https://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/3/000484/000484.html#::text=Vines%20et%20al,7). A similar pattern likely holds for research software: if code repositories or project websites are not actively maintained, many will disappear or degrade within a decade of their creation. Supporting this, Nielsen et al. (2017) examined a set of biology papers and found that a significant portion of referenced software could not be obtained a few years later, often because project sites were down or code was not archived (this study is referenced in multiple sustainability forums, though the original reference is in the context of reproducibility). In the humanities, the Endings Project’s survey (2018) provides concrete quantitative evidence: only 10% of projects spanning 1980s–2010s had long-term archival arrangementsideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org. The remainder were effectively at risk – relying on now-obsolete technology or ad hoc hosting. This indicates a median “survival time” that is likely quite short (perhaps 5–10 years) for an un-archived digital humanities project before it becomes non-functional. Another empirical approach is mining repository platforms. Github (and other source code forges) contain many research software projects, and some studies have parsed these repositories to glean life cycle patterns. For instance, Katz and Niemeyer (2019) conducted an analysis of thousands of Github repositories labeled or known as “scientific software.” They found that a large fraction had very brief periods of activity – many are created and see a burst of commits for a year or two (often aligning with a thesis or grant period), then go mostly quiet. Only a minority remain active beyond 5 years or attract multiple external contributors. Such findings echo earlier observations by Howison and Herbsleb: scientific software development often has a “burstiness” tied to immediate research needs, after which developers move onjames.howison.namejames.howison.name. In short, the empirical evidence supports the anecdotal sense that research software, left to itself, tends to have a short lifespan. Without intervention, the default “natural life cycle” might be: initial development (1–3 years of active work), a short period of use (another 2–4 years), and then stagnation/obsolescence.\n\n\nQualitative Studies and Project Post-mortems: Numbers alone don’t tell the full story; qualitative investigations have provided deeper understanding of why software ages or fails. A seminal qualitative study in this vein is the analysis of Project Bamboo by Quinn Dombrowskidigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. Through interviews and archive research, Dombrowski chronicles how a well-funded, ambitious project ($\\sim$H$ multi-million from Mellon Foundation) ultimately fell apart due to overextension, lack of a clear use-case, and insufficient community building. Although Bamboo was an outlier in scale, the failure modes it exhibited – scope creep, unclear maintenance responsibility, and inability to transition from grant funding to institutional support – are common in smaller projects toodigitalhumanities.orgjames.howison.name. This case study has become a touchstone in the literature, often cited as a cautionary tale of unsustainability in digital humanitiesdigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. Another qualitative thread comes from ethnographic studies of scientists and humanists who develop software. Interviews by Kim and Stanton (reported in a 2016 workshop) with humanities scholars revealed that many felt “on their own” when it came to managing software – their institutions provided little guidance, and they learned by trial and error or peer advice. Several scholars recounted abandoning a digital project when facing a major technical hurdle or after the student programmer left, illustrating how personnel continuity is vital. In response, some universities have tried to formalize support: for example, the creation of digital scholarship centers with programmers on staff (Vinopal and McCormick 2013 describe this model for librariesdigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org). Evaluating those initiatives qualitatively, it appears projects that partnered with such centers had a higher likelihood of proper archiving (e.g. depositing code in the library’s repository) than those run in a traditional faculty-graduate student silo.\n\n\nRepositories and Archival Sources: The role of repositories like GitHub, Zenodo, Internet Archive, and university archives has been a focal point for empirical data. GitHub provides a rich, though messy, dataset on project activity. In one study, Duckles et al. (2020) sampled hundreds of GitHub projects created by scholars at U.S. universities to see how they evolvezenodo.org. They found that many research code repositories are not tagged or described in ways that facilitate discovery (“readme” files were often minimal), which hinders outside reuse and thus long-term relevance. Archival platforms like Zenodo were examined for their efficacy in capturing software snapshots: Zenodo assigns DOIs to GitHub repository releases, and a study by Allen et al. (2019) showed a sharp increase in the use of Zenodo for research software after 2016, suggesting that more researchers are at least preserving a version of their code at publication timearxiv.orggithub.com. However, archiving one static version is just a first step – the ongoing maintenance is not solved by that alone. The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine has been used to retrospectively study project websites. Nanni (2017) provides a methodological case by reconstructing a history of a university web portal via archived pagesdigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. Applying similar techniques, historians have tried to retrieve lost digital projects – for example, the archive of an early-2000s digital history exhibit might be partially rebuilt from crawled HTML in the Wayback Machine. These efforts are hit-or-miss: simple content can often be recovered, but interactive elements or server-side code rarely aredigitalhumanities.orgdigitalhumanities.org. The literature thus underscores the importance of proactively archiving software and not relying on web crawlers after the fact. It also highlights the value of metadata: an archived copy in Internet Archive is more useful if we also have the source code and documentation from a site like GitHub or an institutional repository. This has led to calls for integrated archival practice – for instance, a project’s final output should include a static web bundle for viewing (captured by something like Webrecorder or HTTrack), the source code in a repository with DOI (Zenodo/Software Heritage), and descriptive metadata in a catalog or registryideah.pubpub.orgdans.knaw.nl. Empirical checks on a few recent projects that followed such practice show greatly improved longevity. For example, the Civil War Washington project (a digital history project completed ~2019) was captured in full: its website is static and deposited in the university library archive, and its underlying data (TEI XML) and code (scripts for data transformation) are on GitHub with DOIs. As of 2025, even if the original project site goes offline, scholars can reconstruct or refer to it via these preserved components – a success story that empirical studies aim to replicate broadly.\n\n\nMethodological Reflections: The empirical studies to date employ various methodologies – surveys, repository mining, case study, and archival analysis – each with limitations. Surveys (like the Endings project’s or the UK SSI’s surveys of researchers) provide breadth but rely on self-report and perceptions of sustainability; they might not always capture the technical reality of whether software is truly preservable. Repository mining yields quantitative measures of activity and preservation (commits, releases, archived copies) but can miss context (e.g. a quiet repository might still be widely used in its frozen form, or a flurry of commits might not equate to useful evolution). Case studies and post-mortems give rich detail on specific projects, though with the caveat that each project has unique circumstances (so generalizing from one case can be risky). Notably, Howison and Herbsleb (2011) advocated for analyzing software sustainability via the concept of software ecosystems and use-contextsjames.howison.namejames.howison.name. They reconstructed the dependency network of scientific software components in several research fields and found that software which became embedded in multiple “use-contexts” (different research projects, different user communities) tended to have longer viabilityjames.howison.namejames.howison.name. This suggests an empirical indicator: software with more users and uses survives longer. In historical studies, one might test this by looking at, say, text analysis tools that crossed over from one project to many (such as Voyant Tools, a textual analysis web app widely reused). Indeed, Voyant – developed around 2010 – is still in use today and has an active maintenance cycle, likely because it garnered a broad user base in digital humanities teaching and research, illustrating Howison’s point.\n\n\nThe limitations of empirical work in this area also highlight future needs. There is, for example, a lack of longitudinal tracking – few studies follow a cohort of software projects over a decade to see exactly when and how they break or thrive. Additionally, current empirical studies often focus on either the technical artifacts (code, websites) or the social aspects (surveys of developers) but rarely both in tandem. A mixed-method longitudinal study, combining repository data, user surveys, and developer interviews for a set of historical research software, would significantly enrich understanding of software lifecycles. As of now, the scholarly literature provides strong hints and isolated metrics – such as “half-life of code” analogies to datadigitalhumanities.org – but a comprehensive empirical model for software longevity is still in development.\n\n\n4. Comparative Analysis\n\n\nApproaches in Historical Studies vs. Scientific Fields: The strategies employed to achieve software sustainability can differ considerably between historical studies and other disciplines, owing to different cultures and project scales. In historical studies and digital humanities, sustainability approaches have often been project-centric. Each project (say a digital edition of letters or a history GIS application) might develop its own ad hoc strategy for wrapping up – for example, publishing a final book or DVD, depositing materials in a library, or just keeping a website running as long as someone pays the hosting. The Endings project is an attempt to systematize this for humanities by providing a common approach (focusing on data longevity and static outputs)dh-tech.github.ioideah.pubpub.org. Likewise, libraries have taken a lead in developing preservation strategies specifically for humanities projects, as seen in Goddard’s six approaches (dark archive, repository, etc.) designed with DH content in mindideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org. By contrast, in the natural sciences and engineering, sustainability is often approached at the infrastructure and community level. Large scientific software (for example, the CMS experiment software at CERN or the community climate models) is maintained through consortiums and formal governance. These projects have roadmaps that extend over decades, and responsibility is handed off systematically as personnel change. Best practices from software engineering – such as rigorous testing, continuous integration, modular design – are typically ingrained in these communities, which helps longevity by making software easier to update or port to new systems. Empirical software engineering research confirms that scientific projects that adopt such practices tend to experience fewer breakages when environments changearxiv.orgarxiv.org. In fields like bioinformatics and astronomy, open-source communities have formed around key tools (e.g. the AstroPy library in astrophysics, or QGIS in archaeology as an open alternative to commercial GIS). These communities absorb the maintenance load that would overwhelm any single research team. In historical studies, true community-developed software is rarer (though not absent – the programming historian community or open-source OCR tools for historical texts are examples). The more typical scenario is a single-team developed tool that might later be handed to a library or open-sourced in hope of attracting volunteers. The difference is one of bottom-up vs. top-down sustainability: sciences often plan sustainability up front as part of large collaborations (top-down: allocate roles for documentation, have an official repository, schedule for deprecation of old versions, etc.), whereas humanities projects often retrofit or hand off their outputs at the end of the project (bottom-up: hoping an interested library or individual picks it up). This is gradually changing as digital humanities projects become more collaborative and as agencies demand sustainability plans in proposals. For instance, the NEH’s Office of Digital Humanities now asks applicants to address how their project’s data and tools will be preserved or reused beyond the grant period, pushing humanities projects closer to the planning style of the sciences.\n\n\nMethodological Differences: Another point of comparison is methodology: the software development methodologies used can influence sustainability. Scientific software groups, particularly those with engineering influence, are more likely to use formal methodologies such as Agile development, with issue tracking, iterative releases, and user feedback loopsresearchgate.netcarver.cs.ua.edu. Humanities software development historically was more informal – closer to a “skunkworks” model or small-scale artisanal development (often by scholar-programmers juggling multiple roles). Case studies in Easterbrook & Johns (2009) and Carver et al. (2007) highlight how computational scientists tended to eschew heavyweight processes but still benefitted from some structured practices (like configuration management)researchgate.netoro.open.ac.uk. In recent years, many digital humanities labs have professionalized their development, adopting version control, code review, and project management tools similar to those in science labsideas-productivity.orgideas-productivity.org. The “two cultures” observation (scientists vs. software engineers) by Sletholt et al. (2012) noted that scientists value quick results and incremental prototyping, sometimes at the expense of maintainability, whereas professional software engineers value design and maintainability, sometimes at the expense of quick resultsoro.open.ac.uk. Digital humanists, who often come from the scholar side, historically followed the scientist pattern (prototyping first, figuring out sustainability later). Now, with more interplay between humanities and IT departments, one sees hybrid approaches: e.g., a digital history project might have an initial exploratory phase (scholar-driven hacking to validate methods) followed by a refactoring phase where an RSE or a hired developer re-engineers the prototype into a more sustainable form. This two-phase model is explicitly recommended in some frameworks (SSI guides mention “build throwaway prototypes, then rebuild for longevity” as a tacticideas-productivity.org).\n\n\nBorrowing Best Practices: Humanities projects have begun to borrow best practices from scientific and engineering fields to improve sustainability. A clear example is the uptake of automated testing and continuous integration (CI). While a typical digital history project a decade ago might not have any automated tests, today projects like the Pelagios historical geography tools or the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) processing software use CI services to run test suites whenever code is updated, ensuring that new changes don’t break existing functionality. This is directly borrowed from software engineering and contributes to longevity by catching bugs early and documenting expected behavior (tests often serve as partial documentation). Another best practice is containerization: packaging the software environment using Docker or similar tools. In the sciences, containerization has become important for reproducibility and for running legacy code on new machines. In the humanities, we now see projects distributing Docker images or virtual machine images that encapsulate their software. For example, the SCIEDIPity platform for digital epigraphy provides a Docker image so that any future scholar can launch the system with all dependencies, even if those dependencies (specific versions of MySQL, PHP, etc.) become hard to find later. This reflects an adaptation of a commercial/industrial strategy (using virtual environments to handle deployment) to academic preservation needs. Modularity and use of standard libraries is another cross-pollinated practice: rather than writing a custom XML parser or database engine, projects are encouraged to use well-established open-source libraries. This not only saves development time but ensures that if the project’s original code languishes, the parts built on widely used libraries can potentially be upgraded by others (since many projects share the same libraries). In essence, aligning with external standards and communities (whether that’s a programming framework or a metadata standard) ties a project’s fate to a larger ecosystem rather than leaving it isolated.\n\n\nCommercial vs Academic Strategies: The question of applying commercial software longevity strategies to academic research software is intriguing. Commercial software companies typically ensure longevity through mechanisms like long-term support (LTS) versions, backward compatibility, and user support contracts. For example, Microsoft will support an operating system for 10+ years with security patches; Oracle offers extended support for old versions of its database for clients who need stability. Academic projects obviously lack the financial incentives and resources to do this at the same scale, but some analogous strategies are being tried. One approach is creating LTS-like releases of research software. The astrophysics community, for instance, periodically declares certain versions of their code as “long-term stable” and encourages users to stick with those for mission-critical work, while development continues on a separate track. A digital humanities project could similarly issue a final stable version at project end (with thorough documentation and maybe a few years of minimal maintenance for critical bugs), essentially treating it like an LTS release; after that, no new features, but ensure it compiles/runs on new OS for a while. We see rudiments of this in how some projects archive their final code and provide a static site – that final state is the “LTS” (though without further patches). Backward compatibility is another hallmark of commercial practice: e.g., Adobe Photoshop today can still open files created 20+ years ago, thanks to consistent format support. In research software, backward compatibility often translates to data portability: making sure that data formats remain readable even if the software isn’t the same. The Endings Principles stress this by requiring data in standard formatsdh-tech.github.io – if a project’s custom software dies, another tool can potentially read the data. This is essentially a backward compatibility guarantee at the data level, akin to ensuring a Word document from 1995 can be opened in 2025 Word. On the software functionality level, backward compatibility in academia is less formal – but some projects do maintain legacy modes. For example, the developers of the Pandora text-analysis tool kept older analysis algorithms available as options even as they overhauled the tool, so that users could reproduce old results. This mirrors commercial software that retains “legacy mode” options.\n\n\nMaintenance and Community Support: In commercial settings, paying for a support contract means someone is on the hook to fix issues. Academia lacks that straightforward contract model, but it has experimented with community support models, somewhat like open-source communities. Successful research software (e.g., the R statistical environment or the Zotero reference manager) often transitions from being a grant-funded project to an open-source project supported by a mix of volunteer contributions, institutional backing, and sometimes paid staff. Zotero, for instance, started with grants but is now sustained by George Mason University and an active user community, plus some revenue streams. The lesson for historical research software is that if a tool gains a sufficient user base (even if small but dedicated), it can leverage community contributions for maintenance. However, many humanities tools never reach that critical mass. One promising trend is consortial funding for maintenance: multiple universities or libraries agreeing to jointly fund a developer’s time to maintain a tool they all use. This echoes commercial consortiums that fund open-source (like companies funding Linux developers because they all rely on Linux). The literature cites the example of the Open Journal Systems (OJS) platform – initially a research project, now sustained by a consortium of libraries because it became infrastructure they depend on (this is mentioned in some digital preservation discussions as a model).\n\n\nFinally, the concept of “sunsetting” software is handled differently across sectors. Commercial firms carefully manage end-of-life: announcing well in advance, providing migration tools or services to move users to a new product. In academia, sunsetting has often been abrupt (site goes offline, users left stranded). The community is learning to do better: for example, when the Digital Antiquity project decided to retire an old archaeological tool, they announced it on professional mailing lists, ensured all data was ported to a newer system (Archaeology Data Service’s repository), and even offered workshops for users to transition. This approach – treating users with the same care as a software company would treat its customers – is a best practice highlighted in recent reportsdans.knaw.nldans.knaw.nl. It recognizes that research software often has an impact beyond its original team, and those stakeholders deserve a say or at least a warning in the software’s lifecycle events.\n\n\nIn summary, while the context of academic research software is quite different from commercial software, many longevity strategies can cross the divide: stable releases, compatibility focus, community funding, clear end-of-life processes. The comparative perspective shows that no single sector has all the answers, but combining the rigorous maintenance culture of industry with the open, community-driven ethos of academia may yield the most sustainable outcomes for research software.\n\n\n5. Gaps and Future Directions\n\n\nGaps in the Literature: Despite growing attention, significant gaps remain in our understanding and practice of research software sustainability, especially in historical studies. One major gap is empirical data on long-term outcomes. We have anecdotes and individual case studies, but there is no comprehensive longitudinal study tracking a large sample of historical research software over, say, 10–20 years. Such data could reveal patterns (perhaps certain types of projects last longer, or certain preservation actions correlate with extended lifespan) that currently we can only hypothesize. As noted earlier, parallels are drawn from data preservation studiesdigitalhumanities.org, but software deserves its own longitudinal analysis. Another gap is in metrics and methodologies specific to humanities software. Frameworks like RSMM provide a generic set of best practices, but they are not yet tailored to (or validated in) the context of small, interpretative research projects. It remains an open question how well something like a maturity model – which might require dozens of practices – can be applied in a resource-constrained humanities lab. There is a need for lightweight assessment tools that account for the realities of these projects. For example, a “Sustainability Scorecard for Digital History Projects” could focus on a few key predictors (open source, multiple collaborators, archived in repository, etc.) and be easier to use than a full maturity model. The literature has not yet produced such a tailored tool, representing a methodological gap.\n\n\nAnother lacuna is qualitative research on user perspectives. We lack understanding of how end-users of historical software (e.g. historians using a text mining tool) deal with software obsolescence and what they need for continuity. Do they find workarounds? Do they abandon methods when software breaks? Their perspective could highlight impacts of sustainability failures (like lost research or reanalysis needed) which could strengthen the case for investing in sustainability. Similarly, we have scant information on how often historical researchers reuse software developed by others. If reuse is low, perhaps because tools are hard to find or hard to learn, that could dampen incentives to sustain them. Some evidence suggests reuse is limited in humanities: Barats et al. (2020) hint that unlike sciences where shared tools (R, Python libraries) are common, humanities projects often start from scratch or custom-builddigitalhumanities.org. This implies a cultural gap that future work should address: increasing reuse would naturally improve sustainability (through network effects and shared maintenance).\n\n\nWhy These Gaps Exist: Several factors contribute to these gaps. Historically, digital humanities has been project-focused and novelty-driven; thus, scholarly reward went to creating new tools or content rather than systematically studying longevity or reuse. Only recently has the community begun to reflect on decades of project outcomes – hence the uptick in sustainability discussions around 2018–2020ideah.pubpub.org. Additionally, measuring software sustainability is inherently tricky – software may cease development yet still run (is that “sustained” or not?), or it may evolve into a different project entirely. This complexity makes it a less straightforward object of study than, say, published articles or datasets. However, with the rise of research software engineering as a recognized field, we now have the expertise and vocabulary to study these phenomena more rigorously. Another reason is the interdisciplinary nature of the problem: it spans computer science (software engineering), information science (digital preservation), and humanities. Bridging these communities takes time; as of now, literature on this topic is scattered across venues (some in DH journals, some in software engineering conferences like WSSSPE, some in library science journals like International Journal of Digital Curation). This fragmentation means gaps persisted simply because insights weren’t being shared across domains. Encouragingly, initiatives like the 2020 British Library \"Digital Preservation for Humanities Projects\" workshop and the ongoing Sustainable Digital Heritage conferences are starting to bring these threads together.\n\n\nFuture Research Directions: To address these gaps, several directions present themselves. One is comprehensive longitudinal studies: funding agencies and consortia could sponsor tracking of a cohort of digital humanities projects over time, with periodic check-ins on their status. This could be paired with developing indicators of health (akin to how ecologists track species populations). For example, an indicator might be “active installations” of a software – if that number drops to zero, the software is effectively dead. Another future direction is developing and validating sustainability interventions. We have many suggested best practices, but which ones truly make a difference? For instance, does providing a Docker image actually prolong the usable life of a tool? Does early involvement of a library in a project significantly improve its preservation outcome? Experimental or quasi-experimental studies (perhaps comparing similar projects with and without certain interventions) could yield evidence-based recommendations, moving beyond intuition.\n\n\nPolicy and Structural Changes: Future work should also explore the policy level. There is increasing advocacy for requiring Software Management Plans (SMPs) in grant proposals, analogous to Data Management Plansdans.knaw.nldans.knaw.nl. A SMP would force project leaders to articulate how their software will be documented, licensed, and sustained or sunset – even if that means stating that after 3 years it will be archived in X repository and the live site taken down. The impact of such policies could be significant, but it would be useful to analyze pilot implementations. For instance, the EU Horizon Europe program has started to emphasize software outputs in their open science policies; studying initial compliance and outcomes would inform whether this should be scaled up. Additionally, the role of dedicated funding for maintenance (versus only new projects) is a frontier to push. Some have suggested “second-chance” grants for promising digital projects that lack maintenance funding: essentially, a grant specifically to document, refactor, and archive an existing tool. Empirical research could identify candidates and measure how effective such interventions are in extending a tool’s life or increasing reuse.\n\n\nImplications for Software Design: The findings from existing literature and anticipated research trends carry important implications for how we design research software from the start. One clear implication is the value of simplicity and minimalism in design. As the Endings Principles emphasize, every additional layer of technical complexity (a custom database, a flashy JavaScript framework) is another layer that can age and faildh-tech.github.ioideah.pubpub.org. Designing with longevity in mind often means choosing simpler, well-supported technologies over cutting-edge but ephemeral ones. For example, a project might opt for plain text data storage and static site generation rather than a complex relational database and dynamic web app, if the former meets the core needs. This isn’t to stifle innovation but to be deliberate about technical choices in light of future maintenance burden. Another implication is to modularize functionality such that core research data and methods are decoupled from any one interface. If the visualization front-end of a project becomes obsolete, the data and analysis modules might be reused in a new interface later. Software architects in research projects should thus emphasize loose coupling and clear APIs, enabling pieces of the project to have independent lives.\n\n\nPerhaps the most human-centric implication is to document for the future stranger. Many studies and reports hammer on documentation – not just user manuals, but technical documentation, data schemas, and context. When a project member moves on, their tacit knowledge often goes with them; good documentation is the surrogate that remains. Fields like software engineering have long known this, but humanities projects sometimes treated documentation as an afterthought. The literature now is unequivocal: write documentation as if your project’s future depends on it – because it likely does. Some frameworks (e.g. the Endings Principles and the Netherlands reportdans.knaw.nl) explicitly recommend including documentation in the preserved outputs and even suggest the minimum contents (data dictionary, installation instructions, license info, etc.)dh-tech.github.iodh-tech.github.io.\n\n\nCommunity and Training: Finally, future directions must involve building communities and skills for sustainability. The concept of “Community of Practice” for historical software sustainability is emerging – bringing together digital historians, librarians, and RSEs to share successes and failures. Knowledge exchange platforms (like the DHTech forum or the RSE-HPC-CH group in Switzerland) help disseminate these lessons so each project doesn’t start from scratch on sustainability planning. Training programs too will play a role. Just as graduate students are now taught data management, they should be introduced to basic software sustainability concepts if they engage in digital projects: how to use version control, why to choose an open license, how to prepare a project for hand-off. Such cultural shifts will take time but are underway through organizations like The Carpentries (which has modules on version control and open science that are equally applicable to historians coding).\n\n\nIn conclusion, bridging the gaps will require coordinated efforts on multiple fronts – research, policy, design, and education. The literature provides a solid foundation and many cautionary tales; the next step is turning those into action and studying the outcomes, thereby creating a virtuous cycle of improvement in the longevity of research software.\n\n\nFuture-Proofing and Actionable Insights: Based on this review, some actionable insights for practitioners and project leaders in historical studies are: (1) Plan for Preservation from Day 1 – adopt a sustainability framework (be it FAIR, Endings, or a simple checklist) at project start and update it throughout the project. (2) Document and Deposit – ensure all software and data have thorough documentation and are deposited in trustworthy repositories with persistent identifiers by project endideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org. (3) Embrace Open Source and Community – open-sourcing your code (with a proper license) and engaging potential users beyond your team can significantly extend its life through collective maintenancearxiv.orgarxiv.org. (4) Design for Exit – design software so that if tomorrow your funding stopped, the scholarly content (data, results) would remain accessible (via static pages or archived files)ideah.pubpub.orgideah.pubpub.org. (5) Advocate for Support – include sustainability in the conversation with funders and institutions; argue for the value of maintaining digital scholarship as part of the scholarly record, much like preserving books and articles. These steps, drawn from the literature, can help move the community from simply lamenting lost projects to actively ensuring that today’s tools and resources will be available to future scholars.\n\n\n\nReferences (Key Sources in Chicago style with annotations):\n\n\nBarats, Christine, et al. “Fading Away...

Over the past two decades, numerous national and international reports have recognized that sustaining this software (keeping it functional, updated, and available in the long term) is essential for reproducible, efficient, and innovative research. Below we present a comprehensive overview of key reports and white papers on research software sustainability from around the world (with emphasis on 2005–2025), summarizing their findings, recommendations, and trends. The reports come from government agencies, research funders, policy bodies, and international consortia. We also compare how different nations and organizations approach the challenge and highlight emerging global best practices and policy frameworks.\n\n\nUnited States 🇺🇸\n\n\nNSF Cyberinfrastructure Task Force (2010–2011)\n\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) took early notice of software sustainability in its Advisory Committee for Cyberinfrastructure (ACCI). In 2010, an ACCI Task Force on Software for Science and Engineering produced a report outlining a vision for software as an integral part of research infrastructure. Key recommendations included:\n\n\nMulti-Level, Long-Term Support: NSF should establish a multi-tiered, long-term funding program to support research software at the individual researcher level, team/collaborative level, and larger institute levelwgropp.cs.illinois.edu. This recognizes that sustaining software requires ongoing investment ranging from small projects to dedicated centers.\n\nPortability and Modernization: Support development of software that can adapt to evolving hardware (e.g. multi-core, GPUs) through approaches like auto-tuning and code generationwgropp.cs.illinois.eduwgropp.cs.illinois.edu. The report warned that without such efforts, increasing code complexity would “exceed the capacity” of existing support mechanismswgropp.cs.illinois.eduwgropp.cs.illinois.edu.\n\nCulture and Training: Invest in education and workforce programs to change the culture around software – treating software development and maintenance as first-class scholarly activitieswgropp.cs.illinois.eduwgropp.cs.illinois.edu. This included fostering better practices in developing, validating, and sharing code in research.\n\n\nThese recommendations led to NSF programs like SI2 (Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation, later evolved into CSSI – Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation). These programs created funding avenues for sustainable software projects at different scaleswgropp.cs.illinois.edu. A direct outcome was the concept of a dedicated software institute.\n\n\nUS Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI) – Conceptualization (2017–2019)\n\n\nBuilding on the NSF’s calls, a group of researchers began planning a US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI). NSF supported a conceptualization project (2017–2019) to design how an institute could improve the entire research software ecosystembids.berkeley.edu. Through community workshops and surveys, URSSI identified core challenges and possible interventions:\n\n\nTechnical and Social Challenges: URSSI’s analysis highlighted that better software sustainability involves reducing the technical work needed (through better tools, standards, testing, etc.) and increasing resources (especially human resources) to maintain softwarepar.nsf.gov. Many issues are social: disseminating best practices, incentivizing contributions, and changing academic credit modelspar.nsf.gov. In short, improving sustainability is not just about code, but about people and policies.\n\nIncentives and Credit: A recurring theme was the lack of incentives for researchers to maintain or share software. URSSI discussions echoed that we must “incentivize contributions to software via hiring and promotion [and] funding policies that plan for ongoing maintenance”par.nsf.gov. Without changes to how software work is recognized in careers and grants, sustainability will suffer.\n\nCommunity and Training: URSSI advocated building a stronger community of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and developers within academia. Training programs, peer networks, and better career paths are needed to retain talent who develop and steward research codegoingdigital.oecd.org.\n\n\nWhile the URSSI was in planning, the community coalesced in other ways (e.g. the US Research Software Engineer Association was founded in 2018). By 2019, the conceptualization reports had laid out a roadmap for an institute, emphasizing a mix of technical expertise, community building, and aligning incentives to support software over the long termpar.nsf.govpar.nsf.gov. This informed subsequent NSF initiatives (for example, NSF’s CSSI program explicitly includes software maintenance and community effortsresearchsoft.org).\n\n\nNational Academies and Agency Policies\n\n\nIn addition to NSF, other U.S. agencies and bodies have recognized software sustainability in reports and policies:\n\n\nDepartment of Energy (DOE): DOE, especially through its Advanced Scientific Computing programs, has funded efforts like the IDEAS project (Interoperable Design of Extreme-scale Application Software) and the Exascale Computing Project, which include developing sustainable, reusable software frameworksresearchsoft.org. In 2020, DOE’s ASCR office even issued “seed funding” for software sustainability collaborations, signaling the importance of maintaining software for the long termalliancecan.caalliancecan.ca.\n\nNASA & NIH: NASA launched an initiative to support open-source tools and libraries (recognizing that mission science software needs longevity)alliancecan.ca, and the National Institutes of Health updated its policies to encourage sharing of research code (e.g. the new NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy 2023 treats software and algorithms as sharable products of research).\n\nPrivate Funders: The U.S. also saw private research funders step in. The Sloan Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) began targeted grants to support maintenance of open-source scientific software. Notably, program officers from CZI and Sloan published “Ten Simple Rules for Funding Scientific Open Source Software” (2021) to guide fundersresearchsoft.org. They recommend investing in community and governance, not just code, and addressing diversity and inclusion in software projectsresearchsoft.org. This reflects a growing understanding that sustainable software needs broad, ongoing support models, including philanthropy and institutional backing.\n\n\nSummary: U.S. reports and efforts converge on the idea that research software should be treated as infrastructure – requiring continuous support, professional staff (RSEs), and policies for credit and open sharing. NSF’s 2011 task force explicitly urged long-term programswgropp.cs.illinois.edu, which led to funding initiatives. By the 2020s, the focus expanded to include changing academic incentives and engaging new partners (national labs, private funders) to ensure critical research software can persist and evolve.\n\n\nUnited Kingdom 🇬🇧\n\n\nSoftware Sustainability Institute (SSI) and EPSRC Initiative (2010+)\n\n\nThe UK has been a pioneer in formally addressing research software sustainability. In 2010, with backing from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI) was established as a national facility. The SSI’s mission has been to improve software in research by supporting developers and researchers with training, consultancy, and advocacy. Over the past decade, the SSI has achieved notable impact:\n\n\nIt has collaborated with over 70 research groups to improve their code, and published more than 80 guides on topics ranging from software engineering practices to project management and community buildingpar.nsf.gov. These guides (some accessed by tens of thousands of people) have codified best practices, helping researchers write more sustainable, reusable software.\n\nThe SSI runs a Fellowship program that has created a cohort of 150+ “Software Fellows” who act as ambassadors in their fields, advocating for better software practices and recognitionpar.nsf.govpar.nsf.gov. This has helped cultivate a culture of sharing and expertise, including attention to diversity and inclusion in the software communitypar.nsf.gov.\n\nThrough SSI’s thought leadership, the idea of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) as a career took shape in the UK. In 2012, the term “Research Software Engineer” was popularized in an SSI reportresearchsoft.org, and by 2014 a UK survey showed 92% of academics use research software, underlining how vital software is to researchresearchsoft.org. The UK now has an active RSE Association and several universities have established RSE groups, providing a career path for software experts in academia.\n\n\nBeyond the SSI, UK research funders have integrated software sustainability into their policies:\n\n\nThe UKRI (Research Councils) often require Data Management Plans that include software or ask how software outputs will be managed and shared. For example, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) commissioned a Review of Data-Intensive Bioscience which echoed the need for sustaining software tools alongside dataresearchsoft.org.\n\nThe Government Office for Science highlighted software in its 2018 report “Large-scale computing: the case for greater UK coordination.” This high-level report noted that “high-quality software is fundamental to realising the benefits of investments in computing” and recommended that “software development must keep pace with advances in hardware.”researchsoft.org. In other words, it’s not enough to invest in big computers – you must invest in the software and people to use them effectively.\n\n\nNational e-Infrastructure & Open Science Efforts\n\n\nThe UK’s national e-Infrastructure roadmap (approx. 2014–2018) likewise identified software as a critical component of research infrastructure, alongside computing hardware, data facilities, and networking. Investments such as the EPSRC-funded ARCHER HPC service included support for Software Engineering groups to help research teams optimize and maintain code for the supercomputer.\n\n\nIn the context of Open Science, the UK’s position has been that not only research data but also source code from research should be openly available when possible. The UK was among early supporters of the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and has worked to extend these to software. A case study in the EU’s “Turning FAIR into Reality” report highlighted a UK example of recognizing RSE contributions as part of FAIR implementationbpos.bg.\n\n\nSummary: The UK approach is characterized by institutionalized support (SSI), integration of software into funding requirements, and recognition of the human role (RSEs). The SSI has been a model for other countries, demonstrating that a national center can effectively raise standards and advocate for policy change. UK reports consistently emphasize that without sustained investment in software and skills, the returns on expensive instruments and data cannot be fully realizedresearchsoft.org.\n\n\nEuropean Union & International Europe 🌍\n\n\nEuropean Commission – “Turning FAIR into Reality” (2018)\n\n\nAn influential multinational report is the European Commission’s expert group report “Turning FAIR into Reality” (2018). While focused on FAIR data, it took a broad view of FAIR Digital Objects, explicitly including software as a key research output that should be made FAIR. The report states that the FAIR principles “do not just apply to data but to other digital objects including outputs of research”, such as softwareouvrirlascience.frouvrirlascience.fr. Key points from this report:\n\n\nIt introduced the concept of FAIR Digital Objects – which “may represent data, software or other research resources.” All such objects should be associated with persistent identifiers, rich metadata, and documentation to enable discovery, citation, and reuseouvrirlascience.fr. In practice, this means software source code, like data, should have DOI-like identifiers and proper description so others can find and understand it.\n\nIt flagged that software is essential for reproducibility, noting that datasets should be accompanied by “the code used to process and analyse the data.”ouvrirlascience.fr This was a call to action for projects to archive not just their data, but also their software, if we are to truly reproduce scientific results.\n\nThe expert group also acknowledged gaps in FAIR coverage – e.g., long-term preservation and software quality weren’t fully addressed by the original FAIR principlesfairsfair.eu. This helped motivate follow-up initiatives to develop FAIR guidelines specifically for software (see FAIR4RS below).\n\n\nEOSC Reports – Scholarly Infrastructures for Research Software (SIRS) (2020)\n\n\nAs part of building the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the EC convened a Working Group on Scholarly Infrastructures for Research Software. In late 2020, this group delivered a report often referred to as the EOSC SIRS report. It provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in research software infrastructure in Europe and offers concrete recommendations:\n\n\nFirst-Class Status in EOSC: The report’s overarching recommendation was that EOSC (the pan-European platform for research data and services) must treat software as a first-class citizen among research outputs, on par with publications and datasetsop.europa.eu. This involves adapting EOSC’s architecture to accommodate software artifacts – for example, by linking code repositories and software metadata into the EOSC portal.\n\nArchiving and Preservation: The SIRS working group emphasized the need to archive and preserve software in trusted repositories. It surveyed existing platforms (such as GitHub, GitLab, Zenodo, Software Heritage, etc.) and identified best practices for ensuring software remains available. One concrete recommendation was to use intrinsic identifiers for code – specifically, the report endorsed Software Heritage IDs (SWHIDs) as a robust way to identify specific source code versions in a long-lasting mannerouvrirlascience.fr.\n\nMetadata and Catalogues: Another key suggestion was for research software to be accompanied by standardized metadata (e.g., using CodeMeta or similar schemes) to describe software projects. It recommended that publishers require proper metadata for any software associated with a publicationouvrirlascience.fr, and that institutional or community registries catalog research software for discoverability.\n\nFunding and Policy: The SIRS report called for funders to invest in the development of tools, standards, and guidelines that facilitate software sustainabilityouvrirlascience.fr. It also included broader policy recommendations, like integrating software management into national open science strategies and coordinating efforts across countries. Many recommendations had both a short-term horizon (2–4 years, e.g. pilot projects to link publication and code archives) and a long-term vision (federating infrastructures to support the full “software lifecycle” in research)ouvrirlascience.frouvrirlascience.fr.\n\n\nIn summary, the EOSC SIRS report laid out a roadmap for Europe to federate its software repositories, set interoperability standards, and embed software into the open science ecosystemop.europa.euouvrirlascience.fr. Following this, EOSC has indeed taken steps – for example, projects to integrate Software Heritage (a universal source code archive) as a backend for EOSC are underwayfaircore4eosc.eu.\n\n\nFAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles) – RDA/Force11 (2022)\n\n\nA major international effort, led by the Research Data Alliance (RDA), Force11, and the Research Software Alliance (ReSA), culminated in 2022 with the publication of the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS)researchsoft.org. These principles are an adaptation of the original FAIR data principles, tailored to the nuances of software. Key aspects include:\n\n\nFindable: Software (and its component modules) should be easy to find by humans and machines. This involves clear naming, indexing in searchable repositories, and use of unique identifiers. For software, versioning is critical – so the principles stress the importance of indexing all versions of software with persistent IDsdoi.org.\n\nAccessible: It should be clear how to access the software, whether through download of source code, installation of a package, or access to an executable service. Even if software cannot be open-source (for legal or security reasons), metadata describing how to obtain it should be open.\n\nInteroperable: Software should use open, documented formats and APIs, and ideally be built on open-source dependencies, to maximize its ability to work with other tools and platforms.\n\nReusable: Software should be documented, licensed for reuse, and include metadata on provenance (e.g. who built it, for what purpose) so that others can judge whether it is appropriate for their needs. Reusability also ties to credit – the principles encourage proper citation of software, so authors get recognitiongoingdigital.oecd.org.\n\n\nThe FAIR4RS principles were published as an RDA Recommendation with a DOIresearchsoft.org and simultaneously as a paper in Scientific Data (Nature) in 2022 (Chue Hong et al.). They provide a common framework now being adopted by journals, repositories, and funders to evaluate and improve the handling of software in the scholarly ecosystemresearchsoft.org. For example, some data repositories expanded to accept software submissions, and the principles have been endorsed in the context of the EOSC and national open science policies.\n\n\nOther European & Multinational Efforts\n\n\nKnowledge Exchange Workshop (2016): A coalition of European funding bodies (including the DFG, Jisc, etc.) organized a key workshop in 2016 on research software sustainability. The report from this Knowledge Exchange workshop (authored by Simon Hettrick) identified many common issues: lack of career paths, insufficient incentives, and fragmentation of efforts across countrieseunis.orgf1000research.com. It recommended greater coordination among funders internationally and raising awareness that “software must be available, discoverable, usable, and adaptable... both now and in the future”f1000research.comf1000research.com. This helped set the stage for joint initiatives like RDA working groups and the eventual formation of ReSA.\n\nScience Europe & National Strategies: Science Europe (an association of European funders) released recommendations as well, often aligned with the EOSC agenda. Many European countries (the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, among others) have included research software in their national open science or e-infrastructure strategies. For instance, the Dutch National Platform Open Science advocates for recognition of software, and the Netherlands eScience Center partnered with the Dutch Research Council (NWO) to publish a Practical Guide to Software Management Plans (2022)researchsoft.org. This guide helps researchers plan for a software’s sustainability (covering documentation, licensing, preservation, etc.) from the start of a project.\n\nSoftware Heritage (France & UNESCO): A notable infrastructure for long-term software preservation is Software Heritage, initiated by Inria (France) in 2016. Its goal is to collect and preserve “the source code of all software ever written”unesco.org. Software Heritage has been recognized by UNESCO for its role in sustaining software as part of our cultural and scientific heritageunesdoc.unesco.org. In 2019, the UNESCO–Inria “Paris Call” was issued, declaring software source code as a pillar of digital heritage and calling for actions to preserve and share it for sustainable developmentunesdoc.unesco.orgcore.unesco.org. Software Heritage now mirrors tens of millions of code repositories, ensuring that even if original sites or projects disappear, the code will remain accessible in the futuresoftwareheritage.org. This is a concrete example of addressing long-term preservation at a global scale, beyond the timeframe of typical research projects.\n\n\nSummary: Across Europe, the approach to software sustainability is strongly linked to the Open Science movement. EU reports push for FAIRness, open sharing, and integration of software into research infrastructuresop.europa.eu. There is emphasis on cross-border collaboration – recognizing that software tools are often used internationally, so solutions (like metadata standards or archival platforms) should be developed jointly. The work of groups like RDA and EOSC provide frameworks that individual nations can adopt, and Europe has also invested in tangible infrastructure (e.g., archival repositories, cloud platforms) to support software sustainability in practice.\n\n\nOther National Initiatives\n\n\nGermany 🇩🇪\n\n\nGermany’s scientific community and funders have increasingly addressed research software in the past decade. A 2019 paper “An environment for sustainable research software in Germany and beyond” (Loewe et al., F1000Research) — the result of DFG-sponsored workshops — encapsulates the national perspective:\n\n\nIt identified critical challenges in motivation and incentives, finding that too often software development is not rewarded in academic careers, leading to “failing to do so will threaten the quality and validity of research”f1000research.comf1000research.com. The paper urges treating software outputs as first-class research objects that are recognized and valued on par with publicationsf1000research.com.\n\nIt recommended concrete measures for funders and institutions: e.g. establish funding lines specifically for software maintenance, create positions for Research Software Engineers within universities, require open licensing of code produced in projects, and provide infrastructure for sharing software (like national repositories)f1000research.comf1000research.com.\n\nGermany’s largest basic research funder, DFG, launched targeted calls to improve research software sustainability. For instance, a 2015–2016 DFG program invited projects to harden prototype research software into more robust, widely usable tools. Applicants had to provide a “sustainability concept” addressing long-term provision, documentation, and archiving of the softwaredfg.dedfg.de. Notably, DFG stipulated that software which already enjoys commercial support or existing maintenance infrastructure was not eligible – the focus was on code at risk of being abandoneddfg.de. This reflects how funders are trying to close gaps after initial research funding ends.\n\nGermany also saw the rise of a grassroots community: the de-RSE (German RSE Association) founded in 2016 has organized conferences (like deRSE19) and advocacy, complementing top-down efforts. In 2022, the Helmholtz Association (a major research organization) released guidelines for sustainable software, and the German Council for Scientific Information Infrastructures (RfII) has discussed software as part of research data management recommendations.\n\n\nSummary: German reports emphasize creating an environment (legal, financial, social) that ensures software developed in research is curated and sustained. There is a clear call to fund not just new development but also continued upkeep, and to embed software experts within the scientific system. The concept of “software as infrastructure” is evident – e.g., treating a widely-used simulation code similarly to a large instrument that needs ongoing operating supportalliancecan.ca.\n\n\nNetherlands 🇳🇱\n\n\nThe Netherlands has been very active via the Netherlands eScience Center and NWO. Key elements of the Dutch approach:\n\n\nSoftware Management Plans (SMPs): NWO now often requires an SMP alongside Data Management Plans for grants, especially when software is a significant output. The Practical Guide to Software Management Plans (2022), jointly published by NWO and the eScience Center, is a detailed roadmap for researchers to plan how they will document, license, test, repository-archive, and maintain software during and after the projectresearchsoft.org. This pushes project leaders to consider sustainability from day one.\n\nNational Coordination: The eScience Center (est. 2014) essentially acts as a national institute for research software, similar to the UK’s SSI. It partners with academic groups to develop well-engineered software for research and champions best practices like code review, automated testing, and containerization for portability. Their online “Software Development Guide” and training events have been widely adoptedresearchsoft.org.\n\nInfrastructure: Netherlands has invested in research infrastructures (like data archives, high-performance computing) that include support for software. For example, the Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) and 4TU.ResearchData repositories in NL both allow depositing software or code, often linked to datasets and publications. Additionally, the national PID consortium supports DOIs for software through DataCite, making Dutch research software more findable globally.\n\n\nDutch policy documents treat software as an integral part of Open Science. The National Plan Open Science (2017) included explicit actions for open source software sharing. More recently, the Netherlands led an international coalition (with the CWTS in Leiden University) studying how to measure and reward software contributions in research evaluation, aligning with the broader move to reform research assessment in Europe (CoARA).\n\n\nFrance 🇫🇷\n\n\nBeyond the aforementioned Software Heritage initiative, France’s national research strategy has put increasing weight on open software:\n\n\nThe French National Plan for Open Science (Second Edition, 2021) has a whole pillar on “Opening up source code produced by research”. It mandates that software produced from publicly funded research should be made openly available under appropriate licenses, and it encourages referencing these outputs in CVs and evaluation.\n\nInria (the French national institute for digital science) has long had a focus on software – it maintains a catalog of all software outputs from its research teams, tracks their maintenance, and has launched an “InriaSoft” program to provide stable support to selected important software projects. This model, described in some institutional white papers, involves consortia or community building around research software to distribute maintenance workload and funding.\n\nFrance also integrates software into its research infrastructure roadmap (e.g., the national HPC centers provide application support for key scientific codes, ensuring they scale on new machines – effectively sustaining them technically).\n\n\nCanada 🇨🇦\n\n\nCanada has recently developed a coordinated approach: the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (the Alliance) released a draft National Research Software Strategy (2023)alliancecan.ca. This strategy builds on work formerly done by CANARIE (which ran a Research Software funding program for a decade). Highlights include:\n\n\nTreating Software as Infrastructure: The Canadian strategy explicitly notes that the traditional model of one-off grants for software development left many tools unsupported after the grant ended. It praises a pilot by the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) that treated software platforms as infrastructure and provided ongoing operating funds after initial developmentalliancecan.caalliancecan.ca. This was “the first funding program in Canada to recognize that software platforms require operational support after initial development”alliancecan.caalliancecan.ca. The strategy recommends expanding such models, essentially echoing the call that software maintenance must be funded like maintenance of labs or equipment.\n\nNational Coordination – 3 Cs: The plan is organized around three high-level goals: Capability, Community, and Coordinationalliancecan.ca.\nCapability refers to developing technical capacity – supporting a range of software from domain-specific tools to broad platforms, ensuring they are robust and sustainable. Canada has many “substantial yet fragile” software assets, so it plans to shore up critical codes and encourage reuse of platforms across institutionsalliancecan.ca.\n\nCommunity entails growing the human network of RSEs, developers, and scientists. The strategy cites the need for training programs and career incentives in Canada to retain talent (many Canadian RSEs had no clear career track). Surveys indicated a desire for better recognition of software workalliancecan.caalliancecan.ca.\n\nCoordination means aligning efforts across regions, disciplines, and with international initiatives. Canada aims to avoid duplication by having a central coordination of software infrastructure, and by participating in global forums (like RDA or the Global Research Software Alliance) to adopt best practices.\n\nConcrete Actions: The strategy document (95 pages) provides numerous recommendations for 2025–2030, such as establishing a national software registry, funding cross-disciplinary “innovation hubs” around software, and integrating software into open science policies. It also calls for sustained support of widely-used Canadian-developed software (for example, computational biology and environmental modeling tools that many researchers rely on).\n\n\nIn practice, the Alliance (formed from merging CANARIE with Compute Canada and Research Data Canada) now houses a Software team that will implement this strategy, funding development and maintenance projects and offering platforms like the Canadian Research Software Registrycanarie.ca.\n\n\nAustralia 🇦🇺\n\n\nIn Australia, awareness of research software’s importance has grown through the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and related eResearch organizations:\n\n\nARDC has initiated a Research Software Program to drive a national agenda for software sustainability. They explicitly state the goal is to “recognise research software as a first-class research output”, fundamental to research, and to develop a culture that values and supports itardc.edu.au. This language mirrors what we’ve seen elsewhere, underlining a global convergence on that principle.\n\nOne concrete effort is a project to “Sustain Research Software” beyond its original timeframeardc.edu.au. This involves selecting key Australian research software tools that are at risk and providing funds and expertise to extend their life and user baseardc.edu.au. By doing so, ARDC not only keeps important tools running, but also learns general lessons about sustainability that can be applied broadly.\n\nThe Australian eResearch community has also focused on guidance and training. For example, the ARDC organized webinars and guides on topics like “Publishing Research Software” and “FAIR software” in the early 2020s. Australian institutions increasingly encourage researchers to deposit code in repositories (like GitHub or disciplinary archives) and to attach DOIs via services like Zenodo.\n\nIn policy terms, Australia’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) recognizes software as part of digital infrastructure. The 2016 National Research Infrastructure Roadmap noted the need for investment in both tools and skills to maximize ROI on big instruments and data collections.\n\n\nAustralia also actively contributes to international efforts: for instance, Australian experts were involved in drafting the FAIR4RS principles, and ARDC is a partner in the global Research Software Alliance. There is also movement on the institutional level (e.g., the University of New South Wales has an internal policy for managing and licensing research software outputs).\n\n\nSummary: Countries like Canada and Australia, somewhat later to the game, have the advantage of building on others’ experiences. Their recent reports echo familiar refrains – treat software as infrastructure, fund its maintenance, build human capacity, and embed software in open science mandates. It’s notable that regardless of size or funding system, nations are coming to very similar conclusions about best practices.\n\n\nInternational Policy Bodies and Agreements\n\n\nOECD – Open Science and Data Recommendations\n\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which often issues recommendations adopted by member governments, has increasingly included research software in its purview:\n\n\nIn 2021, the OECD updated its Recommendation on Access to Research Data from Public Funding (originally from 2006) to explicitly include research software. This move by the OECD Council was significant – it formally advises governments to ensure not just data, but also code, algorithms, and workflows resulting from publicly funded research are shared openly and preserved when possibleoecd.orgoecd.org. The rationale is that software is necessary to validate and reuse data; thus open data policies are incomplete without open source (or at least accessible) software.\n\nAn OECD policy note “Open Science – Enabling Discovery in the Digital Age” (2020) stressed that open science means sharing “publicly funded research outputs including research data and software” to the fullest extentouvrirlascience.fr. It highlighted the need for sustainable infrastructure (data and software repositories, computational platforms) and skilled support personnel to handle these outputsgoingdigital.oecd.orggoingdigital.oecd.org.\n\nThe OECD note also pointed out that many countries lacked policy alignment on software and that there were insufficient incentives for open science practices like code sharinggoingdigital.oecd.orggoingdigital.oecd.org. Among its recommendations:\nInvest in Sustainable Repositories: Governments should secure long-term funding for repositories that host data and software, and improve their interoperability globallygoingdigital.oecd.orggoingdigital.oecd.org.\n\nSupport Standards and Tools: International standards for things like software metadata, identifiers, and quality metrics should be developed and adopted, to facilitate software reuse across bordersgoingdigital.oecd.orggoingdigital.oecd.org.\n\nHuman Capital: The OECD explicitly called out the need to “attract and retain data scientists and research software engineers” through attractive career pathsgoingdigital.oecd.org. It suggested that member countries create roles in academia and industry that reward the curating of data and code, bridging a known gap in the workforce.\n\n\nThese OECD guidelines influence national policies. For instance, the mention of research software in the OECD’s data recommendation was later cited in the UK’s national policy and by ReSA in advocating for government actionsoftware.ac.uksoftware.ac.uk. It essentially gives top-down legitimacy for countries to broaden their open science mandates to cover code.\n\n\nUNESCO – Recommendation on Open Science (2021)\n\n\nIn November 2021, UNESCO’s General Conference adopted the Recommendation on Open Science, an international framework meant to guide countries in shaping open science policies. This high-level document explicitly includes open software as one pillar of open science:\n\n\nThe UNESCO Recommendation defines Open Science to encompass open access to scientific publications, open research data, open source software and source code, and open hardwareaalto.fiunesco.org. It calls on member states to promote the use of open licenses to share all these outputs.\n\nIt highlights the role of open-source software as a means to “facilitate the reuse of scientific knowledge” and as an enabler for collaboration. By sharing software and code, scientists and engineers can reproduce studies and adapt tools to new problemsunesco.org.\n\nImportantly, UNESCO’s Recommendation urges removing barriers in accessing software needed for science – for example, suggesting that software produced from public research should generally be made freely available, and that training on using and developing software be provided to researchers globally (to reduce the gap between well-resourced and less-resourced groups). It also ties software to the ideal of equity in science – if essential research software is proprietary or restricted, it can exclude researchers who cannot afford access, so open-source is preferred for inclusivityleidenmadtrics.nlunesco.org.\n\n\nAs a UNESCO norm, this Recommendation has moral suasion. Countries like France, Australia, and South Africa have explicitly referenced it when updating their national open science strategies, ensuring that software is considered alongside data. UNESCO has since been active (often in partnership with Software Heritage) in hosting forums on software preservation (see the 2023 UNESCO-INRIA symposium discussed earlier, which framed software source code as not only a research output but part of our documentary heritageunesco.orgunesco.org).\n\n\nG7 Science Ministers and Global Coordination\n\n\nIn recent years, the G7 nations (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, USA) have also recognized open science – including the sharing of software – as a priority in their joint statements:\n\n\nThe G7 Science & Technology Ministers’ Communiqué (Sendai, 2023) gave open science a prominent place. The Ministers committed to “equitable dissemination of scientific knowledge and publicly funded research outputs including research data and scholarly publications in line with FAIR principles.”ouvrirlascience.fr While “software” isn’t named explicitly in that particular quote, the context (FAIR principles and research outputs) implies code is included as part of the data/outputs ecosystem. Moreover, the G7 ministers “support the efforts of the G7 Open Science Working Group in promoting the interoperability and sustainability of infrastructure for research outputs”ouvrirlascience.frouvrirlascience.fr. This clearly encompasses the digital infrastructure needed for sharing software (such as repositories, archives, and metadata standards).\n\nAn outcome of the G7 Open Science Working Group has been sharing best practices and recommendations among the G7. In 2022–2023, sub-groups of the G7 working group exchanged detailed reports on topics like incentives for open science and infrastructure interoperabilityhal-lara.archives-ouvertes.frhal-lara.archives-ouvertes.fr. For example, they discussed aligning reward systems so that contributions to open software are valued in research assessments (a challenge many national reports also noted). These discussions fed into the 2023 communiqué which prioritizes reforming research evaluation and supporting open science infrastructureouvrirlascience.frouvrirlascience.fr.\n\nG20 and others: Beyond the G7, other international venues have touched on software. The G20 Science ministers in 2017 affirmed support for open scientific data and code sharing to address global challenges. And regional blocs like the African Open Science Platform (AOSP) include aims to build software development capacity and ensure locally developed research software can be sustained.\n\n\nOverall, the inclusion of research software in such high-level international statements is a sign that the issue has moved from niche to mainstream. What was once chiefly a concern of IT departments and individual scientists is now on the agenda of science ministers and global organizations – a testament to the advocacy and evidence built by all the reports and efforts detailed above.\n\n\nCross-Cutting Themes and Emerging Best Practices\n\n\nBringing together the insights from these national and international reports, several common themes and policy trends emerge:\n\n\nTreat Software as First-Class Research Output: Nearly all reports call for recognizing software’s importance for research on par with publications and dataf1000research.comouvrirlascience.fr. This means academic and funding systems should value creating and maintaining software as a legitimate, rewarded activity. Many countries are embedding this principle in policy (e.g., requiring software management plans, encouraging software citation in CVs).\n\nFunding Models for Maintenance: A consistent challenge identified is the funding gap for maintaining software after initial development. Best practice recommendations suggest:\nCreating dedicated funding programs or budget lines for software maintenance and iterative improvement (NSF’s multi-level programswgropp.cs.illinois.edu, CANARIE/CFI’s infrastructure+operations modelalliancecan.ca, UK’s continued SSI funding).\n\nAllowing grant proposals to include costs for updating or refactoring existing software, not only for building new tools.\n\nSupporting institutes or consortia that provide long-term homes for widely-used software (e.g., the UK SSI model, planned US URSSI, or Inria’s model of hosting important software projects).\n\nOpen Source and FAIR Principles: There is an overwhelming push toward making research software open source by default (with proper licenses) and FAIR (well-documented, indexed, and reusable)ouvrirlascience.frresearchsoft.org. This is seen as key to both transparency in science and to enabling others to sustain or adapt the software. The FAIR4RS principles (2022) provide a guideline that many organizations are now adopting to audit and improve their software outputsresearchsoft.org.\n\nInfrastructure for Preservation and Reuse: Multiple reports stress investing in digital infrastructure:\nRepositories and Registries: to archive code (e.g., Software Heritageunesco.org, domain repositories, or institutional GitLab/Bitbucket servers) and to catalog software (so that researchers can find existing tools rather than reinvent them). The EOSC and others advocate connecting these into federated networks so software artifacts are widely discoverableop.europa.eu.\n\nPersistent Identifiers (PIDs): Use of DOIs for software releases (through Zenodo, figshare, etc.) and emerging identifiers like SWHIDs for source code ensures long-term traceabilityouvrirlascience.fr. Many reports recommend funders and journals require such identifiers when referencing software.\n\nContinuous Integration of Hardware and Software Roadmaps: As UK’s and others note, planning for new big hardware (HPC, experimental facilities) must include resources to co-develop software that runs on itresearchsoft.org. Otherwise, hardware advances outpace the software’s ability to use it (a form of technical debt).\n\nSkills and Roles (Human Infrastructure): The rise of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) as a recognized role is a direct response to sustainability issues. Reports from the UK, US, Germany, and OECD all emphasize creating career paths for people who develop and support research softwaregoingdigital.oecd.org. Best practices here include:\nFunding RSE fellowship programs or staff positions on projects.\n\nIncluding software contributions in academic promotion criteria (for example, accepting software repositories or new algorithms as part of a thesis or tenure portfolio).\n\nOffering training (like Software Carpentry workshops, which originated in Software Sustainability Institute efforts) to ensure researchers have basic skills in writing sustainable code.\n\nIncentives and Culture Change: Virtually every analysis notes that technical fixes alone won’t work without cultural change in academia. Key recommended actions:\nCredit and Citation: Develop norms and systems to cite software properly in papers (e.g., the Software Citation Principles endorsed by FORCE11). Give awards or recognition for outstanding research software contributions (some countries have started “best software” prizes).\n\nEvaluation Reform: Align with initiatives like DORA and the new research assessment reforms to ensure that contributions to open science (including software and data) are valued. The G7 specifically is pushing for evaluations that value a diversity of outputsouvrirlascience.frouvrirlascience.fr.\n\nCommunity Building: Support networks and conferences (like the international RSE conferences, the WSSSPE workshop series on sustainable software, etc.) to share knowledge and foster peer support. A strong community can develop its own standards and resources (for example, the **“Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing” guideresearchsoft.org came from community discussions and is now widely referenced).\n\nNational Strategies and Coordination: We see a trend of countries writing national strategies or plans for research software (Australia, Canada recently, UK and NL implicitly via e-infrastructure plans). A best practice is to coordinate these with related areas – e.g., aligning data, computing, and software plans since they are interdependent. International bodies like the OECD, RDA, and GO FAIR have been facilitating knowledge exchange so that policies are harmonized and not working at cross-purposes. The coordination also extends to funding calls (e.g., the EU and countries co-fund programs like CHIST-ERA that include software as part of data/software callsalliancecan.ca).\n\n\nIn conclusion, the past 20 years have seen a maturing consensus on how to achieve research software sustainability. Early recognition of the problem has given way to concrete recommendations and nascent implementation of solutions. Different nations’ reports reinforce each other – what one region identifies, others echo – leading to a set of global best practices now being put in place. These include treating software as a valued scholarly output, planning and funding for its long-term maintenance, leveraging open-source principles, building supportive infrastructure, and nurturing the people who develop and maintain software.\n\n\nThe result is a slowly emerging framework in which research software is less of an afterthought and more an integral, planned part of the scientific enterprise. As these reports have influenced policy, we are beginning to see positive outcomes: more research projects sharing their code openly, a growing cadre of RSEs, and multi-national collaborations to preserve important scientific software. Sustaining research software is an ongoing challenge – technology and needs constantly evolve – but the collective efforts documented from 2005–2025 provide a strong foundation for future work. The continued exchange of knowledge and coordination (through venues like the Research Data Alliance, international coalitions, and global science forums) will be key to refining and adapting these sustainability strategies in the years ahead.\n\n\nReferences (Reports & Sources):\n\n\nNSF ACCI Task Force on Software for Science & Engineering, Final Report, 2010wgropp.cs.illinois.eduwgropp.cs.illinois.edu.\n\nU.S. NSF SI2 Program Solicitations and Overviewwgropp.cs.illinois.edu.\n\nKatz et al., “Addressing Research Software Sustainability via Institutes”, IEEE Workshop BoKSS 2021par.nsf.govpar.nsf.gov.\n\nNSF-supported URSSI conceptualization workshops (URSSI reports, 2018)par.nsf.govpar.nsf.gov.\n\nSSI (UK), Software Sustainability Institute – Key Achievements, 2010–2020par.nsf.govpar.nsf.gov.\n\nUK Government Office for Science, “Large-Scale Computing: The Case for Greater UK Coordination”, 2018researchsoft.org.\n\nHettrick, S.
