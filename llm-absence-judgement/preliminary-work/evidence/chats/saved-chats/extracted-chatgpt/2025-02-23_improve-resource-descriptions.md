## Conversation

### Human (06:53:50)

Hi o3

At the next prompt, I am going to provide you with entries from a spreadsheet describing digital resources for archaeology.

We need to improve the data in the following ways:

1. improve its description to a 50-100 word description
2. decide if the following tool definition applies 

<definition>

For our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software—be it a program, script, or web application—that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets—without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement—are excluded. 

In essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.

</definition>

If the resource does meet this definition, please: 

1. Add a new column named 'archhist-software-tool' to the spreadsheet if it does not already exist.
2. Place a 'yes' or a 'no' in that column to indicate whether or not the resource meets our definition of a tool. 

Output:

Please output the following columns: 'item_name' (unchanged from original), 'description' (with the original description), 'Improved description' (with your improved description), and 'archist-software-tool' as a CSV in a fenced code block. 

Do you understand these instructions?

### Tool (06:53:57)

**Improving digital resource descriptions**

The user is looking to improve entries for digital resources in archaeology. I'll focus on enhancing the descriptions, aiming for that 50-100 word range. I'll also need to evaluate whether the provided definition of a software tool applies to each resource. Specifically, I’m considering whether it's actively used for tasks like data processing, analysis, or automation. If it's more about displaying or storing data without offering computational engagement, then it likely doesn't fit the definition. Let's see how each resource stacks up!

**Confirming understanding**

Yes, I understand the instructions. I’ll improve each description and determine if the resource meets the software tool definition for archaeology—whether it's actively collecting and/or processing data. Then, I’ll produce a CSV with these columns: *item_name*, *description*, *Improved description*, and *archhist-software-tool*. I do notice a small error, though—there’s a slight mismatch in the column name. It says "archhist-software-tool" in the instructions, but "archist-software-tool" in the output. I’ll use "archhist-software-tool" to be consistent with the instructions. Let's get started!

### Assistant (06:53:57) [Model: o3-mini-high]

Yes, I understand your instructions. Once you provide the spreadsheet entries, I will create an improved description (50–100 words) for each entry and determine whether it meets the definition of a research-oriented software tool. I will then output a CSV (in a fenced code block) containing the following columns:  
- **item_name** (unchanged from the original)  
- **description** (the original description)  
- **Improved description** (the enhanced 50–100 word description)  
- **archist-software-tool** (with a "yes" or "no" based on the definition)

Please provide the entries when you’re ready.

### Tool (06:57:07)

**Processing dataset**

The dataset includes rows focusing on digital archaeology resources. Each row needs to be processed by improving the description to 50-100 words, which seems like an important starting point. 

Then, I need to evaluate whether a particular tool fits the defined criteria. A software tool for this project should be active in data processing, like doing analysis, simulation, or automation. It must involve dynamic data tasks, not just things that display or store static datasets. I'll have to decide based on these criteria for each entry. Let's get to work!

**Clarifying resource processing**

For each resource, I need to check if it meets the software tool criteria. If it does, I should add the column "archist-software-tool" with a yes/no value. There's a slight spelling inconsistency in the instructions: step 1 says "archhist-software-tool," but later instructions use "archist." I'll stick with "archist-software-tool" as per the output requirement.

Each row has tabs separating columns, and I need to focus on the first two: "item_name" and "description". I'll ignore the extra columns and process accordingly. Let's get started!

**Processing resource entries**

For each row, the "item_name" is the first field, and the "description" is the second. I need to decide if it's a software tool and include a 50-100 word improved description. For example, the "tdar" R package provides programmatic access to the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR). It's definitely a computational tool (API interface for data retrieval and analysis), so it qualifies as a software tool ("yes"). The improved description was 80 words, so I'll output the CSV row for it. Next, I'll check the "SPARTAAS" entry.

**Analyzing software tools**

For each resource, I’m improving the description and verifying if it qualifies as a software tool. For "SPARTAAS," it clearly meets the criteria, as it aids in archaeological data analysis. The description is exactly 80 words, so it's within the range. "Bonify" is also a software tool for visualizing 3D models, qualifying as active data processing, and the description is 71 words. "Alligator" serves as a web-based tool for converting data into RDF, and its description is 81 words. All of these are "yes" for "archist-software-tool." Now, I'll check "geoCore."

**Checking resource "geoCore" and others**

"geoCore" meets the software tool definition, as it processes data to create graphical representations of drilling profiles. The description is 77 words, fitting perfectly. For "Tachy2GIS," it's also a software tool, facilitating geometry creation from tachymeter input, with a description of 75 words. "bioanth" is slightly tricky: it's an R package for datasets, not active data processing, so it doesn't qualify as a research tool. The description there is 91 words, and I marked it as "no". Lastly, "RoomAccum" is a simulation tool for estimating population growth rates, so it qualifies with its description.

**Analyzing "RoomAccum" and others**

"RoomAccum" qualifies as a research tool: its simulation of room accumulation to estimate population growth in archaeology actively processes data. The description has 87 words, fitting nicely.

For "babylonian-hours," it doesn’t meet the research tool definition. It’s a novelty, providing educational or creative content about seasonal hours, not processing archaeological data, so I marked it "no" with a description of 79 words.

"Hammurabi-markov" is similar. It doesn’t process archaeological or historical research data in any meaningful way. Thus, I marked it "no," even though it uses a Markov chain for text generation. I directly follow the provided guidelines.

**Analyzing "hammurabi-markov" and "cleanc14"**

"Hammurabi-markov" is a simple web app for generating fake laws based on the Hammurabi Code using a Markov process. While it processes data, it's more of a novelty tool rather than a research-focused one. I lean towards "no" since it doesn't actively support archaeological research. Word count: 81.

"cleanc14" is an R package designed for cleaning and processing radiocarbon data, which means it's a tool that actively processes data. So, it's an excellent fit for a research tool. Word count: 78.

**Reviewing archaeological tools**

Iraq_mortar creates high-quality 3D models for archaeological artefacts using photo-masking, which is an active form of data processing. It provides precise models, aiding archaeological analysis and conservation. Word count: 72.

ElementSourcing automates the elemental composition analysis of artifacts, streamlining the sourcing process and supporting comparative studies in archaeology. Word count: 76.

elemSource is similar, an R package for analyzing elemental data that aids in provenance studies by using techniques like X-Ray Fluorescence. Word count: 83.

CeramicApportioning is a computational tool for apportioning ceramic assemblages chronologically. Its statistical methods improve precision in dating ceramic materials. Word count: 81.

**Describing computational tools**

Kairos is an R package designed for analyzing patterns in archaeological chronological data. It uses statistical methods to model temporal trends and helps interpret data dynamics, enhancing the understanding of cultural movements and developments.

Nexus is another R package that utilizes chemical composition analysis for sourcing archaeological materials, supporting artifact classification and provenance studies.

TransmissionBias models cultural transmission using an agent-based framework, exploring bias forms in cultural evolution and archaeological theory.

Skeletal-sex-estimation is a GNU Octave function streamlining skeletal sex estimation through computational algorithms. 

Word count: 80.

**Describing analytical tools for skeletal studies**

The Long-bone-diaphyseal-CSG-Toolkit automates the extraction and analysis of long bone data to enhance skeletal research, supporting comparative studies and improving bone mechanics analysis.

SkullAnalyzer automates cranial feature extraction, ensuring consistent, reproducible results and supporting objective cranial analysis.

Cranial-sex-estimation-code analyzes cranial data to estimate sex, aiding in method validation using statistical analysis and data visualization.

Non-metric-trait-analysis uses GNU Octave functions to analyze biodistance based on non-metric traits to improve morphological research.

Word count: 98.

**Describing analysis tools for skeletal research**

Non-metric-trait-analysis is an R package designed for biodistance analysis using non-metric traits. It aids researchers in quantifying morphological differences and conducting comparative studies in biological anthropology and zooarchaeology. By automating non-metric data analysis, it enhances reproducibility and efficiency.

p2pPerm automates the retrieval of key metrics from radiocarbon tests, aiding in the efficient and reproducible analysis of chronological variability.

Near-Presence-Analysis is a tool for interpreting presence/absence data from archaeological surveys, enhancing site distribution analysis. 

Arothron supports 3D modeling, data alignment, and format conversions for digital morphological analysis.  

Word count: 99.

**Explaining geostatistical and chronological tools**

CSGR is a tool that extracts and calculates key parameters from long bone cross-sections, focusing on cortical thickness and biomechanically relevant properties. It's particularly useful in skeletal research for understanding bone strength and function.

Kriging is a geostatistical tool for predicting spatial distributions, helping researchers analyze ethnographic and archaeological data for patterns based on spatial correlation.

### Tool (07:05:18)

**Evaluating task list**

I’ve been given this new spreadsheet with 31 entries. Each entry needs to be transformed and output as a CSV with columns for "item_name", "description", "Improved description" (a 50-100 word summary), and "archist-software-tool" (marked yes/no based on the provided definition).

Let's see: I need to check all these entries, like ArboDat, xronos.R, Archaeological_Catalogue_from_CSV_Spreadsheet, and others to make sure everything fits the correct categories and definitions. Seems like a straight task, but I'll need to take care with each.

**Reviewing tool descriptions**

I’ve got more entries to look through: UniformProbabilityDensityAnalysis, charcoalhearths, p3k14c-data-scrubbing, rock-art-transfer-learning, UThwigl, and the rest. I need to summarize these tool descriptions with a 50-100 word "Improved description" and mark whether each tool is an "archist-software-tool" with a simple yes or no statement.

For tools like "GlobaLID-App" or "pXRF," the description will be pretty clear, but I also need to check things like "nearpresence" and "kidstats" for consistency. Let’s keep going!

**Processing description entries**

I’m looking at the entries here, like ArboDat and xronos.R. ArboDat clearly seems to involve active data processing — registering, importing, and evaluating archaeological data, so it qualifies as a valid tool. I’ll create an improved description for it to summarize its functionality in about 80 words.

But xronos.R presents a tricky case. It’s described as a database, and if it’s just a static data repository, it wouldn’t meet the requirements for a tool. I’ll need to check further before deciding.

**Analyzing software tools**

For xronos.R, it seems like a static dataset since its description focuses on being a database of chronological data. It's likely a tool for accessing, but not actively processing or analyzing data, so "no" for being an archist software tool. 

Archaeological_Catalogue_from_CSV_Spreadsheet is another tool that, despite automating formatting, is more about static manipulation, not data processing, so I'll mark that as "no" too.

SCEM, on the other hand, clearly processes data and models birth seasonality, so it's "yes."

And for MarblePlan, it seems to lean toward active processing even if it’s a viewer, so I’ll go with "yes" for now.

**Assessing software tools**

UniformProbabilityDensityAnalysis is an R package for statistical processing, making it a "yes" as an archist software tool. It's involved in active data processing by utilizing probabilistic methods. 

Charcoalhearths analyzes geotiff images to detect charcoal hearths, which is active data processing, so that's another "yes."

p3k14c-data-scrubbing is a Python tool for cleaning and prepping data — definitely a "yes."

Rock-art-transfer-learning uses machine learning for chronological insights, marking it as a "yes."

UThwigl processes U-Th dating, confirming it's a "yes."

**Summarizing tools**

For *rbacon* and *pollencount*, both offer active computational features like Bayesian modeling and pollen grain simulation, so they're "yes" tools.

*OpenLidarToolbox* processes LiDAR data, qualifying it as an active processing tool with "yes."

*pXRF* handles portable XRF data analysis, marking it as "yes."

*Nearpresence* identifies spatial patterns via statistical analysis, so it's "yes."

*DACORD* and *RACORD* process data related to pottery recognition and classification, both of which make them "yes" tools!

Lastly, *dplR* and *xDateR* are both essential computational tools for tree-ring analysis, so "yes" for both!

**Confirming tools and definitions**

For *kidstats* and *tRauma*, both are interactive tools for data processing in forensic anthropology, making them "yes" tools.

*Pygeoroc* serves primarily as a data access library to an existing database, which doesn't actively process data — a "no."

*Open History Map* allows for interactive exploration and analysis of historical and archaeological data, making it a "yes."

*hsv-api*, being an API for querying historical street images, qualifies as "yes."

*Mask_UAV* is a deep learning tool for data segmentation, making it a "yes."

### Tool (07:31:31)

**Creating CSV for digital resources**

I need to process rows with data for digital resources and generate a CSV. The columns should be: item_name, description, an improved description (50-100 words), and archist-software-tool, which will be marked as "yes" or "no" based on our previous pattern.

I'll check the entry "sexEst" and follow the pattern for others. Each improved description should reflect the functionality of the resource. I’ll stick to the definition: a software tool here must be involved in active data processing, like analysis or modeling, as described.

**Analyzing "SexEst" software tool**

For "SexEst," the primary function is to use machine learning to predict the sex of unknown skeletons based on measurements. Since it involves active data processing with machine learning models, it qualifies as a software tool, so I would mark it as "yes" for archist-software-tool.

For the improved description, I’ll summarize this as: "SexEst is a Python package using machine learning to predict the sex of unknown skeletal remains from cranial and postcranial measurements. It automates and improves accuracy in skeletal analysis, making it essential for bioanthropological research." This fits within 100 words!

**Analyzing software tools and descriptions**

For "web_geochemistry," the term "visualizing" makes it likely an active processing tool, so I think it qualifies as a software tool ("yes"). It's an R package for visualizing geochemistry concentrations from XRF and NAA tests.

For the improved description: "web_geochemistry is an R package that provides interactive visualizations of XRF and NAA concentration data. It allows researchers to analyze and compare elemental compositions through dynamic plotting, boosting the interpretation of geochemical datasets."

Next is "ithaca," which uses deep neural networks for restoring ancient texts, so it's another "yes."

**Clarifying "MapofComputationalArchaeology"**

"MapofComputationalArchaeology" visualizes digital archaeology as a fantasy landscape, but it isn't about processing or analyzing data actively. The main purpose seems to be more artistic or static, which does not align with the definition of a software tool needing to actively process data. Based on that, I’ll classify this as "no," as its function doesn't include active data manipulation or research-focused computational tasks. It's probably better categorized as a visualization product.

**Clarifying different software tools**

For "MapofComputationalArchaeology," it seems more like a visualization product rather than an active data processing tool. It's likely best classified as "no" since it doesn't actively process input data — it just displays a fancy map for creative or aesthetic purposes rather than academic analysis.

For "chronup," "recmod," and "timeperiod2daterange," all are active data processing tools, and I've described their features as such.

I also detailed the descriptions for "rock-art-radnet" and others, all of which perform active data processing.

**Analyzing "arches-via-docker" deployment tool**

The "arches-via-docker" package is designed to help with the deployment of the Arches platform, which is used for cultural heritage management. However, deployment tools typically don't actively process data themselves—they just help set up environments for tools that do. Since this one assists with installation rather than actively processing data, it doesn't fit the definition of a software tool for research activities.

I'll classify it as "no." It’s more of an infrastructure tool than an active research tool.

**Classifying "BraDypUS" data management tool**

"BraDypUS" is a software tool used for creating, implementing, and publishing relational databases on the web. Although it primarily supports data management, it likely prompts active query processing, making it a useful resource for managing dynamic databases. While some might categorize it as an infrastructure tool, its active role in managing and querying data qualifies it as a research tool. So, I'll classify it as "yes," since it supports active data processing.

**Classifying "ChronoLog" tool**

"ChronoLog" is a software tool for computer-assisted chronological research in archaeology. It organizes, analyzes, and visualizes temporal data, which is essential for constructing accurate chronological models. By automating the evaluation of categorical data, it helps identify underlying trends and associations in archaeological data sets. Its dynamic functionalities allow for in-depth research and interpretation, making it a powerful aid in archaeological research. Given its active data processing capabilities, it's an invaluable resource for improving the efficiency and reproducibility of temporal analyses.



**Evaluating Tools for Archaeological Research**

MapofComputationalArchaeology is a creative tool that visualizes digital archaeology as a fantasy landscape. It transforms archaeological data into engaging imagery, but it's more artistic than analytical. While it provides a novel perspective, it doesn't actively process data for rigorous research purposes.

Chronup, on the other hand, focuses on propagating chronological uncertainty, providing computational methods to refine archaeological timelines, enhancing the accuracy of temporal models. It plays an active role with its data processing capabilities.

Let me check if I got that right—OK, moving on.

**Summarizing Tools for Archaeological Research**

BraDypUS facilitates the creation of relational databases on the web with a focus on archaeology. It enables real-time querying and updating, supporting dynamic data processing for enhanced accessibility.
   
ArchaeoAstroInsight computes key astronomical parameters, empowering archaeoastronomical research via seamless integration with QGIS. It helps researchers interpret celestial alignments in archaeological sites.

Both tools integrate computational capabilities that streamline research workflows while improving data accessibility and precision.

### Tool (07:39:49)

**Analyzing tool description**

First, I need to improve the description for the tool "Excavation_data_viewer." It looks like it's an R Shiny app meant for visualizing archaeological excavation data in 3D. The description could be refined to highlight its functionality and relevance in archaeological research. Based on its use of R and categories like data management and 3D modeling, I'll need to think about whether it qualifies as "archist-software-tool" or not. Let's work on improving that description and decide on its classification.

**Improving tool descriptions**

I need to improve the descriptions for a few tools here. First, "ARchaeology" appears to view AR models on a phone, and it deals with 3D modeling, augmented reality, and site mapping. Then there's "StoneAdvisor," which is about exploring and sharing archaeological sites and itineraries. I'll need to enhance the descriptions to really capture what these tools do.

Next, I need to work on "3D_EdgeAngle," "isopleuros," "ZooarchMixMod," and others. Let me refine each description and assess whether they qualify as "archist-software-tool."



**Evaluating software tools**

I’m reviewing several tools now and considering how each fits the definition given. For "ARchaeology," it's probably more of a viewer for AR models, so it doesn't seem to involve active data processing — I’ll lean towards "no". Likewise, **StoneAdvisor** is about sharing and exploring archaeological sites, which also doesn’t seem to be data processing, so "no" again. On the other hand, **3D_EdgeAngle** clearly involves active data processing for 3D models and seems like a "yes". I’m going to keep evaluating the rest based on this.

**Reviewing tool qualifications**

I need to go through each tool carefully now:

For **WeedEco**, it's classified as active data processing because it uses linear discriminant analysis to classify data, so "yes," it qualifies. **CropPro** also actively processes data for archaeobotanical analysis, so that's a "yes." **ArchaeolPhytoliths**, **ruby-radiocarbon**, and **dendroNetwork** likewise actively process relevant data, so those are "yes."

However, **ABMA_tutorials** is more educational than computational, so that’s a "no." Tools focused primarily on visualization or static datasets, like **vici.org** or **ExtendedMatrix**, don't seem to fit the definition so I’d lean towards "no" for them too. I’ll keep going and check each one in detail!

**Evaluating tool functionalities**

For **mafa**, it's computing morphological indices of spatial entities, which means it’s actively processing spatial data, so I would classify it as "yes." Similarly, **SiteSyncro**, which does chronological modeling, and **baorista**, which provides Bayesian inference for analyzing time frequencies, both actively process data, so they're also classified as "yes." These tools contribute substantially to archaeological research data handling and analysis, which is key for classifying them properly in the CSV. Continuing to check their relevance and fit based on actual data processing functionality!

**Clarifying analysis tools**

For **Aion**, I see it's designed to handle archaeological time-series data using an array of classes and methods, which makes it a tool for active data processing. It helps researchers organize, analyze, and dynamically test data, making it a "yes."

Similarly, **alkahest** and **Akkademia** are both focused on pre-processing and applying NLP to archaeological data (spatial and textual), which is active data processing. They're also "yes." **ArcheOS**, however, is a Linux environment, not providing direct data processing—so its classification is "no." The rest look pretty clear-cut!

**Refining analysis tools**

The tools and software for the archaeological field nest nicely in this batch! For example, **Scroll Viewer** is a useful tool but more passive in that it just displays data, so it’s not a "yes." **mobest** is all about processing spatial-temporal genetic data, so definitely qualifies as a "yes." Similarly, **pastclim** is also a "yes" for active data processing, while **ExtendedMatrix** is conceptually rich but more formal in application, not engaging in dynamic data handling—so it’s a "no."

Got the hang of it now!

**Refining archaeological tools**

I’m continuing my review of these cool tools! For instance, **WeedEco** is a "yes" as it processes data for classifying archaeobotanical data, actively aiding research. **CropPro** is also a clear "yes" due to its active data processing and insightful analysis of crop processing. Meanwhile, **ABMA_tutorials** is informative but more of an educational resource rather than an active analytical tool, landing it as a "no." Tracking these tools helps ensure I get it right!

### Human (07:51:51)

I am going to give you CSV of items that you determined did not meet our definition of tools. Examine each more closely, and:

1. Review your decision and confirm that the item is not a tool under our definition. I have supplied the definition again below. Please change 'archist-software-tool' to 'yes' if you change your mind and decide it does meet the definition, otherwise leave it as a 'no'. Note that the definition has not changed.
2. Whether or not you change your mind, please remove your justification from 'Improved description' and revise 'Improved description' so that it is a neutral 50-100 description of the item.
3. Whether or not you think an item is a software tool by our definition, move your reasoning to a new column labeled 'Reasoning' and explain why you do or do not think the item is a tool.

<definition>

For our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software—be it a program, script, or web application—that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets—without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement—are excluded. 

In essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.

</definition>

Do you understand your instructions? If so I will privide the CSV.

### Tool (07:51:56)

**Reviewing user prompt**

The user has asked me to review a CSV containing items I previously identified as not meeting the definition of “tools.” I need to carefully consider each item again with that definition in mind. I will check if any decisions need to be changed, and if I change my mind, I’ll mark it as "yes." I must also update the description to be neutral and concise and create a new column for reasoning to explain my decisions in detail. I'll make sure to follow the user’s instructions carefully!

### Tool (07:53:32)

**Reviewing items in CSV**

I need to go through each item in the CSV and re-evaluate whether it meets our definition of a tool. For each item, I’ll decide if it should be labeled ‘yes’ or ‘no’ under 'archist-software-tool'. If I change my mind, I’ll update that. Also, I’ll revise the "Improved description" column to be a neutral 50-100 word description. The "Reasoning" column will include why I think the item is or isn't a tool according to the definition we’re using.

**Evaluating first item**

I need to review the item "field-photographs." The description says it’s an Android app for photography during fieldwork. The original improved description feels like a neutral description, but I need to assess if it fits the definition of a software tool. According to the definition, it does not seem to involve active data processing such as analysis or modeling. 

Therefore, I’ll likely mark this as 'no' under "archist-software-tool," and I’ll adjust the description slightly to reflect that it’s more about capturing still images rather than doing anything computational.

**Refining apps and definitions**

First, I’ll mark the "Field-photographs" one as 'no' because it’s more about data capture (photos) than active data processing. I’ll adjust the description to reflect that it doesn’t perform computational tasks but is a tool for recording information.

On to the next—"Archaeological-survey-location-collector" also focuses on gathering data but lacks real-time processing, so it’ll get a similar ‘no’ with corresponding changes to the description. I'll keep those patterns in mind for the other items.

I’ll proceed with the next ones in the same way, ensuring consistency.

**Organizing items and refining descriptions**

For "AIS," I see its role as organizing rather than computing, so I'll describe it as a data management tool rather than anything that actively processes data.

ARK1 and Ark2 are focused on organizing and presenting archaeological data, so I'll stick to a similar conclusion for both: useful for managing data but not for computation.

The rest follow the same pattern — I'll define them as tools for organizing or storing data but not for dynamic analysis. Good to keep those distinctions clear. I'll keep tightening up each revision.

**Assessing tools and descriptions**

I've noticed that many of these items are centered around data storage, management, and sharing, not computational processing. For example, "archaeology-data-service" focuses on collecting artifacts and their metadata but doesn't process that data actively.

Likewise, "ArchaeologyAdventure" and similar projects, such as "gods_on_the_barge," are geared towards education, entertainment, or creative expression rather than data analysis or research. I’ll continue identifying these as tools for organizing or sharing data, not for computation.

So, for all of them, I'll ensure my reasoning is clear: they don’t perform dynamic processing.

**Refining and organizing**

For "Heurist," it’s clear that this tool focuses on data management and basic analysis, but it doesn't quite meet the active computational analysis requirement—so I'll describe it as focusing on organizing research data rather than dynamic computational processing.

Similarly with "HumanOS" and "iDAI.field", both focus on the recording and managing of archaeological data, without any computational analysis happening.

"OpenAtlas" and "bioanth" follow a similar path — they store and organize data for research but don’t compute anything.

I’ll proceed in this same way, making each distinction clear.
