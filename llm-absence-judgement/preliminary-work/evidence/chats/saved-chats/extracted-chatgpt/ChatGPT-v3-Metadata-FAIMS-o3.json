      "say": "we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.\n\n\nArchaeological Research Software Tools Metadata Collection\n\n\nGround Rules\n\n\nACCURACY FIRST: Do not make claims without supporting evidence. If uncertain, clearly indicate uncertainty. Double-check your work even if that requires more time.\n\nTHOROUGH RESEARCH: Conduct comprehensive research using all available sources including repositories, scholarly literature, official documentation, and reliable mentions, even if it takes more time.\n\nMETHODICAL APPROACH: Follow a systematic research process and document findings carefully.\n\nRECENCY FOCUS: All metadata must reflect the most recent version of the software as of the access date, unless specifically noted.\n\nCONTROLLED VOCABULARY: Strictly adhere to the provided controlled lists for compatibility with the Open-Archaeo project.\n\n\nResearch Methodology\n\n\nBegin with official sources (project website, documentation, repositories)\n\nExpand to scholarly literature discussing the tool\n\nConsider community resources and discussions\n\nSynthesize findings with careful attention to recency and reliability\n\nFor subjective assessments (strengths, weaknesses, survivability), base conclusions on evidence rather than speculation\n\n\nResearch Standards and Data Quality\n\n\nWhen researching a tool, examine at least the first 20 search results, the tool's official documentation, its source code repositories, and any scholarly articles mentioning it. Prioritize official documentation and peer-reviewed publications over third-party blogs or forums.\n\n\nFor fields where information is unavailable after thorough research, use the following conventions:\n\n\nFor URLs and other web addresses: leave field empty (do not use \"N/A\" or placeholder text)\n\nFor categorical fields with controlled vocabulary: leave empty rather than guessing\n\nFor open text fields requiring subjective assessment: provide your best assessment based on available evidence, but clearly indicate limitations (e.g., \"Based on limited available information...\")\n\nWhen sources conflict: prioritize official documentation, then peer-reviewed publications, then community consensus\n\n\nOutput Format Requirements\n\n\nYou must produce a well-formed, quoted CSV with the following columns:\n\"Tool\", \"Description\", \"History\", \"Access-date\", \"Tool-status\", \"Tool-status-reasoning\", \"DVCS-repo\", \"CRAN\", \"PyPi\", \"Other-URL\", \"Category\", \"Language\", \"Platform\", \"Open-Archaeo-Platform\", \"License\", \"Lifecycle-stage\", \"Type\", \"Interoperability\", \"Strengths\", \"Weaknesses\", \"Survivability\", \"Alternatives\", \"Authors\", \"Tags\", \"AI-tags\"\n\n\nColumn Specifications\n\n\nVersion and Currency Determination\n\n\nTo identify the current version:\n\n\nCheck release dates on repositories and official sites\n\nLook for \"latest release\" or \"current version\" indicators\n\nIf version history is unclear, use the most recently documented version with evidence of being publicly available\n\nNote in the \"Description\" if the tool appears abandoned or unmaintained\n\n\nEssential Information\n\n\nTool: Exact name as provided in the prompt\n\nDescription: Clear, detailed overview (3-5 sentences) of the CURRENT version's purpose and functionality\n\nHistory: Chronological account of the tool's development, including major versions, significant updates, and evolution over time\n\nAccess-date: Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format, representing when this research was conducted\n\nTool-status: One of three values based on the Research Software Tool Definition:\n\"yes\" - clearly meets all essential criteria and sufficient supporting criteria\n\n\"maybe\" - meets some criteria but with uncertainties or borderline characteristics\n\n\"no\" - clearly fails to meet essential criteria\n\nTool-status-reasoning: Detailed explanation of classification decision referencing specific criteria from the framework; for \"maybe\" classifications, explicitly describe uncertainties or borderline aspects that prevent a definitive determination\n\nDVCS-repo: Primary repository URL (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) if available\n\nCRAN: URL if available\n\nPyPi: URL if available\n\nOther-URL: Primary project homepage or documentation site\n\nCategory: Select one value from the Category controlled list below, using only the category name\n\nLanguage: Programming language(s) of CURRENT version, separated by pipes (|)\n\nPlatform: Operating systems/environments supported by CURRENT version\n\nOpen-Archaeo-Platform: Only if \"Category\" is \"Packages and libraries\", otherwise leave empty.

pipe-separated\n\nAI-tags: Five descriptive tags summarizing key aspects of the tool\n\n\nControlled Vocabulary Lists\n\n\nCategory Controlled List\n\n\nPackages and libraries: Sets of functions assembled with clear purpose, and made accessible using standards established by an underlying platform.\n\nStand-alone software: Software that may be operated without needing to first access an underlying platform.\n\nScripts: Sets of pragmatically assembled mutable functions, often lacking complete documentation or adherence to protocols that would otherwise facilitate secondary use outside their original contexts of creation.\n\n\nOpen-Archaeo-Platform Controlled List\n\n\nArcGIS\nAutoCAD\nJavaScript\nLibreOffice Calc\nLisp\nMeshlab\nMicrosoft Excel\nNextflow\nOpen Data

supports historical and archaeological research by facilitating data collection, processing, analysis, visualization, or dissemination in ways that contribute to scholarly inquiry beyond basic storage or display functions.\n\n\nEssential Criteria (Must Meet ALL)\n\n\nResearch-Specific Purpose: Primary function supports research activities rather than exclusively serving general computing tasks\n\nResearch Data Engagement: Collects, transforms, analyzes, visualizes, or facilitates sharing of research materials in discipline-relevant ways\n\nMethodological Alignment: Functions in ways compatible with recognized research methodologies from historical disciplines, even if this alignment is implicit rather than explicitly stated\n\n\nSupporting Criteria (Must Meet at Least TWO)\n\n\nDomain Knowledge Integration: Incorporates terminology, classifications, or procedures relevant to historical disciplines\n\nResearch Lifecycle Support: Addresses one or more research stages (planning, acquisition, processing, analysis, interpretation, publication, preservation)\n\nData Transformation: Converts between formats or representations relevant to historical research\n\nAnalytical Capabilities: Performs calculations, comparisons, or pattern recognition on historical data\n\nVisualization Functions: Renders historical or archaeological data in meaningful visual formats\n\nDocumentation Focus: Contains documentation addressing research applications\n\nData Collection: Specifically designed for gathering research data in field or laboratory settings\n\nData Dissemination: Actively supports sharing, publication, or reuse of research data beyond simple storage\n\n\nConsideration Factors (Not Exclusionary, But Informative)\n\n\nGeneric Functionality: Degree to which functions extend beyond general-purpose software\n\nPassive Repository: Extent of processing capabilities beyond storage\n\nDisplay-Only: Presence of analytical or transformative functions beyond display\n\nCommercial Origin: Despite commercial development, extent of significant research applications or adaptations\n\n\nConfidence Assessment\n\n\nBased on available evidence, classify the tool as:\n\n\nYes: Clearly meets all essential criteria and sufficient supporting criteria\n\nMaybe: Meets some criteria but with uncertainties, limitations, or borderline characteristics\n\nNo: Clearly fails to meet essential criteria\n\n\nEvaluation Process\n\n\nIdentify primary functions and intended use cases\n\nCheck against all Essential Criteria\n\nEvaluate against Supporting Criteria\n\nConsider the Consideration Factors\n\nDetermine appropriate classification, using \"Maybe\" when genuine uncertainty exists\n\n\nClassification Examples\n\n\n\"Yes\" example: A tool that specifically implements archaeological seriation algorithms, provides data visualization capabilities for archaeological contexts, and has documentation focused on research use cases\n\n\"Maybe\" example: A commercial GIS system with some archaeology-specific extensions but primarily designed for general geospatial work\n\n\"No\" example: A general-purpose database with no specific adaptations for historical research\n\n\nOutput Delivery\n\n\nPresent findings in a markdown fenced code block with quoted CSV\n\nInclude header row and single data row\n\nFormat multiple values within cells with pipe (|) separators\n\nEnsure CSV is properly escaped and formatted as a single continuous line\n\nDo not include any inline citations or references in the CSV itself\n\n\nFor CSV formatting:\n\n\nDouble quotes within fields must be escaped as two double quotes (\"\")\n\nEnsure no newlines appear within any field\n\nFor fields containing commas, ensure the entire field is properly quoted\n\n\nExample Output Format\n\n\n\"Tool\",\"Description\",\"History\",\"Access-date\",\"Tool-status\",...\n\"ToolName\",\"This tool currently provides...\",\"Initially developed in 2010, the tool underwent major revisions in 2015 and 2022...\",\"2025-05-02\",\"maybe\",..."
