      "say": "Hello - Today we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools.\n\n\nGround rules\n\n\nABOVE ALL ELSE, if you are unsure about something, or do not have evidence from a web page supporting a claim, do not make a claim. If there is any doubt, there is no doubt.\n\n\nThis is research. SPEND EXTRA TIME above and beyond normal, to collect data carefully and methodically. We don't care about how long it takes, only that your research is accurate and epistemologically grounded. Care and attention to detail second only to the prior rule.\n\n\nResearch Software Tool Definition\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nResearch software tools are specialized digital instruments developed to generate, process, and analyze results throughout the scientific research lifecycle, ranging from sophisticated packages with broad user bases to targeted scripts created by individual researchers. These tools embody encoded scientific knowledge and methodological approaches that transform raw data into research insights, making them fundamental yet often underrecognized contributors to scientific discovery. Unlike general-purpose software, research software tools integrate domain expertise, directly impact research reproducibility, and require ongoing maintenance to adapt to changing computational environments and evolving research questions.\n\n\nI'd be happy to develop a comprehensive definition of a 'research software tool' based on the document you've shared and my knowledge of research software.\n\n\nDefining Research Software Tools\n\n\nA research software tool is specialized software that enables, enhances, or accelerates the scientific research process by supporting one or more stages of scientific inquiry, from hypothesis generation to data collection, analysis, visualization, and publication of results.\n\n\nCore Characteristics\n\n\nBased on the Hettrick report and broader understanding of the research software ecosystem, I would define research software tools by these essential characteristics:\n\n\nResearch-Oriented Purpose: Developed specifically to \"generate, process and analyze results\" in a research context, as noted in the report's definition section (3.1).\n\nFunctional Spectrum: Ranges from \"highly developed packages with significant user bases to short (tens of lines of code) programs written by researchers for their own use.\"\n\nKnowledge Embodiment: Represents encoded scientific knowledge and methodological approaches that enable specific kinds of research inquiries.\n\nLifecycle Variability: May exist at different development stages - from early prototype code developed by a single researcher to mature software maintained by dedicated teams and used across multiple disciplines.\n\nValue Chain Position: Serves as critical infrastructure that sits between raw data and research insights, making it a fundamental but often invisible contributor to scientific discovery.\n\n\nDistinguishing Features\n\n\nWhat separates research software tools from general software:\n\n\nSpecialized Functionality: Addresses specific scientific needs rather than general computing tasks.\n\nDomain Knowledge Integration: Embeds disciplinary expertise and methodological approaches within its functionality.\n\nEvolving Requirements: Often develops organically alongside research processes, with features added as research questions evolve.\n\nReproducibility Role: Directly impacts the reproducibility and reliability of research results, creating a direct link between software quality and research integrity.\n\nDevelopment Context: Often created in academic environments under different constraints and incentives than commercial software.\n\n\nCategories and Examples\n\n\nResearch software tools typically fall into these categories:\n\n\nData Collection Tools: Software for gathering, recording, or generating research data\n\n\nLaboratory instrument control systems\n\nSurvey platforms\n\nSimulation frameworks\n\nAnalysis Tools: Software that processes, transforms, or derives insights from research data\n\n\nStatistical analysis packages\n\nComputational modeling environments\n\nMachine learning frameworks customized for research applications\n\nVisualization Tools: Software for representing data or results visually\n\n\nScientific plotting libraries\n\nInteractive data exploration environments\n\nSpecialized visualization software for particular data types\n\nResearch Infrastructure Tools: Software that supports the research process itself\n\n\nElectronic lab notebooks\n\nResearch data management systems\n\nWorkflow management systems\n\n\nSustainability Considerations\n\n\nThe definition of research software tools must acknowledge their sustainability challenges:\n\n\nSustainability Requirements: Requires ongoing effort to maintain functionality in changing computing environments, as the report notes that \"a constant level of effort is required to maintain the software's operation.\"\n\nDependency Management: Exists within a complex \"pyramid or stack\" of dependencies that creates sustainability challenges as underlying software changes.\n\nResource Constraints: Often developed with limited resources and without explicit sustainability planning.\n\nPreservation Challenges: Presents unique preservation difficulties compared to data, as software \"must evolve and adapt to the constant changes in its environment\" rather than remaining static.\n\n\nThis definition emphasizes that research software tools are not merely technical artifacts but essential components of the research infrastructure that embody scientific knowledge, enable discovery, and deserve recognition and investment proportional to their critical role in advancing research.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIn essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only supports research in archaeology or historical sciences but does so by actively working with data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository, collection of information, or static interface.\n\n\nIt is our belief that the tools we have given you meet this criteria, however, if there is an absence of evidence supporting our belief, it is REQUIRED that you inform us of any problems. IF YOU ARE UNSURE, INDICATE IT rather than giving an answer.\n\n\nTask\n\n\nI will be giving you the name or acronym of an archaeology and historical studies-related software tool that dates somewhere from 1995 onwards.\n\n\nYou must build a well-formed quoted CSV inside a fenced code block with the following columns:\ncsv\n\"Tool\", \"Description\", \"Tool-status\", \"Tool-status-reasoning\", \"DVCS-repo\", \"CRAN\", \"PyPi\", \"Other-URL\", \"Category\", \"Language\", 'Platform\", \"License\", \"Type\", \"Lifecycle-stage\", \"Interoperability\", \"Strenghths\", \"Weaknesses\", \"Survivability\", \"Alternatives\", \"Authors\", \"Tags\"\n\n\nTool is our key column.
