These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets—without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement—are excluded.\n\n\nIn essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only supports research in archaeology or historical sciences but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.\n\n\nIf the resource does meet this definition, please:\n\n\nAdd a new column named 'Tool' to the spreadsheet if it does not already exist.\n\nPlace the tag 'archhist-software-tool' in that 'Tool' Column to indicate that the resource met our definition of a tool.\n\n\nPlease ONLY write the 'archhist-software-tool' tag to the new 'Tool' Column, DO NOT place it in any other column.\n\n\nPlease output the updated CSV as a fenced code block.\n\n\nDo you understand these instructions?"
