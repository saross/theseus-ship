I'm just\u2026 there\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:06:18\nBut also, the other thing with Gemini, the fact that the large model doesn't have web search is kind of a, you know, like, for any kind of bibliography thing, and it's, um\u2026 Training data isn't particularly recent. It had the oldest cutoff threat date of any of the major\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:06:31\nYeah, but it\u2026 Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say that this is particularly relevant Uh, because, like, that's just a moving target.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:06:46\nYeah, that's fine, not a big deal.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:06:50\nOkay, and then it just did additional, so we're just going to drop that in as an additional.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:06:56\nYeah. So that\u2026 that's a good\u2026 pull up, uh, some additional\u2026 Okay, we are\u2026 Two questions left. We can do this.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:08\nSure.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:07:09\nCrushed and tired. Um.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:07:17\nSo, this is the\u2026 this is the everything else Question\u2026 Um.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:07:28\nDid you have\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:29\nSo, if you want to do the hugging Face thing first, I can just\u2026 because I've been using some of the output from the Hugging Face thing.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:07:36\nYeah, so that'll be important to talk about then.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:38\nRight, yeah. So\u2026 Uh, I\u2026 so about the Hugging Face, uh, you know, output, there are\u2026 there are a number of hallucinations.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:49\nUm, I don't have the list in front of me right now, but They're just\u2026 there are tools that it says exist that just don't exist.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:58\nAnd it made them up, because Hugging Face, you use to discover the tools, is that right? That's the\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:03\nOkay, so\u2026 so we need to be really\u2026 the only Hugging Face run I ran was the, uh, elaboration of Open Archio.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:16\nElaboration of Open Archio.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:18\nSo, the tagging, uh, the tagging and descriptions of Open Archaea.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:23\nOh, okay. All right. No, I thought you used it for something else. Scratch, scratch everything I just said, don't, don't\u2026 worry about that, then.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:29\nYeah, yeah. I'm like\u2026 Like, let's be clear, a bunch of the models confabulated like hell when trying to find Um, but that's\u2026 News at 11, right?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:42\nYeah. Yeah, so\u2026 so you used it to\u2026 But, uh, I'm trying to remember exactly what that script\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:51\nSo, I dropped in the Open Archaeo CSV and had it build on it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:56\nAnd did you have it look for, like, instances of the tool, or did you have it\u2026 I can't remember exactly what you did.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:09:02\nNo, this was purely annotating, uh, building out better description. I\u2026 yes, because\u2026 because we decided that the GitHub iterator would be a much better way of looking for instances.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:07\nAh, okay. Yeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:17\nRight. I do want to compare the GitHub iterator to the Uh, for things that weren't in GitHub, like looking at other courses, and then using the overlap to check them, but that's besides the point, right?\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:09:26\nYeah. But that's for the other paper. That's not for this one.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:32\nYeah, that's the other paper. So\u2026 Um, I didn't find\u2026 so, it has\u2026 what I would say with that, like, I was this\u2026 dissatisfied with the elaborator thing that he, like, I didn't find it that\u2026 and that was, I think, why I initially set up the, um.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:52\nThe Claude research finds metadata about the tool. Thing. Um, because there are a bunch more tools we needed to do anyway, and I'm finding that I get much better results. It was a bit shallow, I thought.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:05\nUm, I would need to go back and look at the out\u2026 what, again, is that in, um\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:12\nThat's the Open Deep Archio, um, in repo.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:18\nOkay, open\u2026 DR Open\u2026 I see the prompt\u2026 It's not in the, um, uh, it's not\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:19\nOr, no, it's\u2026 I don't know. No, no, no, it's\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:30\nNo, it's on\u2026 it's\u2026 it is\u2026 Open Deep Research, Open Archaeo iterator.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:35\nOn GitHub.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:37\nJust open on your screen, since you're sharing it with me anyway, the\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:40\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:47\nYeah, I very trivially\u2026 Um, I very trivially reproduced this in in quad research, and then got it to do a bunch more things.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:00\nAnd so, basically. There was no particular\u2026 like, because this, like\u2026 and did Cloud Research iterate properly?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:00\nUh, the\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:09\nUh, no, I have to run it one tool at a time. That's the disadvantage. The advantage of this.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:14\nOh my god.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:16\nThe advantage, and there's, uh, and there's, um\u2026 And Anthropic, like\u2026 uh, um\u2026 OpenAI, don't\u2026 don't put their research model on their API. Like, you can't, like, use it this way. You have to\u2026 kind of sort of approximate it, but when I was doing some, you know, looking at that, and\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:39\nYou know, asking Claude for the code to approximate it sort of thing, there were just a bunch of warnings that it doesn't really work\u2026 that\u2026 that you can't\u2026 you can't make it do the deep research, or the, you know, the research thing the way that you can do the research thing through the, um.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:56\nChatbot. So\u2026 So, I run in\u2026 yeah, so the advantage, you know, so what I\u2026 so a better, let's say, a more balanced, uh, thing.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:58\nOkay.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:05\nStarting over. This is so\u2026 so, open deep research. We didn't find that the expense was particularly worth it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:06\nThat\u2026 yeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:14\nUm\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:15\nUh, it\u2026 it\u2026 It's like 60% of what you get out of a chatbot, but you can do it from\u2026 you can script it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:24\nUm, so\u2026 I got, I got one.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:26\nSo, no, that's normal.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:28\nYeah, I got what I would consider, you know, uh\u2026 significantly better results from, you know.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:36\nRight, okay.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:37\nUh, starting with that, you know, this was the prompt that I mostly started with and refined on, and got much better results through the chatbot.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:44\nI mean, to be fair, I had it\u2026 Like, the prompt that I was using was a build-out description prompt.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:55\nSo, like, we definitely, um\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:56\nYeah, I started with this prompt, and then iterated over it through the UI, and, uh, you know, sorry, through the chatbot, and looked at results, and did the process that I described a few minutes ago.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:15\nYeah, so the prompt that Open Deep Archaio used is this one.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:20\nRight? So, so this\u2026 I was asking for improved description and decide if the toolbath applied.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:27\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:28\nSo, was the issue that we were solving different problems? Did I miss that?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:34\nUh, mine grew\u2026 when I started to see\u2026 so, how to\u2026 how to explain this?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:39\nWhen I started with this. All of them, you know, 03, and Claude, and Gemini, they all wanted to do more than this.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:48\nAnd this is, uh, something you noted, I think, you know, 03 is probably the worst, because, you know, a bit that\u2026 you know, you ask them to do this, and then they start doing comparisons, and they start doing, you know, these other things.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:55\nIt doesn't shut up.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:14:01\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:02\nUh, and then I thought, alright, well, if they wanted, you know, if\u2026 some of the things they did, I thought, oh, that would be interesting to know.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:11\nAnd then I'm like, oh, and if I know that, then I probably also want to know something else. So I guess what I would say is.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:18\nThat this approach, and probably the way I present it in the paper.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:23\nUm, has a lot of potential for its efficiency. Um, and that we weren't getting, you know, we were getting much more out of the chatbots, partly because you can iter\u2026 it's a bit\u2026 We\u2026 or at least for me, I spent more time iterating over it and developing the prompt and that kind of thing, and I'm not\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:14:41\nYeah, I didn't iterate this prompt at all.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:44\nRight. So, you know, I would say that this has\u2026 you know, I probably positioned it in the paper that this has, um It has potential, uh, but it, you know, um, and that we're going to explore it more in a future\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:58\nYou know, in the future.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:00\nGreat. I am happy with that answer. Okay, and then the other question\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:10\nOther tools. Um\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:10\nYeah, I think we've got to just cut our\u2026 cut our losses at some point, and we say, we will look into this late, again, but it initially promising, but needs work.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:16\nYeah. Yeah, it's promising, but it would\u2026 it is very expensive to iterate on.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:25\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:27\nUm, so operator, uh, tech demo, not impressive. Computer use, even more tech demo, not impressive.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:34\nEllipse it, hobbled by some\u2026 All right.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:35\nUh, well, this one, I've just been working on this, and I can tell you a little bit more about illicit and Perplexity.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:42\nGreat.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:43\nUh, second\u2026 Okay, so\u2026 Um, elicit, I got a total of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 useful sources, as opposed to deep research, I got, like.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:57\nHow many? 55 sources.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:01\nYou know\u2026 Actually, I did find, with perplexities a bit infuriating.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:01\nYeah, that sounds about right.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:09\nI thought I only had 3 sources, because when I asked it for an actual citation of sources, it gave me 3.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:17\nBut then I looked a little more closely, and it's like, I analyzed 25 sources, and actually there's about 13 that are done in the stupid internals, um, thing, and I'm\u2026 I'm assessing them now.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:28\nUm, it looks like there might\u2026 I might end up with a dozen.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:33\nUseful sources, and I can also tell you, um\u2026 The illicit ones.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:39\nLet me look at them\u2026 Uh, I'm seeing how many\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:42\nI mean, illicit has the critical issue of semantic scholar.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:47\nUh-huh.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:51\nIt's just hobbled by Symmetric scholar.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:54\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:59\nUm.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:59\nFelicit sources only\u2026 I see only one of them was picked up by one of the other kinds of search, but the\u2026 The other\u2026 but they're not\u2026 they're not what I'd call first tier, so they're not the kind of sources that are going to shape our paper. They're\u2026 they're, like, sort of useful on the margins.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:18\nBut not\u2026 it's not just the quantity of sources. The quality of sources was the lowest.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:27\nOf the different approaches. Um, perplexity at least hit some of the major ones, like the Endings Project and Fading Away the Challenge, Sustainability and Digital Studies, which was another big one.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:40\nLike, I mean, deep research also got those. Um, I think I only got\u2026 I got a couple of papers that look like they might be really\u2026 well, one was a web page, interestingly, but by a researcher.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:17:45\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:57\nUh, on the desks of digital scholarship, uh, that is a case study of, um, the lifespan of digital projects, not software specifically.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:08\nUm, and that, that was actually quite interesting. So, Perplexity threw up a couple of things that I wouldn't have found otherwise.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:16\nBut it, again, it, you know. You're not going to write a paper based on the results of elicitor perplexity.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:24\nYou can write a paper based on the results of deep research. Like, not it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:32\nReport that it writes, but the sources. That it finds.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:18:34\nGreat. I am\n\n"

(Focus on what makes them distinct or reinforces the broader patterns you've observed).\n\n\\subsection{Response}\n\nOpen Deep Research's singular specific utility was in the ability to both interact with my filesystem and user-specificed search APIs plus running queries and operations from my local university computer. This was *significant* because I could give it a CSV of Open Archaeology tools and tell it to \"improve the description\" of each one. That run also cost \\$200 in o1-pro credits. We could, at even greater expense than our normal monthly spend, iterate over  structued data. It is clear that we could extend it with the model context protocol and wire it in to even better tools, academic databases, and the like -- but the cost per-run is insane. This implies *why* the designers of the web-based services chose not to be as systematic as we wanted. \n\nWe only had 1 major run with Open Deep Research, mostly due to the expense. Having it choose the level of model for each query could help mitigate this, and future papers could investigate implementing our workflow along these lines. Thereis no secret sauce to a \"deep research\" workflow, just agent-calling. PyDantic's AI framework has a tool-calling graph design that also shows promise in this direction. However, all of these are tool-using instances, not goal-following. \n\n\\subsection{For OpenAI's Operator, Anthropic's Computer Use, Elicit, Perplexity}\n\nOperator is a tech demo. Because it doesn't decompose its tasks, take notes, and work to a plan, it can't maintain context on even simple data collection tasks, much less broader research tasks where the automation would be useful. The idea that it can eventually navigate a web browser as an \"agent\" for the user is promising (though any direct MCP integrations are just going to be better and more legible for the systems), but the tooling isn't there yet. \n\nComputer Use, running on a local docker container, offers more promise around what programs can be used. But it was even more expensive and didn't even manage to get through a single task of \"go find a paper and load it.\" The fact that it runs in a container on the local computer is fantastic (though expensive in API credits) -- but again, this is a tech demo rather than anything persuasive.\n\nElicit uses a bad model and is hamstrung by its use of Semantic Scholar. While the even-more=expensive version might be promising in its \"systematic reports\" -- the data source quality and the indifferent amount of inference it runs  means that the paper-discovery, then paper-winnowing steps are flawed. If we could use the model of our choice, and hook it to web of science or google scholar, the steps it outlines in paper selection and evaluation are markedly *better* than all the other services: its technology choice lets it down.\n\nPerplexity's average amongst this lower-grade bunch. It runs a small amount of reasoning, does not have excellent access to the academic literature, and produces results of ignorable quality. Clearly they designed their \"research\" project for a different use case than the one we were assessing. Again, it is the lack of systematicity and conscientiousness, plus the sub-par model chocie, plus the data quality that hamstring this for our purposes. If a user simply wants a trivial digestion of a few sites  for a slightly more thorough search-result analogue, it's adequate. Perplexity clearly has spent more focus on optimising its search queries than the others (if only because it shows them to the user) -- but there's no evidence of triangualtion or taking any of the sources critically: another perfect example of technoscholasticism.  \n"

This capability proved significant in our testing, enabling us to process a CSV of Open Archaeology tools to enhance their descriptions. However, this capability came at substantial cost\u2014the single productive run required approximately $200 in O1-Pro API credits.\n\nThe primary value proposition of Open Deep Research lies in its extensibility potential. The infrastructure could theoretically connect to academic databases and specialized research tools through the Model Context Protocol, offering a systematic approach to research tasks. This extensibility, however, reveals why commercial web-based services likely chose less systematic approaches\u2014the expense per run proves prohibitive for regular usage.\n\nOur limited testing (one major run) suggests that future implementations might benefit from dynamic model selection per query to mitigate costs. While frameworks like PyDantic's AI tool-calling graph design show promise for similar implementations, our findings reinforce that these remain tool-using rather than goal-following systems. Open Deep Research ultimately confirms our central thesis: these",

I'm just\u2026 there\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:06:18\nBut also, the other thing with Gemini, the fact that the large model doesn't have web search is kind of a, you know, like, for any kind of bibliography thing, and it's, um\u2026 Training data isn't particularly recent. It had the oldest cutoff threat date of any of the major\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:06:31\nYeah, but it\u2026 Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say that this is particularly relevant Uh, because, like, that's just a moving target.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:06:46\nYeah, that's fine, not a big deal.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:06:50\nOkay, and then it just did additional, so we're just going to drop that in as an additional.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:06:56\nYeah. So that\u2026 that's a good\u2026 pull up, uh, some additional\u2026 Okay, we are\u2026 Two questions left. We can do this.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:08\nSure.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:07:09\nCrushed and tired. Um.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:07:17\nSo, this is the\u2026 this is the everything else Question\u2026 Um.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:07:28\nDid you have\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:29\nSo, if you want to do the hugging Face thing first, I can just\u2026 because I've been using some of the output from the Hugging Face thing.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:07:36\nYeah, so that'll be important to talk about then.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:38\nRight, yeah. So\u2026 Uh, I\u2026 so about the Hugging Face, uh, you know, output, there are\u2026 there are a number of hallucinations.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:49\nUm, I don't have the list in front of me right now, but They're just\u2026 there are tools that it says exist that just don't exist.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:58\nAnd it made them up, because Hugging Face, you use to discover the tools, is that right? That's the\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:03\nOkay, so\u2026 so we need to be really\u2026 the only Hugging Face run I ran was the, uh, elaboration of Open Archio.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:16\nElaboration of Open Archio.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:18\nSo, the tagging, uh, the tagging and descriptions of Open Archaea.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:23\nOh, okay. All right. No, I thought you used it for something else. Scratch, scratch everything I just said, don't, don't\u2026 worry about that, then.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:29\nYeah, yeah. I'm like\u2026 Like, let's be clear, a bunch of the models confabulated like hell when trying to find Um, but that's\u2026 News at 11, right?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:42\nYeah. Yeah, so\u2026 so you used it to\u2026 But, uh, I'm trying to remember exactly what that script\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:51\nSo, I dropped in the Open Archaeo CSV and had it build on it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:56\nAnd did you have it look for, like, instances of the tool, or did you have it\u2026 I can't remember exactly what you did.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:09:02\nNo, this was purely annotating, uh, building out better description. I\u2026 yes, because\u2026 because we decided that the GitHub iterator would be a much better way of looking for instances.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:07\nAh, okay. Yeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:17\nRight. I do want to compare the GitHub iterator to the Uh, for things that weren't in GitHub, like looking at other courses, and then using the overlap to check them, but that's besides the point, right?\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:09:26\nYeah. But that's for the other paper. That's not for this one.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:32\nYeah, that's the other paper. So\u2026 Um, I didn't find\u2026 so, it has\u2026 what I would say with that, like, I was this\u2026 dissatisfied with the elaborator thing that he, like, I didn't find it that\u2026 and that was, I think, why I initially set up the, um.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:52\nThe Claude research finds metadata about the tool. Thing. Um, because there are a bunch more tools we needed to do anyway, and I'm finding that I get much better results. It was a bit shallow, I thought.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:05\nUm, I would need to go back and look at the out\u2026 what, again, is that in, um\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:12\nThat's the Open Deep Archio, um, in repo.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:18\nOkay, open\u2026 DR Open\u2026 I see the prompt\u2026 It's not in the, um, uh, it's not\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:19\nOr, no, it's\u2026 I don't know. No, no, no, it's\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:30\nNo, it's on\u2026 it's\u2026 it is\u2026 Open Deep Research, Open Archaeo iterator.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:35\nOn GitHub.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:37\nJust open on your screen, since you're sharing it with me anyway, the\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:40\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:47\nYeah, I very trivially\u2026 Um, I very trivially reproduced this in in quad research, and then got it to do a bunch more things.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:00\nAnd so, basically. There was no particular\u2026 like, because this, like\u2026 and did Cloud Research iterate properly?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:00\nUh, the\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:09\nUh, no, I have to run it one tool at a time. That's the disadvantage. The advantage of this.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:14\nOh my god.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:16\nThe advantage, and there's, uh, and there's, um\u2026 And Anthropic, like\u2026 uh, um\u2026 OpenAI, don't\u2026 don't put their research model on their API. Like, you can't, like, use it this way. You have to\u2026 kind of sort of approximate it, but when I was doing some, you know, looking at that, and\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:39\nYou know, asking Claude for the code to approximate it sort of thing, there were just a bunch of warnings that it doesn't really work\u2026 that\u2026 that you can't\u2026 you can't make it do the deep research, or the, you know, the research thing the way that you can do the research thing through the, um.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:56\nChatbot. So\u2026 So, I run in\u2026 yeah, so the advantage, you know, so what I\u2026 so a better, let's say, a more balanced, uh, thing.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:58\nOkay.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:05\nStarting over. This is so\u2026 so, open deep research. We didn't find that the expense was particularly worth it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:06\nThat\u2026 yeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:14\nUm\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:15\nUh, it\u2026 it\u2026 It's like 60% of what you get out of a chatbot, but you can do it from\u2026 you can script it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:24\nUm, so\u2026 I got, I got one.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:26\nSo, no, that's normal.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:28\nYeah, I got what I would consider, you know, uh\u2026 significantly better results from, you know.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:36\nRight, okay.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:37\nUh, starting with that, you know, this was the prompt that I mostly started with and refined on, and got much better results through the chatbot.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:44\nI mean, to be fair, I had it\u2026 Like, the prompt that I was using was a build-out description prompt.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:55\nSo, like, we definitely, um\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:56\nYeah, I started with this prompt, and then iterated over it through the UI, and, uh, you know, sorry, through the chatbot, and looked at results, and did the process that I described a few minutes ago.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:15\nYeah, so the prompt that Open Deep Archaio used is this one.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:20\nRight? So, so this\u2026 I was asking for improved description and decide if the toolbath applied.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:27\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:28\nSo, was the issue that we were solving different problems? Did I miss that?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:34\nUh, mine grew\u2026 when I started to see\u2026 so, how to\u2026 how to explain this?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:39\nWhen I started with this. All of them, you know, 03, and Claude, and Gemini, they all wanted to do more than this.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:48\nAnd this is, uh, something you noted, I think, you know, 03 is probably the worst, because, you know, a bit that\u2026 you know, you ask them to do this, and then they start doing comparisons, and they start doing, you know, these other things.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:55\nIt doesn't shut up.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:14:01\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:02\nUh, and then I thought, alright, well, if they wanted, you know, if\u2026 some of the things they did, I thought, oh, that would be interesting to know.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:11\nAnd then I'm like, oh, and if I know that, then I probably also want to know something else. So I guess what I would say is.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:18\nThat this approach, and probably the way I present it in the paper.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:23\nUm, has a lot of potential for its efficiency. Um, and that we weren't getting, you know, we were getting much more out of the chatbots, partly because you can iter\u2026 it's a bit\u2026 We\u2026 or at least for me, I spent more time iterating over it and developing the prompt and that kind of thing, and I'm not\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:14:41\nYeah, I didn't iterate this prompt at all.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:44\nRight. So, you know, I would say that this has\u2026 you know, I probably positioned it in the paper that this has, um It has potential, uh, but it, you know, um, and that we're going to explore it more in a future\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:58\nYou know, in the future.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:00\nGreat. I am happy with that answer. Okay, and then the other question\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:10\nOther tools.

Yeah, it's promising, but it would\u2026 it is very expensive to iterate on.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:25\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:27\nUm, so operator, uh, tech demo, not impressive. Computer use, even more tech demo, not impressive.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:34\nEllipse it, hobbled by some\u2026 All right.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:35\nUh, well, this one, I've just been working on this, and I can tell you a little bit more about illicit and Perplexity.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:42\nGreat.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:43\nUh, second\u2026 Okay, so\u2026 Um, elicit, I got a total of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 useful sources, as opposed to deep research, I got, like.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:57\nHow many? 55 sources.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:01\nYou know\u2026 Actually, I did find, with perplexities a bit infuriating.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:01\nYeah, that sounds about right.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:09\nI thought I only had 3 sources, because when I asked it for an actual citation of sources, it gave me 3.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:17\nBut then I looked a little more closely, and it's like, I analyzed 25 sources, and actually there's about 13 that are done in the stupid internals, um, thing, and I'm\u2026 I'm assessing them now.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:28\nUm, it looks like there might\u2026 I might end up with a dozen.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:33\nUseful sources, and I can also tell you, um\u2026 The illicit ones.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:39\nLet me look at them\u2026 Uh, I'm seeing how many\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:42\nI mean, illicit has the critical issue of semantic scholar.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:47\nUh-huh.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:51\nIt's just hobbled by Symmetric scholar.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:54\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:59\nUm.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:59\nFelicit sources only\u2026 I see only one of them was picked up by one of the other kinds of search, but the\u2026 The other\u2026 but they're not\u2026 they're not what I'd call first tier, so they're not the kind of sources that are going to shape our paper. They're\u2026 they're, like, sort of useful on the margins.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:18\nBut not\u2026 it's not just the quantity of sources. The quality of sources was the lowest.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:27\nOf the different approaches. Um, perplexity at least hit some of the major ones, like the Endings Project and Fading Away the Challenge, Sustainability and Digital Studies, which was another big one.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:40\nLike, I mean, deep research also got those. Um, I think I only got\u2026 I got a couple of papers that look like they might be really\u2026 well, one was a web page, interestingly, but by a researcher.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:17:45\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:57\nUh, on the desks of digital scholarship, uh, that is a case study of, um, the lifespan of digital projects, not software specifically.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:08\nUm, and that, that was actually quite interesting. So, Perplexity threw up a couple of things that I wouldn't have found otherwise.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:16\nBut it, again, it, you know. You're not going to write a paper based on the results of elicitor perplexity.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:24\nYou can write a paper based on the results of deep research. Like, not it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:32\nReport that it writes, but the sources. That it finds.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:18:34\nGreat. I am\n\n"

How did their performance, particularly in their attempts at \"agentic\" or research-oriented tasks, compare to the more prominent Deep Research implementations from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google? (Focus on what makes them distinct or reinforces the broader patterns you've observed).\n\n\\subsection{Response}\n\nOpen Deep Research's singular specific utility was in the ability to both interact with my filesystem and user-specificed search APIs plus running queries and operations from my local university computer. This was *significant* because I could give it a CSV of Open Archaeology tools and tell it to \"improve the description\" of each one. That run also cost \\$200 in o1-pro credits. We could, at even greater expense than our normal monthly spend, iterate over  structued data. It is clear that we could extend it with the model context protocol and wire it in to even better tools, academic databases, and the like -- but the cost per-run is insane. This implies *why* the designers of the web-based services chose not to be as systematic as we wanted. \n\nWe only had 1 major run with Open Deep Research, mostly due to the expense. Having it choose the level of model for each query could help mitigate this, and future papers could investigate implementing our workflow along these lines. Thereis no secret sauce to a \"deep research\" workflow, just agent-calling. PyDantic's AI framework has a tool-calling graph design that also shows promise in this direction. However, all of these are tool-using instances, not goal-following. \n\n\\subsection{For OpenAI's Operator, Anthropic's Computer Use, Elicit, Perplexity}\n\nOperator is a tech demo. Because it doesn't decompose its tasks, take notes, and work to a plan, it can't maintain context on even simple data collection tasks, much less broader research tasks where the automation would be useful. The idea that it can eventually navigate a web browser as an \"agent\" for the user is promising (though any direct MCP integrations are just going to be better and more legible for the systems), but the tooling isn't there yet. \n\nComputer Use, running on a local docker container, offers more promise around what programs can be used. But it was even more expensive and didn't even manage to get through a single task of \"go find a paper and load it.\" The fact that it runs in a container on the local computer is fantastic (though expensive in API credits) -- but again, this is a tech demo rather than anything persuasive.\n\nElicit uses a bad model and is hamstrung by its use of Semantic Scholar. While the even-more=expensive version might be promising in its \"systematic reports\" -- the data source quality and the indifferent amount of inference it runs  means that the paper-discovery, then paper-winnowing steps are flawed. If we could use the model of our choice, and hook it to web of science or google scholar, the steps it outlines in paper selection and evaluation are markedly *better* than all the other services: its technology choice lets it down.\n\nPerplexity's average amongst this lower-grade bunch. It runs a small amount of reasoning, does not have excellent access to the academic literature, and produces results of ignorable quality. Clearly they designed their \"research\" project for a different use case than the one we were assessing. Again, it is the lack of systematicity and conscientiousness, plus the sub-par model chocie, plus the data quality that hamstring this for our purposes. If a user simply wants a trivial digestion of a few sites  for a slightly more thorough search-result analogue, it's adequate. Perplexity clearly has spent more focus on optimising its search queries than the others (if only because it shows them to the user) -- but there's no evidence of triangualtion or taking any of the sources critically: another perfect example of technoscholasticism.  \n"

So\u2026 Uh, I\u2026 so about the Hugging Face, uh, you know, output, there are\u2026 there are a number of hallucinations.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:49\nUm, I don't have the list in front of me right now, but They're just\u2026 there are tools that it says exist that just don't exist.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:07:58\nAnd it made them up, because Hugging Face, you use to discover the tools, is that right? That's the\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:03\nOkay, so\u2026 so we need to be really\u2026 the only Hugging Face run I ran was the, uh, elaboration of Open Archio.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:16\nElaboration of Open Archio.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:18\nSo, the tagging, uh, the tagging and descriptions of Open Archaea.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:23\nOh, okay. All right. No, I thought you used it for something else. Scratch, scratch everything I just said, don't, don't\u2026 worry about that, then.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:29\nYeah, yeah. I'm like\u2026 Like, let's be clear, a bunch of the models confabulated like hell when trying to find Um, but that's\u2026 News at 11, right?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:42\nYeah. Yeah, so\u2026 so you used it to\u2026 But, uh, I'm trying to remember exactly what that script\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:08:51\nSo, I dropped in the Open Archaeo CSV and had it build on it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:08:56\nAnd did you have it look for, like, instances of the tool, or did you have it\u2026 I can't remember exactly what you did.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:09:02\nNo, this was purely annotating, uh, building out better description. I\u2026 yes, because\u2026 because we decided that the GitHub iterator would be a much better way of looking for instances.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:07\nAh, okay. Yeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:17\nRight. I do want to compare the GitHub iterator to the Uh, for things that weren't in GitHub, like looking at other courses, and then using the overlap to check them, but that's besides the point, right?\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:09:26\nYeah. But that's for the other paper. That's not for this one.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:32\nYeah, that's the other paper. So\u2026 Um, I didn't find\u2026 so, it has\u2026 what I would say with that, like, I was this\u2026 dissatisfied with the elaborator thing that he, like, I didn't find it that\u2026 and that was, I think, why I initially set up the, um.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:09:52\nThe Claude research finds metadata about the tool. Thing. Um, because there are a bunch more tools we needed to do anyway, and I'm finding that I get much better results. It was a bit shallow, I thought.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:05\nUm, I would need to go back and look at the out\u2026 what, again, is that in, um\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:12\nThat's the Open Deep Archio, um, in repo.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:18\nOkay, open\u2026 DR Open\u2026 I see the prompt\u2026 It's not in the, um, uh, it's not\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:19\nOr, no, it's\u2026 I don't know. No, no, no, it's\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:30\nNo, it's on\u2026 it's\u2026 it is\u2026 Open Deep Research, Open Archaeo iterator.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:35\nOn GitHub.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:37\nJust open on your screen, since you're sharing it with me anyway, the\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:10:40\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:10:47\nYeah, I very trivially\u2026 Um, I very trivially reproduced this in in quad research, and then got it to do a bunch more things.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:00\nAnd so, basically. There was no particular\u2026 like, because this, like\u2026 and did Cloud Research iterate properly?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:00\nUh, the\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:09\nUh, no, I have to run it one tool at a time. That's the disadvantage. The advantage of this.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:14\nOh my god.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:16\nThe advantage, and there's, uh, and there's, um\u2026 And Anthropic, like\u2026 uh, um\u2026 OpenAI, don't\u2026 don't put their research model on their API. Like, you can't, like, use it this way. You have to\u2026 kind of sort of approximate it, but when I was doing some, you know, looking at that, and\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:39\nYou know, asking Claude for the code to approximate it sort of thing, there were just a bunch of warnings that it doesn't really work\u2026 that\u2026 that you can't\u2026 you can't make it do the deep research, or the, you know, the research thing the way that you can do the research thing through the, um.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:11:56\nChatbot. So\u2026 So, I run in\u2026 yeah, so the advantage, you know, so what I\u2026 so a better, let's say, a more balanced, uh, thing.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:11:58\nOkay.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:05\nStarting over. This is so\u2026 so, open deep research. We didn't find that the expense was particularly worth it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:06\nThat\u2026 yeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:14\nUm\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:15\nUh, it\u2026 it\u2026 It's like 60% of what you get out of a chatbot, but you can do it from\u2026 you can script it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:24\nUm, so\u2026 I got, I got one.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:26\nSo, no, that's normal.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:28\nYeah, I got what I would consider, you know, uh\u2026 significantly better results from, you know.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:36\nRight, okay.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:37\nUh, starting with that, you know, this was the prompt that I mostly started with and refined on, and got much better results through the chatbot.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:44\nI mean, to be fair, I had it\u2026 Like, the prompt that I was using was a build-out description prompt.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:12:55\nSo, like, we definitely, um\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:12:56\nYeah, I started with this prompt, and then iterated over it through the UI, and, uh, you know, sorry, through the chatbot, and looked at results, and did the process that I described a few minutes ago.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:15\nYeah, so the prompt that Open Deep Archaio used is this one.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:20\nRight? So, so this\u2026 I was asking for improved description and decide if the toolbath applied.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:27\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:28\nSo, was the issue that we were solving different problems? Did I miss that?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:34\nUh, mine grew\u2026 when I started to see\u2026 so, how to\u2026 how to explain this?\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:39\nWhen I started with this. All of them, you know, 03, and Claude, and Gemini, they all wanted to do more than this.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:13:48\nAnd this is, uh, something you noted, I think, you know, 03 is probably the worst, because, you know, a bit that\u2026 you know, you ask them to do this, and then they start doing comparisons, and they start doing, you know, these other things.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:13:55\nIt doesn't shut up.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:14:01\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:02\nUh, and then I thought, alright, well, if they wanted, you know, if\u2026 some of the things they did, I thought, oh, that would be interesting to know.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:11\nAnd then I'm like, oh, and if I know that, then I probably also want to know something else. So I guess what I would say is.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:18\nThat this approach, and probably the way I present it in the paper.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:23\nUm, has a lot of potential for its efficiency. Um, and that we weren't getting, you know, we were getting much more out of the chatbots, partly because you can iter\u2026 it's a bit\u2026 We\u2026 or at least for me, I spent more time iterating over it and developing the prompt and that kind of thing, and I'm not\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:14:41\nYeah, I didn't iterate this prompt at all.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:44\nRight. So, you know, I would say that this has\u2026 you know, I probably positioned it in the paper that this has, um It has potential, uh, but it, you know, um, and that we're going to explore it more in a future\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:14:58\nYou know, in the future.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:00\nGreat. I am happy with that answer. Okay, and then the other question\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:10\nOther tools. Um\u2026\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:10\nYeah, I think we've got to just cut our\u2026 cut our losses at some point, and we say, we will look into this late, again, but it initially promising, but needs work.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:16\nYeah. Yeah, it's promising, but it would\u2026 it is very expensive to iterate on.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:25\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:27\nUm, so operator, uh, tech demo, not impressive. Computer use, even more tech demo, not impressive.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:34\nEllipse it, hobbled by some\u2026 All right.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:35\nUh, well, this one, I've just been working on this, and I can tell you a little bit more about illicit and Perplexity.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:15:42\nGreat.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:43\nUh, second\u2026 Okay, so\u2026 Um, elicit, I got a total of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 useful sources, as opposed to deep research, I got, like.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:15:57\nHow many? 55 sources.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:01\nYou know\u2026 Actually, I did find, with perplexities a bit infuriating.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:01\nYeah, that sounds about right.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:09\nI thought I only had 3 sources, because when I asked it for an actual citation of sources, it gave me 3.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:17\nBut then I looked a little more closely, and it's like, I analyzed 25 sources, and actually there's about 13 that are done in the stupid internals, um, thing, and I'm\u2026 I'm assessing them now.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:28\nUm, it looks like there might\u2026 I might end up with a dozen.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:33\nUseful sources, and I can also tell you, um\u2026 The illicit ones.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:39\nLet me look at them\u2026 Uh, I'm seeing how many\u2026\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:42\nI mean, illicit has the critical issue of semantic scholar.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:47\nUh-huh.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:51\nIt's just hobbled by Symmetric scholar.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:54\nYeah.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:16:59\nUm.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:16:59\nFelicit sources only\u2026 I see only one of them was picked up by one of the other kinds of search, but the\u2026 The other\u2026 but they're not\u2026 they're not what I'd call first tier, so they're not the kind of sources that are going to shape our paper. They're\u2026 they're, like, sort of useful on the margins.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:18\nBut not\u2026 it's not just the quantity of sources. The quality of sources was the lowest.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:27\nOf the different approaches. Um, perplexity at least hit some of the major ones, like the Endings Project and Fading Away the Challenge, Sustainability and Digital Studies, which was another big one.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:40\nLike, I mean, deep research also got those. Um, I think I only got\u2026 I got a couple of papers that look like they might be really\u2026 well, one was a web page, interestingly, but by a researcher.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:17:45\nYeah.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:17:57\nUh, on the desks of digital scholarship, uh, that is a case study of, um, the lifespan of digital projects, not software specifically.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:08\nUm, and that, that was actually quite interesting. So, Perplexity threw up a couple of things that I wouldn't have found otherwise.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:16\nBut it, again, it, you know. You're not going to write a paper based on the results of elicitor perplexity.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:24\nYou can write a paper based on the results of deep research. Like, not it.\n\n[Shawn Ross] 21:18:32\nReport that it writes, but the sources. That it finds.\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:18:34\nGreat. I am\n\n"

How did their performance, particularly in their attempts at \"agentic\" or research-oriented tasks, compare to the more prominent Deep Research implementations from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google? (Focus on what makes them distinct or reinforces the broader patterns you've observed).\n\n\\subsection{Response}\n\nOpen Deep Research's singular specific utility was in the ability to both interact with my filesystem and user-specificed search APIs plus running queries and operations from my local university computer. This was *significant* because I could give it a CSV of Open Archaeology tools and tell it to \"improve the description\" of each one. That run also cost \\$200 in o1-pro credits. We could, at even greater expense than our normal monthly spend, iterate over  structued data. It is clear that we could extend it with the model context protocol and wire it in to even better tools, academic databases, and the like -- but the cost per-run is insane. This implies *why* the designers of the web-based services chose not to be as systematic as we wanted. \n\nWe only had 1 major run with Open Deep Research, mostly due to the expense. Having it choose the level of model for each query could help mitigate this, and future papers could investigate implementing our workflow along these lines. Thereis no secret sauce to a \"deep research\" workflow, just agent-calling. PyDantic's AI framework has a tool-calling graph design that also shows promise in this direction. However, all of these are tool-using instances, not goal-following. \n\n\\subsection{For OpenAI's Operator, Anthropic's Computer Use, Elicit, Perplexity}\n\nOperator is a tech demo. Because it doesn't decompose its tasks, take notes, and work to a plan, it can't maintain context on even simple data collection tasks, much less broader research tasks where the automation would be useful. The idea that it can eventually navigate a web browser as an \"agent\" for the user is promising (though any direct MCP integrations are just going to be better and more legible for the systems), but the tooling isn't there yet. \n\nComputer Use, running on a local docker container, offers more promise around what programs can be used. But it was even more expensive and didn't even manage to get through a single task of \"go find a paper and load it.\" The fact that it runs in a container on the local computer is fantastic (though expensive in API credits) -- but again, this is a tech demo rather than anything persuasive.\n\nElicit uses a bad model and is hamstrung by its use of Semantic Scholar. While the even-more=expensive version might be promising in its \"systematic reports\" -- the data source quality and the indifferent amount of inference it runs  means that the paper-discovery, then paper-winnowing steps are flawed. If we could use the model of our choice, and hook it to web of science or google scholar, the steps it outlines in paper selection and evaluation are markedly *better* than all the other services: its technology choice lets it down.\n\nPerplexity's average amongst this lower-grade bunch. It runs a small amount of reasoning, does not have excellent access to the academic literature, and produces results of ignorable quality. Clearly they designed their \"research\" project for a different use case than the one we were assessing. Again, it is the lack of systematicity and conscientiousness, plus the sub-par model chocie, plus the data quality that hamstring this for our purposes. If a user simply wants a trivial digestion of a few sites  for a slightly more thorough search-result analogue, it's adequate. Perplexity clearly has spent more focus on optimising its search queries than the others (if only because it shows them to the user) -- but there's no evidence of triangualtion or taking any of the sources critically: another perfect example of technoscholasticism.  \n"

That's why I initially set up the Claude research to find metadata about the tools. I find that I get much better results through the chatbot interface.\n\n\\textbf{Brian:} I didn't iterate on the prompt at all for Open Deep Research.\n\n\\textbf{Shawn:} I very trivially reproduced this functionality in Claude Research, and then got it to do additional tasks. The disadvantage is I have to run it one tool at a time. Both OpenAI and Anthropic don't expose their research models through their APIs in the same way as through their chatbots.\n\n\\textbf{Brian:} So with Open Deep Research, we didn't find that the expense was particularly worth it.\n\n\\textbf{Shawn:} It's like 60\\% of what you get out of a chatbot, but you can script it. I got significantly better results from iterating on the prompt through the chatbot interface.\n\n\\textbf{Brian:} The prompt I used was specifically for improved descriptions and determining if the toolpath applied.\n\n\\textbf{Shawn:} When I started with this approach, all the models\u201403, Claude, and Gemini\u2014wanted to do more than just basic description. They started doing comparisons and additional analyses. I began incorporating these additional capabilities into my prompts.\n\n\\textbf{Brian:} So Open Deep Research has potential, but is very expensive to iterate on.\n\n\\textbf{Shawn:} Exactly.

Perplexity was initially frustrating\u2014when I asked for actual citations, it only provided 3, but it claimed to have analyzed 25 sources. Looking more closely at its internal references, I might end up with about a dozen useful sources.\n\n\\textbf{Brian:} Elicit has the critical issue of being hobbled by Semantic Scholar.\n\n\\textbf{Shawn:} The Elicit sources were only marginally useful\u2014just one was picked up by other search methods. It's not just the quantity but the quality was the lowest of the different approaches. Perplexity at least identified some major sources like the Endings Project and \"Fading Away the Challenge: Sustainability and Digital Studies,\" which Deep Research also found.\n\nPerplexity did surface a couple of things I wouldn't have found otherwise, like a researcher's web page on \"Desks of Digital Scholarship\" that examines the lifespan of digital projects, not software specifically.\n\nBut ultimately, you're not going to write a paper based on the results of Elicit or Perplexity alone. You could potentially write a paper based on the sources that Deep Research finds\u2014not the report it generates, but the actual sources it identifies.\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\section{Comparative Analysis from Formal Response}\n\n\\subsection{Open Deep Research}\nOpen Deep Research's singular specific utility was in the ability to both interact with the filesystem and user-specified search APIs plus running queries and operations from a local university computer. This was significant because it enabled giving a CSV of Open Archaeology tools with instructions to \"improve the description\" of each one. That run cost \\$200 in o1-pro credits. Structured data iteration was possible, but at even greater expense than normal monthly expenditure. It could potentially be extended with the model context protocol and connected to better tools and academic databases, but the cost per-run is prohibitive. This explains why web-based services chose less systematic approaches.\n\nOnly one major run with Open Deep Research was conducted, primarily due to expense. Model selection optimization for each query could help mitigate costs, and future papers could investigate implementing such workflows. There is no \"secret sauce\" to a \"deep research\" workflow\u2014just agent-calling. PyDantic's AI framework's tool-calling graph design shows promise in this direction, but all these remain tool-using instances rather than goal-following systems.\n\n\\subsection{Other Tools}\n\nOperator functions merely as a technology demonstration. Its inability to decompose tasks, take notes, and work to a plan prevents it from maintaining context even on simple data collection tasks, let alone broader research requiring automation. While the potential for browser navigation as a user \"agent\" is promising (though direct MCP integrations would be more effective and legible), the current tooling remains underdeveloped.\n\nComputer Use, operating via a local docker container, shows more promise regarding program accessibility. However, it proved even more expensive and failed to complete even a basic task of locating and loading a paper. Though running containerized on a local machine is advantageous (despite API credit costs), it remains a tech demo rather than a persuasive solution.\n\nElicit employs an inadequate model and suffers from Semantic Scholar limitations. While its systematic reports feature (at higher expense) shows potential, the paper-discovery and winnowing processes are compromised by data source quality and insufficient inference capabilities. With a superior model choice and integration with Web of Science or Google Scholar, its paper selection and evaluation methodology would substantially outperform competing services\u2014its technology choices are its primary limitation.\n\nPerplexity ranks as average among these lower-tier options. It performs minimal reasoning, lacks robust academic literature access, and produces results of negligible quality. Its \"research\" functionality appears designed for different use cases than scholarly assessment. The absence of systematicity and conscientiousness, combined with suboptimal model selection and data quality, undermines its utility for rigorous research. For users seeking basic digestion of a few sources\u2014essentially an enhanced search result\u2014it suffices. Perplexity has evidently focused more on search query optimization than its competitors (demonstrated by showing queries to users), but shows no evidence of triangulation or critical source assessment\u2014exemplifying technoscholasticism.\n",

(A short analytical answer, no log excerpts needed; I\u2019ll flag <<QUOTE-AN-Y>> for later sourcing.)\n\\subsection{Response}\nA minor increase in epistemic humility. At the start of its DH report it says: \"Knowledge gaps requiring further research include:\" and describes some live issues, though it is unclear if it has *described* these from extant sources, or has delivered this insight on its own. More to the point, it was more obedient, showing some \"cross-references\" for each source it articulated (let down only by the fact that those cross-references simply don't exist.) At least it tried.\nThis is why I claim that there is minor difference in quality (degree), but no fundamental difference (kind) between these three deployments. They all take roughly the same approach, and are different on the margins by virtue of the deccisions the programmers made plus the quality of their underlying models in regards to this task. The knowledge gaps identified seem like topics from the literature (none of them represent a genuine insight that I've not seen before) rather than... genuine insights. \n\n\n\n\n(to be synthesised with)\n\n\n\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:30:45\nSo, epistemic humility, inductive capacity, correspondence with reality. Um, so basically, we were talking about how the fact that its correspondence with reality Seems to be, uh, better because it does breadth-first searches with sub-agents.\n[Shawn Ross] 21:30:46\nQuestions.\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:31:02\nAnd again, it seems to get less distracted. Um, which is weird, because we would expect that Gemini uh, research to do even better, and yet\u2026 it\u2026 it feels like Gemini research just hits everything and just kind of\u2026 Meh? Whereas Claude\u2026\n[Shawn Ross] 21:31:23\nYeah, I don't know. I definitely\u2026 I definitely got\u2026 was able to, and I was doing these side-by-side as I was iterating over the quotes, and dropped models as they fell behind.\n[Shawn Ross] 21:31:36\nRight? And I was just getting more complete and accurate answers, no, you know, no\u2026 lies or confabulations, um\u2026 you know, and\u2026 and, you know, I was doing it over fames, and I just got, like, the\u2026 what Claude was producing was\n[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 21:31:36\nYeah.\n[Shawn Ross] 21:31:55\nWhat's the highest quality in terms of accuracy, completeness.

It also gets less distracted.\n\n\\textbf{Shawn:} When testing side-by-side and iterating over quotes, I dropped models as they fell behind. I was getting more complete and accurate answers from Claude, with fewer confabulations. When researching Fames, Claude produced the highest quality in terms of accuracy, completeness, and thoroughness.\n\nIt was also somewhat better on epistemic humility\u2014it would make optimistic but not ridiculous claims about capabilities. For instance, it would say \"if you want something thorough, I can do 1 to 3 tools,\" and when the prompt got longer, it advised \"don't do this on more than two tools.\" It explicitly warned about degraded performance, saying that with 10 tools, you'd get a shallow summary.\n\nThis contrasts with OpenAI Deep Research, which would claim it could do everything in the prompt but then sometimes just stop processing.\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\subsection{Formal Assessment of Judgment Dimensions}\n\nDespite these observations in testing, our formal assessment indicates only a minor increase in epistemic humility in Anthropic's tools. At the start of its Digital Humanities report, it does state \"Knowledge gaps requiring further research include:\" and describes some live issues, though it remains unclear whether it extracted these from existing sources or generated this insight independently. It was more obedient, showing \"cross-references\" for each source it articulated (undermined by the fact that those cross-references simply don't exist\u2014but at least it tried).\n\nThis supports our broader conclusion that there is minor difference in quality (degree), but no fundamental difference in kind between these three implementations. They all take roughly the same approach and differ only at the margins due to the decisions their programmers made and the underlying model quality. The knowledge gaps identified appear to be topics from the literature rather than genuine insights\u2014they represent information we've seen before in our research.\n\n\\section{Comparative Analysis from Formal Response}\n\n\\subsection{Open Deep Research}",

At the start of its Digital Humanities report, it explicitly acknowledges \"knowledge gaps requiring further research\" and describes several active issues in the field. While it remains unclear whether these gaps were extracted directly from sources or represented the model's own insights, the explicit acknowledgment of limitations represents an improvement in epistemic posture.\n\nMore significantly, Claude demonstrated observable improvements in correspondence with reality through its approach to information gathering and synthesis. Its multi-agent architecture enabled a breadth-first search pattern that appeared less prone to distraction and tangential exploration than OpenAI's implementation. As Shawn observed during comparative testing:\n\n\\begin{quote}\nI was doing these side-by-side as I was iterating over the prompts, and dropped models as they fell behind. I was getting more complete and accurate answers, with fewer confabulations from Claude...what it produced was consistently higher quality in terms of accuracy, completeness, and thoroughness.\n\\end{quote}\n\nThis improvement in reality correspondence was further evidenced by Claude's ability to provide more accurate contextual information about tools in our domain, including more thorough research on competing technologies.\n\nClaude also demonstrated marginally better epistemic humility in its operational capabilities assessment. Rather than making unrealistic claims about processing capacity:\n\n\\begin{quote}\nIt would make optimistic but not ridiculous claims about what it could do regarding how many tools it could research in a single run. It would say, \"If you want something thorough, I can do 1 to 3.\" When the prompt got longer, it explicitly warned me not to request more than two tools...It described how its performance would degrade, noting that with 10 tools, \"you're going to get a shallow summary.\"\n\\end{quote}\n\nThis contrasted with OpenAI Deep Research's tendency to uncritically accept all tasks regardless of scope: \"I'll go right out and do everything you say in your prompt,\" only to abandon processing without warning when exceeding capabilities.\n\nDespite these relative improvements, we maintain that the difference between these implementations remains one of degree rather than kind. All examined systems continue to demonstrate technoscholastic tendencies\u2014privileging textual authority over critical evaluation. The knowledge gaps identified by Claude appeared to be drawn from existing literature rather than representing genuine analytical insights, reinforcing our assessment that even the most advanced current implementations remain fundamentally limited in their judgment capacities.\n",
