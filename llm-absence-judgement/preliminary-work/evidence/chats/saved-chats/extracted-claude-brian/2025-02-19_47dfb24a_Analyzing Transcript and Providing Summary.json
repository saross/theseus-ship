          "extracted_content": "What follows is a transcript of an academic discussion that I was just engaged in. \n\nFirst, I would like you to make an outline of the salient points and discussion topics. Think deeply about this, as we've moved over many topics and returned to a few. This is not a timeline, but more a structured outline of the topic. Think very deeply about this, take as much time as you need. \n\nSecond, I would like you to structure this transcript as a series of Q&As for easy cross referencing. \n\nFinally, as an experiment, given the register in which I presented, keep that register and turn this into an essay or blog post, abstracting away the conversational interactions.\n\n<transcript>\nUnknown: I'm sorry, I thought we had done so. That's kind of why I just started. Yeah, no, hit record. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I wasn't sure if you had for me to stop, but I started. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.\n\nUnknown: I completely lost contact. On the road. So the philosophy of science stuff aside, there are places of pragmatic utility for...\n\nUnknown: computer aided tools in the process of journal preparations. And there are options for AI there as well. And I can show you some of the things that I've been doing. The one thing I do want to say on the record is deep research is going to, it should be changing your expectations for quality and standard of submission. But what I'd strongly encourage you folks to have a conversation about is what is the new currency of a contribution of knowledge?\n\nUnknown: Because\n\nUnknown: With OpenAI deep research, noting that this is a tool like any other, that prompting is a skill like any other, you're able to have DREC. And 80 to 90% of all outputs of this will be DREC, not least because the person prompting it doesn't have enough judgment to ascertain the appropriate quality. It is possible to use it for research. And I would say that\n\nUnknown: A PhD student could use it to get through their confirmation of candidature if their committee wasn't really paying attention. Like, not a good one, but like, you know, the indifferent to mediocre ones that we are told to have, it can produce better outputs than they can.\n\nUnknown: for confirmation of candidature. It lacks the spark of insight and induction that then gets them to a good piece of research for a PhD, but\n\nUnknown: Looking at it, and especially in light of some of the stuff that I've been peer reviewing yesterday, it's notably better than quite a lot of people out there. And so this is the first time in the last two weeks where I've thought that research is... We can say threatened, we can say changing. I'm going to not... imply an epistemological lens there. But this is a conversation to be had.\n\nUnknown: So I can talk about the journal infrastructure that I've built, noting that this is a non-Springer line. And so this would be\n\nUnknown: mostly a, well, we want to go diamond open access discussion because Springer has its own infrastructure and brand. And so if you're locked to Springer by virtue of infrastructure and brand, going to a different,\n\nUnknown: article preparation method doesn't make any sense, but I'm happy to show you what I've built over the last. And then I can talk to you about how I have been using these various tools for copy editing and for argumentation breakdowns, and also to massage some of my extremely grumpy peer reviews.\n\nUnknown: plus what it means to have AI as collaboration and what my minimum standards are, not for acknowledgement, because an acknowledgement implies credit for assisting, but in disclosure.\n\nUnknown: And we can go over there. So that's the rough agenda. I've been talking for five minutes. So please interrupt me. I'm sorry. I will just keep talking.\n\nUnknown: Not at all, Brian. I mean, that's fascinating. And I want to hear all that you have to say about all those topics. I think just about the Springer bit, it's a really interesting live conversation for us as a journal. I think probably the easiest summary is that, you know, we're expecting to be, you know, aligned with Springer for the foreseeable future, but certainly some thinking and planning for a potential future where the JBI sits somewhere elsewhere. Okay. is reasonable and timely. And these sorts of things obviously need quite a bit of lead time. Yes, of course. Yes, yes, yes. Okay.\n\nUnknown: So why don't we start there?\n\nUnknown: Um, mostly cause this doesn't involve any iota of AI. And so, um, so this is an example of a rebuild of a tiny little journal that I am, I'm helping with. Um, and so these are standard HTML. properly done, like this is not just a fly-by-night, like this is, okay, how do we present this as that? But more to the point, to render it as a full quality PDF that's a journal quality PDF. So that's the spec.\n\nUnknown: And I believe that we've hit that spec.\n\nUnknown: The way I achieved this is through something called, come on.\n\nUnknown: through a markup format called markdown. So markdown is a way of, sorry, it's been a while. I need to, there we are. So for example, here's this review article, right? And so this is what is built into both the HTML and the PDF.\n\nUnknown: And so this is what allows the Archipelago's journal to be diamond open access. So no fees to libraries, no fees to authors. It's just labor of love posted on GitHub.\n\nUnknown: And so when you decide that Springer has crossed ethical lines or is simply incompatible\n\nUnknown: The only thing to keep in mind, because the infrastructure that is appropriate to use changes roughly every five years, but it's quite durable. This is possible. And the major benefit of this is this is a much better archival format, because this is completely computer legible and durable in a way that\n\nUnknown: I mean, look, I trust Elsevier not to just disappear journals to a point, but also they're a company, so I don't actually trust them not to disappear journals.\n\nUnknown: And so I think that this is an entirely viable option, noting that expecting academics to write this is a joke, right? That the journal...\n\nUnknown: unfortunately has to accept Word documents and then transcribe.\n\nUnknown: There are ways, but effectively, this is the major pain for the journal. And it's the typesetting step that is necessary. And back when I was asked by you folks about whether or not we can use AI to help with typesetting, and my response was a violent no.\n\nUnknown: It is, we do not have sufficient assurance that if an AI is producing words, that those words are one-to-one equivalent with the inputs.\n\nUnknown: And so, no tool to my knowledge has achieved sufficient precision to be able to rewrite only the formatting instructions\n\nUnknown: of a document such that it can do that. Now, there are options. You can use Pandoc for some of this that can convert documents. But the problem is, I collaborate with so many folks, and I know what their standards of Word documents are.\n\nUnknown: It is implausible to expect any descriptive program to convert into a publication regulation. And so there will always be a human in the loop because typesetting is effectively art, right? It is effectively a choice of how do we display this text for best consumption by the readers. And because it's art, there's certainly no AI tool that I would trust to have the necessary care and attention to detail.\n\nUnknown: I starve.\n\nUnknown: If this was of significant interest to you as I'm talking to you about this, I do know how I would validate text-to-text comparison.\n\nUnknown: There are ways of using a computer to compare the pure text of the input and the output. And so it would be a software, it would be an engineering project to do this, but it would be an interesting one. And so put that in the, How much money do you have, Colin?\n\nUnknown: Because it's definitely not a, oh, here, I've solved this problem. It's a, this is research, but it wouldn't actually be an awful grant to do research on based on the developments of the last fortnight.\n\nUnknown: Right. So this is the typesetting infrastructure. For those of you who are interested, I'm mostly speaking in recording now, we're using LaTeX to generate this output. So it's consistent programmatic and open source.\n\nUnknown: And so there's some really decent ethical implications about not being tied to corporate programs. There are the standard virtues that I will not belabor here.\n\nUnknown: I will note that the price of those virtues is a lot of fiddly technical stuff, which is a real trade-off. And so making that decision is important.\n\nUnknown: OK.\n\nUnknown: So that is the typesetting side. And I do know that I was asked way back when of, can we use\n\nUnknown: AI to do typesetting preparation. And right now it's not solved, but it is now at the point where research into this is not automatically laughable. Okay. I'm not sure exactly how the typesetting works for us because I don't work on that side. But I think that another\n\nUnknown: a significant part of the copy editing aspect for our team, I think especially Bronwyn, is that sort of like manual going through every word or, you know, like spelling some grammar, complex errors, and that sort of level of copy editing beyond just the sort of formatting, although that's part of it. Yes, 100%. And so this is...\n\nUnknown: The script that I used a few days ago to do copy editing for my own paper. And this is actually a place where I think AI can be quite useful. Okay.\n\nUnknown: Mostly because it is not prescribing solutions if you prompt it correctly. It is serving as a tool to facilitate human judgment.\n\nUnknown: Because that's one of my drumbeats, right? Like, It is it is not your plastic pallet response be with it is not a mind outside of yours. It is just a tool.\n\nUnknown: And so, making sure that you have the appropriate prompting for this and like, let's be clear.\n\nUnknown: This is, this is just the the prompt formatting that I I like and there's there. This is a place of iteration.\n\nUnknown: So,\n\nUnknown: Here, what you can see is I tell it to do these three things.\n\nUnknown: So first off, highlight issues rather than making corrections. Again, this is the copy editor role rather than the... Great, you're both nodding. I don't have to explain it. It's so novel not to have to explain what copy editing is. And then here is what I have...\n\nUnknown: operationalized the task to be. Obviously, you can tweak this.\n\nUnknown: The more detail, the better.\n\nUnknown: Then, and I'm so sorry for any critical thinking academics in the audience.\n\nUnknown: This is an interesting thing that I'm playing around with is, okay, papers definitionally are making argumentative claims. They're trying to persuade some people of some things by some presentation of evidence. Therefore, hey, we have a standard model for doing that. Go do that for this paper. Let's see what claims this paper makes and if they are supported. And then finally, the tedious part of thinko and typo check paragraph by paragraph.\n\nUnknown: And then here is the pleading with it to adjust its vibe away from the, oh, you're so great vibe into something that's useful. And the amount of pleading necessary is kind of depressing, but it is what it is. So here's my setup. Then I literally paste in the paper.\n\nUnknown: just straight up paste in the paper with citations. And that's actually very important.\n\nUnknown: And just like the entire, entire thing.\n\nUnknown: And then I give it the sanity check as my final part of the prompt. Because anytime you're prompting, end your prompt with a specific task it needs to do, and it will do 80% to 100% of that task.\n\nUnknown: And then, OK, it gives me the readback, which just allows me to check that it was input correctly.\n\nUnknown: Great. And then it does functional decomposition or think step by step. And so this is a read back of,\n\nUnknown: So this does two things. One, this is a readback to itself so that what it's doing is amplified, but more to the point, this is a tacit information check. My prompt contained a great deal of tacit information around my word use and my expectations and my grammar. What this is doing is inflating that tacit information and making it explicit so that I can check that my statements to it were understood in the way that I wanted them to be.\n\nUnknown: But for you folks doing copy editing, this is literally what you would be doing.\n\nUnknown: Now, obviously, you'd want to probably arrange this differently, but that's fine. OK.\n\nUnknown: Then go and type a check because I think the main thing that's really useful with large language models over... I'm going to use this as an example. This is not a recommendation in the service. Service is like Grammarly.\n\nUnknown: And I know that this is not a recommendation in the service because they've all changed the terms of service to be really skeevy and it's annoyed me.\n\nUnknown: Because yes, I have to read all of the terms of service. It's creepy.\n\nUnknown: But this operates at a document level, not a paragraph level. And I think that that change is essential.\n\nUnknown: And then so this is bloody stupid, but you basically have to baby it along and say, take as much time as you need for this and just implore it to spend the time it should take. So this is about a 10 minute runtime.\n\nUnknown: And then there we go. Now it's super happy with this paper because my colleague did a great job with it.\n\nUnknown: And so like,\n\nUnknown: These sorts of things are the feedback that a copy editor would give or that a copy editor implementing edits would need because it is a different perspective of the text than just reading it through.\n\nUnknown: This is not like a good copy editor is doing this anyways, right? Like this is not...\n\nUnknown: reducing the skill that a professional can bring. But this can be a way of reducing the amount of faff that professional has to engage in before being able to use their skill.\n\nUnknown: And I think that that distinction is important. Because what I think this can offer even a good copy editor is, oh, hey, here's the trivial things that I can be on the lookout for.\n\nUnknown: noting that this may or may not be introducing bias into what they're looking out for, but also do we have time to read papers as deeply as we want to even when we are copy editing?\n\nUnknown: I cannot recommend this without reservations, but I do think that this level of interaction has reached a point where it is worth running experiments without too much trouble.\n\nUnknown: Um, there are some implications around consent and I can go through what I consider to be appropriate uses, um, noting that this interface is probably not the best one, especially for, um, Making sure that there's no data logging and there's no chance of data breaches, but we can go into that later, but still like this is as a high level thinking, I find this really good. More to the point, I think the main place where this is useful is not in final copy edit, but in before the editor decides to desk reject or send a peer reviewers, drop it in.\n\nUnknown: And I think that this is entirely appropriate to inform an editor's vibe before they decide to desk reject or not.\n\nUnknown: Right, and like, I think that these...\n\nUnknown: just because it highlights something doesn't mean that it's bad. It's just a, oh, here is something that you want to look at, which is the job of a copy editor, right?\n\nUnknown: And then, okay, now here's the model analysis of the paper's argument. I'm so sorry for the philosophers in the room because it makes the statements of these claims. But what's really useful for this is given this breakdown of the claims, does the paper reflect them?\n\nUnknown: And so I think that this is something that the copy editor simply doesn't have time to engage in.\n\nUnknown: And I think that this is a really interesting lens. And I can imagine a few other lenses that we could experiment with as well.\n\nUnknown: So it's grounds, warrant, backing.\n\nUnknown: Mark Alfano and I just wrote a paper on epileptic reasoning, so I put that in here.\n\nUnknown: And so I think that this is really quite useful because this gives the most standard rebuttal, right? It's not the most insightful rebuttal. There's no insight here, but it does give the most standard rebuttal, which means that if you look at the rebuttal and you go, eh, that's good, right?\n\nUnknown: But if you're persuaded by the rebuttal, then that's, okay, that's a sign I have to start paying attention.\n\nUnknown: And so there's a lot of heuristic elements here.\n\nUnknown: And so it goes through this, it engages with the citations of the paper to a degree that I find appropriate, where like the levels of confabulation here are low enough so that I,\n\nUnknown: I have not felt the need to engage the Metacritical thinking part of my mind when engaging with these texts.\n\nUnknown: Which is a weird claim, but like I with a one pro especially it's good enough.\n\nUnknown: Obviously, sorry, let me be very clear. It is good enough when manipulating a text.\n\nUnknown: Um, this is, this is in fact the best use case for AI where it is taking a text and responding to the tacit and explicit information within that text. It is less, I would not trust it with a one sentence. Tell me about bloody block. Um, even though I've used, I use it for one sentence, tell me about bloody blogs, but my epistemic stats, there is very different than my epistemic stance here.\n\nUnknown: And so here's the major claims. But what's useful is that it breaks out all of the major claims in the paper, which means the editor can see if they're signposted appropriately.\n\nUnknown: How easy is it to read this paper? Do these major claims feature in the abstract? Can we tell that they're there? Or are they buried in the middle of the paper? And I think that that's actually a very important editorial thing that editors may not have time to really engage in at length. Editors are likely reading it for vibes and then moving on.\n\nUnknown: So I think that that's useful. And then last and certainly not least is great. Here's the word level disfluencies that I found to be, yeah, no, that's that it absolutely pulled out the word level disfluencies.\n\nUnknown: Um,\n\nUnknown: But the thing is is that this is not grammarly, right? It's not pulling out usually grammatical problems. It's going cool. We should be using explicit teaching here in the abstract because it's in our paper, which is, again, a very different mode of interaction.\n\nUnknown: And so it just keeps going.\n\nUnknown: Do you have a question? This is a completely fascinating, very novel for me, certainly not something that I've, you know, utilized. And I really, really appreciate you guiding us through it. I had one question that's just completely naive.\n\nUnknown: But I was just really interested about the, you know, continuing to remind the large language model to think slowly and carefully oh my god it's no no you're not naive why is that a thing that's so that's really interesting oh my god well so a you're not naive because literally these invocations to the spirits are new based on uh reasoning models because basically reasoning models will decide that they're done\n\nUnknown: at some point, and the more you plead with the spirits to take as much time as you want, then think thoroughly, like literally I was complaining to my friends today that I was babying this, right? That like, here's some of the research I'm doing, right? But like literally this kind of infantilizing, I know you can do it language,\n\nUnknown: Seriously, this is new as of two and a half weeks ago, so I don't know how to do the, no, really, do this well. I'll go do other things while you're waiting. I'm not impatient, is the correct invocation to the spirits.\n\nUnknown: I hate this level of infantilization of AI. I think that this is such a poor design decision where instead we could just have a slider of AI take more time, take less time. But this is what OpenAI has decided in their wisdom to do.\n\nUnknown: It is weird. And just to show you what it looks like when a less good paper goes in, because I had to review a flat reject yesterday.\n\nUnknown: So I got a journal, a request for peer review in. I'm like, cool, I'm going to use that. And the paper started about quantum woo shit. It's an awful paper. It's like, okay, I want to see what O1 Pro makes of a bad paper instead of one of my papers.\n\nUnknown: Like, literally, this is the first sentence of the abstract. It's\n\nUnknown: Like, it's just odd. But it's the exact same pattern that I showed you.\n\nUnknown: And then what you can see is that I have a grimoire, literally spellbook, of prompts that I can reuse for specific situations.\n\nUnknown: And then invocation to the spirits.\n\nUnknown: It's, it is, we live in, like, this is why I actually think that we might be living in revolutionary science in the Kuhnian sense, because just our prior modes of understanding the world don't have as much explanatory power as I'd really like them to have.\n\nUnknown: I don't like it, but I'm definitely playing with it, and I'm one of the first people playing with it. Anyways.\n\nUnknown: But, like, you can see how its tone swaps to tone, which means that this is very useful to us as people reviewing.\n\nUnknown: Also, on that line...\n\nUnknown: Hey, well, you folks, oh, great. We're recording my RSS reader. Good job. Oh, well.\n\nUnknown: Searching.\n\nUnknown: So you folks are aware of the horrible black plastic kitchen appliance paper that caused an uproar and then was retracted because it was so bad, or not retracted, but like the stats in it were very bad.\n\nUnknown: Or should I explain that?\n\nUnknown: You can explain it to me, Brian. I'm not quite sure what you're saying.\n\nUnknown: There we are.\n\nUnknown: So basically, there was a major thing that hit. a lot of the blogs that black plastic kitchen utensils contain so much car dye that it was bad because of microplastics and whatever for your health and you should throw out all of your kitchenware, except the stats were awful in it.\n\nUnknown: And so this is the black plastic study that apparently caused the journal to be de-indexed.\n\nUnknown: I mean, let's be clear. It was a sketchy germ, but, um, so, but the thing is, is that now I have to find, sorry, I'm sophisticated than using Google news.\n\nUnknown: Yeah, that's my RSS reader that I have curated properly. OK.\n\nUnknown: So this is Cohen talking about that. But the thing is, I'm sorry. I should not be searching in the middle of a conversation about this. But basically, Cohen said that he put the paper in\n\nUnknown: to 01 to see what statistical errors were in the paper.\n\nUnknown: And OK, so this is, don't worry about it. Anyways, I'll find it when we're not on the call. Effectively, 01 was able to spot the statistical errors.\n\nUnknown: So I find that for a journal,\n\nUnknown: Having a journal-specific prompt for copy editing and for editorial assistance can augment the editor's judgment.\n\nUnknown: And so one of the themes that I harp on is these tools are very, very, very bad at automation. which is weird because normally computers are quite good at automation.\n\nUnknown: These things are awful at automation because they do not exhibit judgment.\n\nUnknown: But they can augment and increase the quality of our outputs because they... I mean, you know, we can buy Vandana Haraway stuff. They're the exocortex. They make us cyborgs, etc., etc., etc., right? But...\n\nUnknown: They are a way for us to export some processing of what we're doing in a way that I find quite useful. And so for a journal to increase the quality of what it's doing, this is appropriate.\n\nUnknown: Note, this is not actually a claim for efficiency. Because doing this is not likely more efficient than skimming the thing and just doing a vibe-based rejector.\n\nUnknown: I do think that this can improve the quality without undue extra time. Sorry, you've unmuted. What's your question?\n\nUnknown: I feel like this is, again, a pretty silly question, Brian. There are. I admit. I admit.\n\nUnknown: also pretty good at determining the novelty of an argument or novelty of an argument?\n\nUnknown: No, actually.\n\nUnknown: Let me be very clear. That's a great question. Remember how I said judgment?\n\nUnknown: Novelty of a statement is a function of both the literature and the judgment.\n\nUnknown: And I actually think that\n\nUnknown: They will react to the language of the paper and engage with the superlatives in the paper rather than the tacit information of the discipline for judgments and novelty. So I actually think that that one specific area, the fundamental job of the editor, cannot be well exported to AI.\n\nUnknown: Everything else, fine. But it's that pinch point that is that moment of decision that cannot and should not be exported at current mobile quality.\n\nUnknown: And I have been playing with it in terms of deep research. And let me be clear.\n\nUnknown: If there are questions of novelty, then, sorry, let me just find one of the ones, right? If there are questions of novelty, then you can certainly go a, well, here's a paper, go find articles that speak on the same thing.\n\nUnknown: And it does a fairly decent job of that. So it can support the, there's a gigantic asterisk here, by the way,\n\nUnknown: claims for novelty in searching. The problem with this is it searches the open access and easily indexed literature. It doesn't search in paywall literature.\n\nUnknown: So I actually think that it must not and presently cannot be used to assess novelty.\n\nUnknown: No, that was actually a genuine question. That's what I'm writing the recurring paper on.\n\nUnknown: Thank you. It makes me feel less completely off the boil. Also, to be clear, all of this has existed for about two and a half weeks.\n\nUnknown: So, like, I'm not sure claims of naivete can be levied in not paying attention\n\nUnknown: to the implications of the software release for two and a half weeks.\n\nUnknown: So thanks, Brian. You're very kind.\n\nUnknown: I guess...\n\nUnknown: I mean, personally, I've got so much out of hearing you talk about and my sense of the potential utility for this, conscious that I hear what you're saying is that the primary function is a quality function rather than necessarily an efficiency function, which I think is really, really useful for us. I mean, ultimately, we are a journal where improving our efficiency is a key goal, but improving our quality is probably our primary focus. And so I think that, you know, there's certainly merit in us exploring that. I would think, not wanting to speak for the entire team or all of our colleagues.\n\nUnknown: What would you think if we were going to, conscious again of our likely embedded relationship with Springer for the foreseeable future, what would you think would be your recommendation to a journal like us of the next step for a small team of people who aren't anywhere near as tech literate as you are?\n\nUnknown: So the best, okay, so this is where I get to show my favorite quote.\n\nUnknown: This requires no technical knowledge.\n\nUnknown: This is the quote that I show everyone. Sarah, you've seen this before. I show it at my workshops. The thing is, LLMs are deeply, inherently textual, and they're reliant on text in a way that is directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in university humanities classes.\n\nUnknown: For you to use this as a journal, the only thing you need to do is have a grimoire.\n\nUnknown: I keep using that term.\n\nUnknown: Literally, spell work. That prompts are portable. That if you can encode your tacit expertise into a prompt, you can reuse it.\n\nUnknown: Noting that that statement is doing a lot of heavy lifting.\n\nUnknown: you can make a grimoire and all you have to do is pay for access to uh probably chat ship it although i i i i also use quad i like i literally use both of these it's hilarious um and and there there's some um\n\nUnknown: implications here.\n\nUnknown: But what I think is getting whomever handles incoming papers access to this, plus this, the trick is consent, right? That\n\nUnknown: Effectively, this is, hey, we are trialing using this to improve the quality and the timeliness of our editorial feedback. Would you like us to use this? Fully transparent, right? Like, the only way to do this is to be fully... Ah, that's the other... Don't remind me not to forget to show you what I consider to be appropriate acknowledgements. The thing is, is that... If you have the ability in your Springer submission portal to have a toggle where they can say, hey, yes, we want to experiment with this, noting that this is human in the loop all the way, et cetera, and crafting that's going to be kind of fiddly, that's where I would experiment.\n\nUnknown: Because then it's informed consent. It's people can say, well, I don't feel comfortable submitting this to AI regardless of whatever. At which point, that's fine. It goes in the old queue.\n\nUnknown: Or the people who do want to experiment, great, they get their responses more quickly.\n\nUnknown: That is the first recommendation that I would make. What I would say is anyone who says that they have used AI in their paper to produce it has forfeited their deontological right to have AI not work on their paper on your\n\nUnknown: Like you don't get it both ways. And I would say that that is probably the easiest way to start.\n\nUnknown: On that note, I do not consider acknowledgements to be appropriate because at the end of the day, what we do, think is appropriate AI use changes every six to eight bloody weeks.\n\nUnknown: What we consider to be inappropriate prompting strategy changes, what we consider to be appropriate models change and so on and so forth. By the way, if you're interested, a colleague and I just put up this blueprint. It's still getting approved, but you might be interested in that. The reason I'm showing this to you is at the end, What I had us put in is a disclaimer of what did we actually do with it? And then most to the point, link open science framework where my system prompt and every single transcript of every single AI use has been dropped into this repository.\n\nUnknown: Because what that means is someone going, all right, I want to see what judgment you exhibit can go here and read my prompts, even the embarrassing ones.\n\nUnknown: No, seriously. And that's why I clicked on this one, because it's like, this is, remember how I was making fun of people giving single line prompts?\n\nUnknown: But this is the thing, is this is now part of the durable record of the paper, so that if someone wants to critique me on this paper, they can. Not simply AI use, but what did I do, when, and how? So I think that having a model format of\n\nUnknown: complete and transparent disclosure down to transcripts. Because let's be clear, the main thing that transcripts are useful for are the user prompts, not the AI responses. I do not care about the AI responses when I'm evaluating. I care what the user says so that I can evaluate their effective judgment.\n\nUnknown: But because we are entering maybe a period of revolutionary science, sorry, couldn't\n\nUnknown: The only way we can do this is be transparent and say, here's everything I have done and full logs and full star reproducibility of my use of these models, including the specification of which model, because it matters.\n\nUnknown: So I think that this is a norm that is an important norm regardless of what other AI use is engaged.\n\nUnknown: Hello, new person. Welcome.\n\nUnknown: You're muted. Paul, you're muted still.\n\nUnknown: Sorry, I'm not doing so well, am I? I'm sorry I'm so late. No worries. As to the presentation. And I so much wanted to hear it. So I'm really- Happily, we have recorded this. And I suspect that it will make a very interesting transcript.\n\nUnknown: It's been completely fascinating, Paul. So I'm sure you'll really enjoy watching it.\n\nUnknown: Brian, I had one other question, if that's okay. 100%, yeah. So I really appreciate the reference to brimoise and really see the value of their development.\n\nUnknown: Again, conscious of our, you know, very relative ignorance, if we were trying to develop something like that for use in our journal, would that be the sort of thing we could ask for your support in doing? Yeah, of course. Or is there some way of us doing that? Like, literally, I'll just paste my... prompts to me. Actually, I don't even have to paste my prompts to you because if I've done my job correctly, you have them because I have published them. Yes, sure.\n\nUnknown: So obviously, from a trivial perspective, yes, absolutely, you can just use this. From a pragmatic perspective, we can talk about me supporting you folks in developing a notional grimoire for this purpose. And I think that that is an appropriate research conversation to be had.\n\nUnknown: Sure.\n\nUnknown: Sure.\n\nUnknown: Thanks, Brian. I've got a tremendous amount out of this, and I really appreciate it. It's been very eye-opening. I feel like I've learnt so much. Can you tell that I lecture on this every year? It's a little evident, a little evident. So unfortunately I've got other things that I have to get on to my next meeting in a sec, but I'm conscious, Paul, you've just arrived, and Sarah, I've done a lot of the talking. I'm not sure if either of you guys had things that you wanted to add.\n\nUnknown: Look, the questions that I would ask you may well have answered, of course, so it's a little bit presumptuous for me to ask questions that you've probably spent an hour discussing.\n\nUnknown: But have you touched on adequately the questions of the extent to which we can utilise AI for copy editing of our manuscripts and\n\nUnknown: Also, whether there are AI detection algorithms. We have been very carefully not talked about that final bit.\n\nUnknown: So let me just... Because an argument by authority is always more fun.\n\nUnknown: Can we detect AI? No.\n\nUnknown: More clearly, we can see bad and lazy use of AI, but we cannot... There are no statistical indicators of the effective and thoughtful use of AI that are anything beyond please self-incriminate.\n\nUnknown: nor do I think that this is an apt thing to be trying to prove. That effectively, what we care about is the quality of the final output, and the person who puts their name to that output is at fault for the quality, regardless of if that is good or bad. And so the consequence of the\n\nUnknown: tooling provided by AI is that our standards have to go up.\n\nUnknown: And I started this, I think, and I started this before we started recording, saying that I think that journals are no longer going to be the currency of knowledge that they have become in the post-war world.\n\nUnknown: because the rate of paper generation, both good and bad, and you folks know how many bad papers there are for as many good papers as get through, will go up to a level that is unsustainable. And so I think that there need to be conversations around the appropriateness of, well, how do we disseminate knowledge? How do we engage in this game of academic currency, but also knowledge building?\n\nUnknown: that journals are the gatekeepers and mediators and judges for. So I think that there is a place to be had. But what I would say is because good output from a large language model is effectively impossible to detect, noting that if your only experience with this is Chat chip at 3.5, your expectations are badly miscalibrated.\n\nUnknown: Sorry, let me go find a decent example of this.\n\nUnknown: Can you tell that I've been poking at this a little bit?\n\nUnknown: Just a smidge?\n\nUnknown: There we are.\n\nUnknown: That what we care about is insight and specificity, not\n\nUnknown: AI detection, right? Because the thing is, is that with deep research, a descriptive boring literature review can be had at the cost of $200.\n\nUnknown: Noting that this is at the quality of a first week PhD candidate, it lacks the central insight, it lacks the persuasiveness, but we have all seen papers like this. And if they had come from an undergrad or a master's, they would have been graded quite highly.\n\nUnknown: it's not amazing writing but it's entirely serviceable\n\nUnknown: And like, I'm trying to be very careful in that line saying, well, this is not a pure dichotomy. But what that means is that because we are going to be getting this, we have to set our standards such that this is no longer an acceptable contribution to the... My brain just died.\n\nUnknown: to the knowledge.\n\nUnknown: Whatever. You know what I'm saying. Sorry. It's been a year.\n\nUnknown: So basically, this is where we need to actually have conversations discipline by discipline around, okay, so these tools have absolutely proved Donna Haraway right. They are absolutely exocortexes. They have made us all cyborgs.\n\nUnknown: What does that mean for our expectations and our standards? Noting that if we increase our expectations and our standards, those who choose to exist within the prior paradigm will be left out.\n\nUnknown: And so there are questions of equity, there are questions of appropriateness, and there's questions of norms that I can raise. I cannot tell you what the answers are.\n\nUnknown: But the problem is, at the same time, we simply cannot command the sea to stop.\n\nUnknown: And I mean this in the most pragmatic sense, that because there are no durable ways of detecting good output, the detection penalizes those who are neurodiverse. English is a second language.\n\nUnknown: They perpetuate prejudice more than...\n\nUnknown: perform a serviceable thing. And so there's actually some real epistemic dangers from using AI detectors beyond the point of we can read something and tell if it's bad or not. That's the only detection that matters is, is this interesting? Is this well-written?\n\nUnknown: But our standards are changing, our expectations are changing, and our norms need to be renegotiated in a way that's really\n\nUnknown: off-putting to people who expected to just be able to contribute to their little corner of knowledge in a way that they have been used to.\n\nUnknown: Sorry, Paul, I've literally been talking like this for the last hour. I know that Michael has to go. Oh, yes, so sorry.\n\nUnknown: I have a couple of questions. If you're available...\n\nUnknown: That's right.\n\nUnknown: Your network connection has gone quite poor. Let's turn off our videos.\n\nUnknown: Oh, that's even worse.\n\nUnknown: Michael, if you need to take off, shoot me an email with your questions, and we'll continue this correspondence over text.\n\nUnknown: Paul, are you still there?\n\nUnknown: Yes, I'm still here. And Michael is still on. Yeah, Michael.\n\nUnknown: I can't see if Sarah's still there. Yes, Sarah is still here. Okay.\n\nUnknown: So the connection was all right for me, but I'm happy just to continue like this.\n\nUnknown: I had a question about bias. You know, we talk a lot about algorithmic bias.\n\nUnknown: and the ways in which that operates in specific AI applications have been well documented. Yes. Do the large language models have, can we talk about them being biased in one direction or another? Certainly when I interrogate chat GPT,\n\nUnknown: I'm aware of a certain cultural style underlying it that I suppose may simply characterise the entire internet data set, but it may also be something that has been introduced at the level of the more fundamental concepts.\n\nUnknown: And the style would favour a kind of liberal democratic culture, which I'm sure is not general in the internet. Would you comment on the question of whether the large language models incorporate an inherent bias?\n\nUnknown: Wow, it feels like I'm standing for a PhD dissertation.\n\nUnknown: Okay, so here's a recent example of straight up racism, right?\n\nUnknown: Marion's Australian.\n\nUnknown: The fact that 01 said, a woman of color from the global South, come on, right? So there's absolutely places of racism and that sort of thing that are still present\n\nUnknown: Okay, so that's the easy answer. That's also not a useful answer.\n\nUnknown: Sorry, let me get my thoughts in order. It's been a day.\n\nUnknown: And so while you're doing that, I could just comment. Obviously, I'm opposed to racism as you are too.\n\nUnknown: On the other hand, not everyone who uses the internet is opposed to racism. Yes. And if a racist were to approach one of the large language models, would they inherently be resistant because the large language models have certain beliefs or assumptions built into them about racism? So, okay. There is a no with a giant asterisk. And so this is the answer that I was trying to think through.\n\nUnknown: A lot of the bias and so as a note, a lot of this comes from the experiments that I did by teaching a semester long class literally in the pragmatics of AI looking at bias last semester, so this is this is the classroom experiments.\n\nUnknown: Much of the bias of large language models comes from the tacit expectations of the prompts.\n\nUnknown: which is to say how you prompt it and what you ask it for is overwhelmingly informationally dense relative to its training data set. And so therefore, whatever bias is implied in your language is going to be reflected in its output because it is a tool that does not have beliefs. We cannot ascribe belief to it. It is a tool that if we want to be...\n\nUnknown: derogatory. We can start talking about spicy autocompleters, stochastic parrots, or what have you. But in my experience, outside of the distracting racism, it is mostly a function of input text causing bias that reflects the input text more than bias in the model itself. However,\n\nUnknown: The place where it does exhibit bias, and this is, so Mark Alfano and I just released this to me. We had a brief aside here.\n\nUnknown: And Olya Kadina, sorry, Olya Kadina, Mark and I released this. She's in the Netherlands and Mark's present.\n\nUnknown: Bias is an availability bias. So in the absence of good prompting, if you ask large language models for facts, A, you've already failed because they're not fact engines.\n\nUnknown: Treating them as fact engines is deeply problematic. There are no databases of facts. Let's not even get into justified true belief debates or not, right? The whole get here problem. But\n\nUnknown: The bias is towards the normal white male Western canon because of the relative proportion of the data set that they occupy. With prompting, you absolutely can get it to respond however you want to. The defaults baked in will be effectively a cultural average default more so than any\n\nUnknown: specific liberal bias or not. Noting that the system prompts that you encounter in commercial products, so OpenAI's ChatGPT uses various models, GPT-4 Omni, O1 Pro, O3 Mini High, et cetera. Cloud.ai has its own set.\n\nUnknown: The corporate interfaces to these models,\n\nUnknown: impose a level of decorum that perpetuates a middle-of-the-road boring bias that is actually noteworthy in its epistemic poison.\n\nUnknown: Because inherently it is an argument against novelty because it will always argue the thought. And so this is literally thoughts that I'm working into papers.\n\nUnknown: This is the Aristotelian failure mode.\n\nUnknown: right, that scholars in the Aristotelian paradigm took authorities as the highest source of truth over experimental evidence. And it is exactly this failure mode that large language models fall into.\n\nUnknown: And I'm gonna be putting that into a paper soon.\n\nUnknown: And so so this is this is actually quite insidious because to most people, this sort of Carnapian confirmation is good. Right. We accumulate evidence. We trust the authorities, whereas to the actual practice of research.\n\nUnknown: which we call science or what have you, it's deeply problematic. And so there is absolutely a bias there, but that bias exists only in the tacit information of your prompts that you can definitely cause it to overcome by effective prompting. Noting that I'm excluding Musk's nonsense from all of this because I'd prefer not to think about it.\n\nUnknown: Sorry. Yes. You said that Yeah, that's interesting. So it kind of second guesses. That's what prelipsis is, I suppose. It kind of reads assumptions into the question. 100%, yes. It takes the tacit information in your prompt and expands it.\n\nUnknown: Okay, how interesting. I have another question, but I know you've been talking for an hour and it's very presumptuous of me to come in late and ask questions. Let me just change my schedule.\n\nUnknown: Okay, I have about 10 minutes before I have to prepare for my next meeting, because I have a 6pm. And Sarah, I don't want to interrupt anything that you wanted to ask or say.\n\nUnknown: No, I'm happy to. I'm going to stay on for the recording but also I can stay until 5.30.\n\nUnknown: I don't think I have any specific questions at the moment and I've also had plenty of opportunity, Paul, so don't worry. So I'm happy for you to continue. Okay. Thank you. And so maybe I'll just ask one more question and then, Sarah, you'll make the recording available. Yes, I will. And as an experiment, we'll also try to drop the recording through AI to see what it makes of it, because that will be an interesting proof of the pudding is in the eating moment.\n\nUnknown: And I'm taking for granted that you had the discussion about the use of AI for copy editing. Is that right? Yes. Okay, so I don't have to go. So my other then last question is...\n\nUnknown: about the extent to which AI can actually be original or creative or innovative.\n\nUnknown: And I mean that in kind of all possible senses. Obviously, creativity can be simply drawing things together in a mechanical way. But I'm thinking of the idea\n\nUnknown: kind of leaps of judgment and logic, such as the sort of things that Kant talked about, transcendental apperception or the syntheses that occur that are not, that can't simply be generated through the application of kind of formulae or possibly algorithms. if you want to put it in those terms. Does AI have the capacity actually to make those leaps of logic or insight that characterize human creativity?\n\nUnknown: Briefly, no.\n\nUnknown: Um, a lot. So this is, um, in my workshops, I talk about how people mistake the kitten in the mirror as a separate, how kittens will hiss and kitten in the mirror. Cause they don't have a sense of themselves, right? When people ascribe creativity to AI, this is the exact same failure mode that the creativity in this is a function of the set of initial prompting plus the function of the set of users judgment.\n\nUnknown: These things are tools. They are not minds. They have no beliefs.\n\nUnknown: They do not exhibit judgment in any useful way. They can perform the language of judgment, which confuses a lot of folks, but they do not exhibit judgment, not in any meaningful way. Noting that my prediction horizon for these statements is about two weeks in the future, because this test of O3 mini high has done the best of any of the things that I've tested on my induction test. This is my standard benchmark for induction, and this has easily beaten my benchmark, which is kind of annoying, because I now have to figure out a new one.\n\nUnknown: But to answer your question,\n\nUnknown: These things are tools. They are no more and no less than tools. It is up to us as humans to supply the techniques and the goals to leverage these tools into useful outputs, to borrow from Heidi and Heidegger.\n\nUnknown: All right.\n\nUnknown: Thank you. Noting that this is my belief, and there are people who certainly have opposing beliefs, but I think that the component, and this is actually one of the places where I most strongly disagree with Moloch.\n\nUnknown: Moloch asserts creativity. I think this is wrong.\n\nUnknown: But I see the point that he's making. However, he is disvaluing, that's another word, whatever, the tacit information in the initial prompt plus the exercise of judgment needed to take the text and do something with it. But this is the claim that he is making.\n\nUnknown: I think he is wrong. This is a place of current debate, and he certainly is a better known person in this sphere than I am. So you are certainly welcome to decide between which of these authorities you think is right.\n\nUnknown: From my tests, these things are not capable of creativity because they're not capable of editing. They are not capable of working on their own.\n\nUnknown: They're not capable of forgetting, nor are they capable of acting on a theory of a theory of mind such that they are able to persuade and engage in the models of others, which I think is a necessary component of creativity in terms of modeling minds outside of ourselves.\n\nUnknown: There's a lot in what I just said.\n\nUnknown: And I would say that we are verging into beer territory. But I would have to go into some detail to show you what I mean in all the various experiments that I've run.\n\nUnknown: That's very helpful. Thank you.\n\nUnknown: Do note that just because they're not creative in the fundamental sense, they have significant mundane utility.\n\nUnknown: That I think that they are creativity enhancing tools to an extent hitherto unknown, but they are not intrinsically of themselves creative.\n\nUnknown: And there's a really narrow nuance there.\n\nUnknown: Paul, do you have any more questions? No, I'm happy to leave it there. Thanks, Sarah. Yeah, we might let you go, Brian. Thank you so much for this. It was really, really fascinating, really, really interesting and really, really helpful.\n\nUnknown: Not just to me, but I'm sure it will be to the rest of the team and will prompt much more thinking and probably further questions.\n\nUnknown: Of course.\n\nUnknown: And I'm happy to have the occasional email or beer with you folks.\n\nUnknown: Thanks very much, Brian. Thank you. It's my pleasure. Thanks, Brian. I'm sorry again for being so late. I really look forward to looking at the recording. It's my pleasure. And sorry for just defaulting into my standard lecture. Oh, no. It was a lecture that I think we all needed. Okay.\n\nUnknown: Speaking earlier before, Paul, I'm not sure that you had joined yet, but you were sort of talking about events or developments that have only happened in the last few weeks. Yes.\n\nUnknown: Even just to have your brain to contextualise those events is really, really fascinating. So thank you very much. Thank you. It's my pleasure. Thank you, Sarah. Would you just have a couple of minutes before we finish? Sure, sure. I'll just say I'll process the recording and I'll send it back. Sure. Josh Triplett- All right, I will make you host so that all hop off.\n\nUnknown: Josh Triplett- And probably hit the record button. Josh Triplett- it's showing is still recording.\n\nUnknown: Oh yes session.\n</transcript>\n\nPlease give me a rough breakdown of what sections you've detected in this conversation, and perform a detailed functional decomposition on the tasks I gave you so that I know we're understanding them in the same way.

            "content": "# Academic AI Tools: Questions and Answers\n\n## Infrastructure & Implementation\n\n### Q: How can AI tools be used in journal preparation?\nThe discussion emphasizes AI as an augmentation tool rather than an automation solution. As stated in the transcript:\n\n> \"These tools are very, very, very bad at automation... These things are awful at automation because they do not exhibit judgment. But they can augment and increase the quality of our outputs.\"\n\nThe key applications include:\n- Pre-review quality assessment\n- Copy editing assistance\n- Argument structure analysis\n- Initial quality screening\n\nThe speaker notes that while this may not increase efficiency, it can improve quality:\n> \"Note, this is not actually a claim for efficiency. Because doing this is not likely more efficient than skimming the thing and just doing a vibe-based rejector. I do think that this can improve the quality without undue extra time.\"\n\n### Q: What are the implications for journals tied to major publishers?\nThe discussion acknowledges the reality of publisher relationships while suggesting preparation for alternatives:\n\n> \"We're expecting to be aligned with Springer for the foreseeable future, but certainly some thinking and planning for a potential future where the JBI sits somewhere elsewhere is reasonable and timely.\"\n\nThe speaker presents alternative infrastructure options:\n> \"This is what allows the Archipelago's journal to be diamond open access. So no fees to libraries, no fees to authors. It's just labor of love posted on GitHub.\"\n\n### Q: What would be the next steps for a small team with limited technical literacy?\nThe response emphasizes that technical expertise isn't necessary:\n\n> \"This requires no technical knowledge... LLMs are deeply, inherently textual, and they're reliant on text in a way that is directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in university humanities classes.\"\n\nThe key recommendation is developing a \"grimoire\" (collection of prompts):\n> \"For you to use this as a journal, the only thing you need to do is have a grimoire... Literally, spell work. That prompts are portable. That if you can encode your tacit expertise into a prompt, you can reuse it.\"\n\n### Q: How can journals implement AI tools while maintaining quality?\nThe emphasis is on consent and transparency:\n\n> \"Effectively, this is, hey, we are trialing using this to improve the quality and the timeliness of our editorial feedback. Would you like us to use this? Fully transparent...\"\n\nThe speaker suggests a toggle in submission systems:\n> \"If you have the ability in your Springer submission portal to have a toggle where they can say, hey, yes, we want to experiment with this, noting that this is human in the loop all the way...\"\n\n## Copy Editing & Quality\n\n### Q: Can AI be used for typesetting and formatting?\nThe answer is currently negative, with specific concerns about accuracy:\n\n> \"We do not have sufficient assurance that if an AI is producing words, that those words are one-to-one equivalent with the inputs... no tool to my knowledge has achieved sufficient precision to be able to rewrite only the formatting instructions.\"\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that typesetting requires human judgment:\n> \"Typesetting is effectively art... It is effectively a choice of how do we display this text for best consumption by the readers. And because it's art, there's certainly no AI tool that I would trust to have the necessary care and attention to detail.\"\n\n### Q: How effective is AI for copy editing tasks?\nThe speaker demonstrates a structured approach to copy editing with AI:\n> \"This is actually a place where I think AI can be quite useful... Mostly because it is not prescribing solutions if you prompt it correctly. It is serving as a tool to facilitate human judgment.\"\n\nThe emphasis is on using AI to identify issues rather than make corrections:\n> \"Highlight issues rather than making corrections... This is the copy editor role rather than the...\"\n\n### Q: Why is it necessary to continually remind AI to \"think slowly\"?\nThis relates to model behavior:\n\n> \"Reasoning models will decide that they're done at some point, and the more you plead with the spirits to take as much time as you want, then think thoroughly... This is new as of two and a half weeks ago.\"\n\nThe speaker notes this as a design choice:\n> \"I hate this level of infantilization of AI. I think that this is such a poor design decision where instead we could just have a slider of AI take more time, take less time. But this is what OpenAI has decided in their wisdom to do.\"\n\n### Q: Can AI determine the novelty of arguments?\nThe answer is definitively no:\n\n> \"Novelty of a statement is a function of both the literature and the judgment... They will react to the language of the paper and engage with the superlatives in the paper rather than the tacit information of the discipline for judgments and novelty.\"\n\nThe speaker identifies this as a fundamental limitation:\n> \"I actually think that that one specific area, the fundamental job of the editor, cannot and should not be exported at current model quality.\"\n\n[Continued in next section...]",

            "new_str": "## Ethical & Epistemological Questions\n\n### Q: What is the new currency of knowledge contribution in an AI era?\nThe speaker suggests a fundamental shift in academic publishing:\n\n> \"I think that journals are no longer going to be the currency of knowledge that they have become in the post-war world... because the rate of paper generation, both good and bad, and you folks know how many bad papers there are for as many good papers as get through, will go up to a level that is unsustainable.\"\n\nThis leads to a need for new standards:\n> \"With deep research, a descriptive boring literature review can be had at the cost of $200... we have to set our standards such that this is no longer an acceptable contribution to the knowledge.\"\n\n### Q: How should AI use be acknowledged or disclosed?\nThe speaker advocates for complete transparency:\n\n> \"I do not consider acknowledgements to be appropriate because at the end of the day, what we do, think is appropriate AI use changes every six to eight bloody weeks.\"\n\nInstead, they recommend comprehensive documentation:\n> \"Complete and transparent disclosure down to transcripts... I care what the user says so that I can evaluate their effective judgment.\"\n\nThe recommendation includes:\n> \"Link open science framework where my system prompt and every single transcript of every single AI use has been dropped into this repository... Because what that means is someone going, all right, I want to see what judgment you exhibit can go here and read my prompts, even the embarrassing ones.\"\n\n### Q: What are the implications for bias in AI systems?\nThe response identifies multiple layers of bias:\n\n> \"Much of the bias of large language models comes from the tacit expectations of the prompts... whatever bias is implied in your language is going to be reflected in its output because it is a tool that does not have beliefs.\"\n\nThe speaker identifies availability bias as a key issue:\n> \"The bias is towards the normal white male Western canon because of the relative proportion of the data set that they occupy. With prompting, you absolutely can get it to respond however you want to.\"\n\nThere's also a structural bias in commercial interfaces:\n> \"The corporate interfaces to these models impose a level of decorum that perpetuates a middle-of-the-road boring bias that is actually noteworthy in its epistemic poison.\"\n\n### Q: Can AI be truly creative or innovative?\nThe answer is definitively negative:\n\n> \"These things are tools. They are not minds. They have no beliefs... They do not exhibit judgment in any useful way. They can perform the language of judgment, which confuses a lot of folks, but they do not exhibit judgment, not in any meaningful way.\"\n\nThe speaker elaborates on why:\n> \"They're not capable of creativity because they're not capable of editing. They are not capable of working on their own... They're not capable of forgetting, nor are they capable of acting on a theory of a theory of mind such that they are able to persuade and engage in the models of others.\"\n\nHowever, they note the tool's utility:\n> \"Just because they're not creative in the fundamental sense, they have significant mundane utility... they are creativity enhancing tools to an extent hitherto unknown, but they are not intrinsically of themselves creative.\"\n\n## Technical Process Questions\n\n### Q: How should prompts be structured for academic work?\nThe speaker demonstrates a structured approach:\n\n> \"Here's my setup... anytime you're prompting, end your prompt with a specific task it needs to do, and it will do 80% to 100% of that task.\"\n\nKey elements include:\n- Clear task definition\n- Explicit expectations\n- Specific output requirements\n- Quality checks\n\n### Q: What are the limitations of AI in academic contexts?\nSeveral key limitations are identified:\n\n1. Judgment and novelty assessment\n2. Creative insight\n3. Deep understanding of disciplinary context\n4. Ability to verify factual claims\n\nThe speaker emphasizes:\n> \"These things are awful at automation because they do not exhibit judgment. But they can augment and increase the quality of our outputs.\"\n\n### Q: How can we detect AI-generated content?\nThe speaker is definitive:\n\n> \"Can we detect AI? No... More clearly, we can see bad and lazy use of AI, but we cannot... There are no statistical indicators of the effective and thoughtful use of AI that are anything beyond please self-incriminate.\"\n\nThey argue this isn't the right approach:\n> \"What we care about is the quality of the final output, and the person who puts their name to that output is at fault for the quality, regardless of if that is good or bad.\"\n\n### Q: What documentation standards should be applied to AI use?\nThe speaker advocates for comprehensive documentation:\n\n1. Full prompt disclosure\n2. Model specifications\n3. Complete interaction logs\n4. Open access to methodology\n\nAs stated:\n> \"The only way we can do this is be transparent and say, here's everything I have done and full logs and full star reproducibility of my use of these models, including the specification of which model, because it matters.\"",
