A list of potential sources organized by topic areas that we need for the \"Nature of Research Work\" section\n2. The outline of section 2.3 with claims, warrants, and needed literature for each paragraph\n3. Three block quotes from academic sources about rhetoric of science and literature review methods\n\nYou're asking me to:\n1. Assess if these quotes properly address the \"rhetoric of science and lit review methods\" needs\n2. Help you integrate these sources within your paper section\n3. Maintain the critical, academic approach you outlined in your previous instructions (pushing back rather than giving empty praise)\n\nLet me analyze the quotes and their relevance to the section outline:\n\nFirst quote (Kelly et al., 2003, p. 30):\n- Discusses the specialized argumentative practices of different disciplines\n- Emphasizes how students must develop competencies in field-specific argumentative patterns\n- Explains how students must learn the types of claims, evidence, and stance appropriate to their fields\n- Relevance: This strongly supports paragraph 1 & 2 about the persuasive nature of academic writing and discipline-specific conventions\n\nSecond quote (Rochma, 2025, p. 321):\n- Addresses how undergraduate research articles often struggle with proper introductions\n- Notes the tendency toward indirectness and personal framing rather than addressing research gaps\n- Relevance: This supports paragraph 2 about the persuasive function of literature reviews, particularly the need to identify gaps in prior research (which undergraduates struggle with)\n\nThird quote (Feak, 2009, p. 10):\n- Discusses how literature reviews in manuscripts are criticized for either missing inputs or including too many references\n- Emphasizes that literature reviews must contribute to the \"argumentative shape\" of introductions\n- Notes that literature reviews should lead to establishing relevance of new research\n- Relevance: This directly supports paragraph 2 about the persuasive function of literature reviews\n\nAnalysis:\n- These quotes provide good support for paragraphs 1 and 2 regarding the persuasive nature of research writing and the specific function of literature reviews\n- They particularly support the claim that literature reviews must establish relevance and identify gaps in research\n- However, they don't fully address all the needed literature areas in your list\n\nMissing coverage:\n1. Source Selection and Authority (paragraph 3)\n2. Abductive Reasoning in Research (paragraph 4)\n3. Disciplinary Knowledge Construction (paragraph 5)\n4. Critical Reading Practices (paragraph 6)\n5. Human Judgment in Research (paragraph 7)\n\nI should acknowledge that these quotes are useful for the first part of the section but point out that we'll need additional sources for the remaining paragraphs. I should also evaluate how well they address the specific claims and warrants in the outline.\n\nLooking at these block quotes, I can see they're valuable for addressing part of our needs, but they have limitations:\n\nFor the rhetoric of science and literature review methods (paragraphs 1-2):\n- Kelly (2003) effectively establishes how disciplinary writing requires specialized argumentative practices - supporting our claim about research writing's persuasive function. It highlights the judgment needed to engage with \"community standards\" and \"disciplinary standards.\"\n- Rochma (2025) cleverly contrasts failed approaches (personal challenges) with proper ones (addressing research gaps) - supporting our warrant about normative judgments.\n- Feak (2009) directly supports our claim that literature reviews must contribute to \"argumentative shape\" and establish relevance - precisely the persuasive function we're identifying.\n\nHowever, these quotes don't adequately cover:\n1. Source selection as intellectual act (paragraph 3) - We need Wilson or library science literature on scholarly authority evaluation\n2. Abductive reasoning (paragraph 4) - Nothing connecting to Peirce\n3. Context flattening (paragraph 5) - Missing Becher & Trowler or Knorr Cetina\n4. Critical engagement (paragraph 6) - No sources on critical reading practices\n5. Human judgment (paragraph 7) - Polanyi or Collins on tacit knowledge\n\nI suggest we use these quotes to build paragraphs 1-2, while continuing to search for sources to cover the remaining paragraphs. The quotes establish the persuasive and normative nature of literature reviews, but they don't address how this connects to AI's specific judgment deficiencies in later paragraphs.\n\nWhat specific aspect would you like to focus on next? Should we draft paragraphs 1-2 using these quotes, or continue searching for sources for the remaining paragraphs?",

It highlights the judgment needed to engage with \"community standards\" and \"disciplinary standards.\"\n- Rochma (2025) cleverly contrasts failed approaches (personal challenges) with proper ones (addressing research gaps) - supporting our warrant about normative judgments.\n- Feak (2009) directly supports our claim that literature reviews must contribute to \"argumentative shape\" and establish relevance - precisely the persuasive function we're identifying.\n\nHowever, these quotes don't adequately cover:\n1. Source selection as intellectual act (paragraph 3) - We need Wilson or library science literature on scholarly authority evaluation\n2. Abductive reasoning (paragraph 4) - Nothing connecting to Peirce\n3. Context flattening (paragraph 5) - Missing Becher & Trowler or Knorr Cetina\n4. Critical engagement (paragraph 6) - No sources on critical reading practices\n5. Human judgment (paragraph 7) - Polanyi or Collins on tacit knowledge\n\nI suggest we use these quotes to build paragraphs 1-2, while continuing to search for sources to cover the remaining paragraphs. The quotes establish the persuasive and normative nature of literature reviews, but they don't address how this connects to AI's specific judgment deficiencies in later paragraphs.\n\nWhat specific aspect would you like to focus on next? Should we draft paragraphs 1-2 using these quotes, or continue searching for sources for the remaining paragraphs?",

Paragraphs 1-2 (Research Writing and Persuasive Function of Literature Reviews)\n   - We have quotes from Kelly (2003), Rochma (2025), and Feak (2009)\n   - These establish the persuasive and argumentative nature of literature reviews\n   - Good to proceed with these paragraphs\n\n2. Paragraph 3 (Source Selection as Intellectual Act)\n   - We'll reference Wilson (1983) and Fritch (2001)\n   - Plus the real-world example of Deep Research failing to assess cognitive authority\n   - This is sufficient without extensive quotes\n\n3. Paragraph 4 (Abductive Reasoning)\n   - We've agreed to make this a bridging paragraph\n   - Will link back to section 2.2.2 rather than repeat material\n   - Brief connection to research gap identification\n   - No new literature needed, just referencing earlier section\n\n4. Paragraph 5 (Context Flattening)\n   - You've indicated this is based on your observations\n   - No additional literature needed\n   - Can be combined with paragraph 4 as a subclaim\n   - Will be referenced in results section later\n\n5. Paragraphs 6-7 (Technoscholasticism and Human Judgment)\n   - These will connect to the larger paper\n   - No additional literature needed\n   - Will tie everything back to the main thesis\n\nThe revised outline should be more streamlined, potentially combining some paragraphs and focusing on the key claims, evidence, and warrants without unnecessary expansion. It sounds like we're moving from a 7-paragraph structure to perhaps 4-5 paragraphs by combining some elements.\n\nYou're right - we're developing the outline at this stage, not drafting the actual text. I agree we're ready to revise the outline.\n\nBased on our discussion:\n\n1. Para 1-2: Research writing/Literature reviews as persuasive (using Kelly, Rochma, Feak)\n   - Claims about dual functions (situating + novelty)\n   - Evidence from rhetorical studies of academic writing\n   - Warrant connecting to judgment requirements\n\n2.

Paragraphs 1-2 (Research Writing and Persuasive Function of Literature Reviews)\n   - We have quotes from Kelly (2003), Rochma (2025), and Feak (2009)\n   - These establish the persuasive and argumentative nature of literature reviews\n   - Good to proceed with these paragraphs\n\n2. Paragraph 3 (Source Selection as Intellectual Act)\n   - We'll reference Wilson (1983) and Fritch (2001)\n   - Plus the real-world example of Deep Research failing to assess cognitive authority\n   - This is sufficient without extensive quotes\n\n3. Paragraph 4 (Abductive Reasoning)\n   - We've agreed to make this a bridging paragraph\n   - Will link back to section 2.2.2 rather than repeat material\n   - Brief connection to research gap identification\n   - No new literature needed, just referencing earlier section\n\n4. Paragraph 5 (Context Flattening)\n   - You've indicated this is based on your observations\n   - No additional literature needed\n   - Can be combined with paragraph 4 as a subclaim\n   - Will be referenced in results section later\n\n5. Paragraphs 6-7 (Technoscholasticism and Human Judgment)\n   - These will connect to the larger paper\n   - No additional literature needed\n   - Will tie everything back to the main thesis\n\nThe revised outline should be more streamlined, potentially combining some paragraphs and focusing on the key claims, evidence, and warrants without unnecessary expansion.

I'll develop each paragraph thoughtfully, incorporating the sources we've discussed and maintaining the academic register consistent with the rest of the paper.\n\n## Paragraph 1: Introduction - Research Writing and Literature Reviews\nThis paragraph needs to establish that research writing, particularly literature reviews, serves both informative and persuasive functions. I'll use Kelly (2003) to support this claim. The paragraph should be concise but set up the foundation for why AI approaches to research are fundamentally limited.\n\n## Paragraph 2: Beyond Information - The Persuasive Function\nThis paragraph will elaborate on how literature reviews establish disciplinary situation and identify unanswered questions. I'll incorporate Rochma (2025) and Feak (2009) to support these claims, and make the connection to how AI systems struggle with the negative inference required for identifying genuine gaps.\n\n## Paragraph 3: Source Selection as Intellectual Act\nThis paragraph will focus on discernment in source selection, referencing Wilson (1983) and Fritch (2001) on cognitive authority. I'll include examples from Deep Research testing to illustrate how AI fails to assess source credibility despite explicit instructions.\n\n## Paragraph 4: Bridging to Abductive Reasoning\nThis will be a brief paragraph connecting back to section 2.2.2 on abductive reasoning, emphasizing how this deficit undermines research gap identification.\n\n## Paragraph 5: Connection to Technoscholasticism\nThis paragraph will connect these limitations to the concept of technoscholasticism introduced earlier, linking to the correspondence with reality deficit discussed in section 2.2.3.\n\nIn the conclusion, I'll incorporate some of the thoughts from the removed paragraph 7 into the end of paragraph 5, emphasizing how AI systems remain tools requiring human judgment.\n\nNow I'll draft the full section:\n\n### Draft:\n\n\\subsection{Nature of Research Work}\n\nResearch writing, particularly literature reviews, serves functions far beyond mere information aggregation and description. As Kelly et al. (2003) observe, effective scholarly writing requires mastery of \"specific argumentative practices\" within disciplinary contexts, where authors must learn \"what kinds of claims people make; how they advance them; what literatures people rely on and how these literatures are invoked within arguments\" (p. 30). This dual nature of research writing\u2014simultaneously informative and persuasive\u2014reveals a fundamental gap in AI research capabilities. While large language models excel at accumulating and synthesizing textual information, they fundamentally lack the capacity to engage in the normative judgments required for genuine scholarly persuasion.\n\nLiterature reviews specifically establish two critical argumentative elements: situating research within a disciplinary context and demonstrating that the research question has not been adequately addressed. Rochma (2025) identifies that unsuccessful academic writing often frames \"studies as responses to personal challenges rather than addressing gaps in prior research\" (p. 321). Similarly, Feak (2009) notes that effective literature reviews must \"contribute to the argumentative shape of the introduction\" and lead \"to the conclusion that the new research is relevant\" (p. 10). These persuasive functions require normative judgments about disciplinary relevance and novelty\u2014judgments that AI systems are not designed to make. When users prompt AI systems for literature reviews, the resulting outputs typically fall within what Rochma characterizes as the \"personal challenges\" mode (\"Here is what I found\") rather than identifying genuine gaps in the literature. The warrant for this limitation is clear: AI systems are not designed to work with the negative inference required for identifying what is absent yet significant within a body of literature.\n\nEffective research further requires discernment in source selection that goes beyond pattern matching. Wilson's (1983) concept of \"cognitive authority\" and Fritch's (2001) work on authority evaluation emphasize that researchers must assess \"how much cognitive authority to ascribe to a particular individual or institution\" and consider \"quality and credibility\" when working with information sources (Fritch, 2001, p. 499). In testing Deep Research implementations, we observed consistent failures to assess source credibility despite explicit instructions to \"evaluate source and author quality\" and \"avoid those from paper mills and predatory journals.\" The systems demonstrated no evidence of checking bibliographies, examining citation networks, or evaluating author credentials. Instead, they matched patterns of academic-looking content without evaluating actual authority. In one telling example, a system referred to a South Asian colleague only by name, failing to provide any contextual information about her expertise or qualifications despite explicit prompting to provide \"context and qualifications of the author.\"\n\nThese source selection deficiencies connect directly to the abductive reasoning deficit established in section 2.2.2. Without the capacity for what Peirce termed the \"flash\" of insight or experience of \"surprise\" when encountering unexpected patterns, AI systems cannot identify meaningful research gaps. The absence of abductive reasoning undermines the very foundation of novel research identification\u2014the ability to notice what is missing yet significant within existing knowledge structures. This limitation is not merely technical but epistemological; statistical pattern completion fundamentally differs from the generative act of identifying unexplored territory in scholarly landscapes.\n\nThe limitations observed in AI research capabilities exemplify the technoscholasticism described earlier in this paper. Just as medieval scholastics privileged textual authority over empirical verification, AI systems treat well-formatted academic texts as inherently authoritative regardless of their actual credibility or relevance. This directly connects to the correspondence with reality deficit discussed in section 2.2.3\u2014the inability to evaluate knowledge claims against real-world evidence. The pattern of judgment deficiencies across epistemic humility, inductive reasoning, and correspondence with reality manifests clearly in AI's approach to research tasks. While these systems offer potential utility for information retrieval and initial organization, they remain tools requiring human judgment at critical junctures in the research process. The essential functions of disciplinary relevance assessment, authority evaluation, and gap identification cannot be delegated to statistical models without sacrificing the fundamental judgment that drives scholarly advancement.\n\n### Review and Counterarguments:\n\nLet me review this draft and consider potential counterarguments:\n\n1. **Counterargument**: AI systems are rapidly improving and may soon develop capabilities that address these limitations. The paper may be outdated quickly.\n   **Response**: While capabilities are evolving, the fundamental architectural limitations (next-token prediction, training on existing text) suggest these judgment deficiencies are not merely implementation issues but conceptual constraints.\n\n2. **Counterargument**: Some might argue that humans often perform poorly on these judgment tasks as well, and the standard being applied to AI is unrealistically high.\n   **Response**: The paper isn't claiming that all human researchers excel at these judgments, but rather that human judgment (even if imperfect) is necessary and cannot be replaced by current AI approaches.\n\n3. **Counterargument**: The examples provided might be seen as cherry-picked failures rather than systematic limitations.\n   **Response**: This concern is valid - the draft should be more explicit about the systematic nature of these observations across multiple tests and systems.\n\n4. **Counterargument**: The technoscholasticism analogy might seem forced or overdrawn.\n   **Response**: The connection could be made more precise by focusing specifically on how both medieval scholasticism and AI privilege textual patterns over empirical verification.\n\n5. **Counterargument**: The section might seem repetitive with earlier discussions of judgment deficiencies.\n   **Response**: I need to ensure that this section focuses specifically on research contexts rather than rehashing general judgment limitations.\n\nLet me now revise the draft to address these concerns:\n\n### Edited Draft:\n\n\\subsection{Nature of Research Work}\n\nResearch writing, particularly literature reviews, serves functions far beyond mere information aggregation and description.

These persuasive functions require normative judgments about disciplinary relevance and novelty\u2014judgments that current AI architectures are not designed to make. The predominant pattern observed across multiple AI research implementations is the production of what Rochma characterizes as the \"personal challenges\" mode (\"Here is what I found\") rather than identifying genuine gaps in the literature. This limitation stems from a fundamental constraint: next-token prediction models are inherently designed to work with positive pattern completion rather than the negative inference required for identifying what is absent yet significant within a body of literature.\n\nEffective research further requires discernment in source selection that transcends pattern matching. Wilson's (1983) concept of \"cognitive authority\" and Fritch's (2001) work on authority evaluation emphasize that researchers must assess \"how much cognitive authority to ascribe to a particular individual or institution\" and consider \"quality and credibility\" when working with information sources (Fritch, 2001, p. 499). In systematic testing of current Deep Research implementations from multiple vendors, we observed consistent failures to assess source credibility despite explicit instructions to \"evaluate source and author quality\" and \"avoid those from paper mills and predatory journals.\" The systems demonstrated no evidence of checking bibliographies, examining citation networks, or evaluating author credentials\u2014precisely the evaluative steps that Wilson and Fritch identify as essential to cognitive authority assessment. Instead, they matched patterns of academic-looking content without evaluating actual authority, a limitation observed across multiple prompting strategies and system versions.\n\nThese source selection deficiencies connect directly to the abductive reasoning deficit established in section 2.2.2.

The pattern of judgment deficiencies across epistemic humility, inductive reasoning, and correspondence with reality manifests specifically in research contexts as an inability to make the normative evaluations required for genuine scholarship. While AI systems offer utility for information retrieval and initial organization, they function best as tools augmenting human judgment rather than autonomous research agents. The essential functions of disciplinary relevance assessment, authority evaluation, and gap identification require human judgments that cannot be replicated through statistical token prediction, regardless of how sophisticated these models become.\n\nI think this revised draft addresses the counterarguments while maintaining the academic register and focusing on the specific nature of research work rather than repeating general judgment limitations. The section now:\n\n1. Emphasizes the systematic nature of the observations across multiple systems and tests\n2. Makes more precise connections to the concepts introduced earlier\n3. Focuses specifically on research contexts rather than repeating general judgment observations\n4. Clarifies that the limitations are architectural/epistemological rather than merely implementation issues\n5. Incorporates elements from the removed conclusion paragraph into paragraph 5\n\nThe overall flow is also improved, with clear connections between paragraphs and a strong logical progression. The edited draft is around 900 words, which seems appropriate for this subsection.\n\n# Draft for Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work\n\nAfter careful consideration and editing to address potential counterarguments, here's my proposed draft for the Nature of Research Work subsection:\n\n```latex\n\\subsection{Nature of Research Work}\n\nResearch writing, particularly literature reviews, serves functions far beyond mere information aggregation and description.

While large language models excel at accumulating and synthesizing textual information, they fundamentally lack the capacity to engage in the normative judgments required for genuine scholarly persuasion.\n\nLiterature reviews specifically establish two critical argumentative elements: situating research within a disciplinary context and demonstrating that the research question has not been adequately addressed. Rochma (2025) identifies that unsuccessful academic writing often frames \"studies as responses to personal challenges rather than addressing gaps in prior research\" (p. 321). Similarly, Feak (2009) notes that effective literature reviews must \"contribute to the argumentative shape of the introduction\" and lead \"to the conclusion that the new research is relevant\" (p. 10). These persuasive functions require normative judgments about disciplinary relevance and novelty\u2014judgments that current AI architectures are not designed to make. The predominant pattern observed across multiple AI research implementations is the production of what Rochma characterizes as the \"personal challenges\" mode (\"Here is what I found\") rather than identifying genuine gaps in the literature. This limitation stems from a fundamental constraint: next-token prediction models are inherently designed to work with positive pattern completion rather than the negative inference required for identifying what is absent yet significant within a body of literature.\n\nEffective research further requires discernment in source selection that transcends pattern matching. Wilson's (1983) concept of \"cognitive authority\" and Fritch's (2001) work on authority evaluation emphasize that researchers must assess \"how much cognitive authority to ascribe to a particular individual or institution\" and consider \"quality and credibility\" when working with information sources (Fritch, 2001, p. 499). In systematic testing of current Deep Research implementations from multiple vendors, we observed consistent failures to assess source credibility despite explicit instructions to \"evaluate source and author quality\" and \"avoid those from paper mills and predatory journals.\" The systems demonstrated no evidence of checking bibliographies, examining citation networks, or evaluating author credentials\u2014precisely the evaluative steps that Wilson and Fritch identify as essential to cognitive authority assessment. Instead, they matched patterns of academic-looking content without evaluating actual authority, a limitation observed across multiple prompting strategies and system versions.\n\nThese source selection deficiencies connect directly to the abductive reasoning deficit established in section 2.2.2. Without the capacity for what Peirce termed the \"flash\" of insight or experience of \"surprise\" when encountering unexpected patterns, AI systems cannot identify meaningful research gaps. The absence of abductive reasoning undermines the very foundation of novel research identification\u2014the ability to notice what is missing yet significant within existing knowledge structures. This limitation is not merely technical but epistemological; statistical pattern completion fundamentally differs from the generative act of identifying unexplored territory in scholarly landscapes.\n\nThe limitations observed in AI research capabilities exemplify the technoscholasticism described earlier in this paper. Just as medieval scholastics privileged textual authority over empirical verification, current AI systems treat well-formatted academic texts as inherently authoritative without evaluating their actual credibility or relevance. This directly connects to the correspondence with reality deficit discussed in section 2.2.3\u2014the inability to evaluate knowledge claims against real-world evidence. The pattern of judgment deficiencies across epistemic humility, inductive reasoning, and correspondence with reality manifests specifically in research contexts as an inability to make the normative evaluations required for genuine scholarship. While AI systems offer utility for information retrieval and initial organization, they function best as tools augmenting human judgment rather than autonomous research agents. The essential functions of disciplinary relevance assessment, authority evaluation, and gap identification require human judgments that cannot be replicated through statistical token prediction, regardless of how sophisticated these models become.\n\nI think this revised draft addresses the counterarguments while maintaining the academic register and focusing on the specific nature of research work rather than repeating general judgment limitations. The section now:\n\n1. Emphasizes the systematic nature of the observations across multiple systems and tests\n2. Makes more precise connections to the concepts introduced earlier\n3. Focuses specifically on research contexts rather than repeating general judgment observations\n4. Clarifies that the limitations are architectural/epistemological rather than merely implementation issues\n5. Incorporates elements from the removed conclusion paragraph into paragraph 5\n\nThe overall flow is also improved, with clear connections between paragraphs and a strong logical progression.

In systematic testing of current Deep Research implementations from multiple vendors, we observed consistent failures to assess source credibility despite explicit instructions to \"evaluate source and author quality\" and \"avoid those from paper mills and predatory journals.\" The systems demonstrated no evidence of checking author bibliographies, examining citation networks, or evaluating author credentials. These requested checking-tasks are precisely the evaluative steps that Wilson and Fritch identify as essential to cognitive authority assessment. Instead, they matched patterns of academic formatting, in the McLuhan sense, looking at content without evaluating source authority, a limitation observed across multiple prompting strategies and infrastructures.\n\nThese source selection deficiencies connect directly to the deficit in abductive reasoning established earlier (Subsection \\ref{subsub:inductive}). Without the capacity for what Peirce termed the flash of insight or experience of surprise when encountering unexpected patterns, AI systems cannot identify meaningful research gaps. The absence of abductive reasoning undermines the very foundation of novel research identification: the ability to notice what is missing yet significant within existing knowledge structures.

Citation formatting issues: I should have used \\textcite{} and \\parencite{} instead of regular citations.\n\n2.

Marketing claims vs. empirical performance of agent tool-chains\n   c. Architectural limits of next-token generation & (illusory) self-refinement\n   d.

The user seems most interested in the first area (taxonomies of agency), which aligns with the theoretical notes they shared about agentic systems.\n\nThe current Section 2.3 is about the \"Nature of Research Work\" - focusing on why research requires judgment that AI lacks. The taxonomies of agency would fit better in Section 2.1 on Agency vs. Task Decomposition, not in this section.\n\nGiven that they've already revised the text I drafted and seem generally satisfied with it (with minor formatting changes), they're probably not looking for a complete rewrite of 2.3.\n\nInstead, they're considering whether to add a new subsection about taxonomies of agency elsewhere in the paper, perhaps as 2.1 or 2.4.\n\nI should:\n1. Acknowledge the formatting issues\n2. Provide thoughts on whether a new section on taxonomies of agency would strengthen the paper\n3.

The critique table suggests 6 areas where the paper might need more literature:\n\n   a. Broader taxonomies of agency and the \"tool \u2194 partner\" debate\n   b. Marketing claims vs. empirical performance of agent tool-chains\n   c. Architectural limits of next-token generation & (illusory) self-refinement\n   d. Autoethnography standards for AI-tool studies\n   e. Information-literacy & source-criticism scholarship\n   f. Human-AI collaboration & confidence-aware interface design\n\n3. The user seems most interested in the first area (taxonomies of agency), which aligns with the theoretical notes they shared about agentic systems.\n\nThe current Section 2.3 is about the \"Nature of Research Work\" - focusing on why research requires judgment that AI lacks. The taxonomies of agency would fit better in Section 2.1 on Agency vs. Task Decomposition, not in this section.\n\nGiven that they've already revised the text I drafted and seem generally satisfied with it (with minor formatting changes), they're probably not looking for a complete rewrite of 2.3.\n\nInstead, they're considering whether to add a new subsection about taxonomies of agency elsewhere in the paper, perhaps as 2.1 or 2.4.\n\nI should:\n1. Acknowledge the formatting issues\n2. Provide thoughts on whether a new section on taxonomies of agency would strengthen the paper\n3.

Similarly, \\textcite{russell_artificial_2021} characterize agents as systems that \"operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals\" (pp. 21-22). These definitions emphasize autonomy, environmental perception, and\u2014crucially\u2014goal pursuit with assessment of outcomes.\n\nThe philosophical perspective on agency further emphasizes the importance of internal deliberative processes. \\textcite{bratman_intention_1999} identifies reasoning-centered commitment as a core component of agency, requiring: (1) a tendency not to reconsider intentions except given new relevant information; (2) engagement in practical reasoning about means and methods; and (3) exclusion of options incompatible with executing the intention. This framework explains why meaningful agency requires not only goal setting but sustained, consistent reasoning about goal achievement\u2014precisely what current systems lack. Despite sophisticated task decomposition, contemporary \"agentic\" systems demonstrate little commitment to consistent reasoning or robust self-assessment of their own plans.\n\nEarly debates in human-computer interaction similarly established distinctions between tools and agents that remain relevant today. When \\textcite{ben_shneiderman_direct_1997} debated the merits of agent-based interfaces, Maes described software agents as systems that would \"know the individual user's habits, preferences, and interests,\" be \"proactive\" by taking initiative based on user interests, remain \"long-lived\" while running autonomously, and \"adapt\" by tracking changing interests (p. 49). While current Deep Research implementations satisfy some of these criteria\u2014particularly operating on the user's behalf\u2014they fundamentally lack true initiative, preference understanding, or adaptivity beyond the immediate context window.\n\nExamining contemporary marketing claims against these established frameworks reveals a significant conceptual gap. Current systems more closely resemble the limited IBM Agent definition as \"software entities that carry out some set of operations on behalf of a user... with some degree of independence or autonomy\" \\parencite[23]{franklin_is_1997}. This definition, notably more modest than those requiring consistent reasoning or outcome assessment, better characterizes what current systems actually achieve. As \\textcite{dung_understanding_2024} argues, meaningful agency profiles must be evaluated across multiple dimensions including goal-directedness, autonomy, and reasoning capacity\u2014with current systems showing significant limitations across these axes.\n\nThe three categories proposed in this paper\u2014tool-using, goal-following, and goal-setting systems\u2014all exist on an agency spectrum, but crucially differ in their judgment capabilities. Tool-using systems may decompose tasks but cannot assess goal achievement; goal-following systems incorporate judgment about progress and success; goal-setting systems autonomously determine and adjust their own goals. Current \"agentic\" implementations, despite marketing claims, operate primarily at the tool-using level. As \\textcite{floridi_ai_2025} observes, these systems represent a new form of \"agency without intelligence\"\u2014capable of complex operations but lacking the reflective self-assessment necessary for genuine agency.\n\nThe fundamental issue is not merely terminological but practical: claiming agency without the capability to assess goal completion implies a level of trust entirely unwarranted in the software. When systems decompose tasks impressively but lack judgment about whether those tasks genuinely accomplish user goals, they create a dangerous illusion of capability. This limitation connects directly to the judgment deficiencies outlined in previous sections\u2014without epistemic humility, inductive reasoning, and correspondence with reality, no system can meaningfully evaluate its own success against complex real-world objectives.\n```\n\nThis draft:\n1.

I'll also make sure to incorporate the OpenAI quote from earlier in the paper.\n\nFor Dung, we now have specific aspects of agency to incorporate:\n- Goal-directedness as a minimal sense of goal-pursuit (p.452)\n- Planning dimension as making temporally dependent decisions (p.454)\n\nThese concepts can help us frame the spectrum of agency from tool-using to goal-following to goal-setting.\n\nFor OpenAI, I'll need to incorporate their marketing definition of \"agentic\" from earlier in the paper.

ChatGPT will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources\"\n- IBM Agent definition: \"Intelligent agents are software entities that carry out some set of operations on behalf of a user... with some degree of independence or autonomy...\" (p.23)\n\n## Paragraph 3: Dimensions of Agency and Goal Assessment\n\n**Claim:** All three proposed categories (tool-using, goal-following, goal-setting) exist on an agency spectrum, but differ critically in their ability to evaluate goal completion\n**Warrant:** The ability to assess goal completion is essential for warranted trust in autonomous systems\n**Evidence:**\n- Dung (2024): Goal-directedness involves states \"the system aims for in many different kinds of situation and that it seeks to maintain in the face of perturbation\" (p.452)\n- Dung (2024): Planning dimension involves \"decisions that are temporally dependent upon one another to achieve a goal and/or make predictions over a long time horizon\" (p.454)\n- Brief nod to Floridi (2025) on AI as agency without genuine intelligence\n\n## Paragraph 4: Reasoning-Centered Commitment in Agency\n\n**Claim:** Current task-following systems lack reasoning-centered commitment required for genuine agency\n**Warrant:** Without this commitment, systems cannot maintain plan consistency with their reasoning\n**Evidence:**\n- Bratman (1999): Intention requires commitment not to revise intentions except for relevant new information and engagement in practical reasoning about execution\n- Observations of Deep Research systems wandering off-task, failing to check work, and ending abruptly\n\n## Paragraph 5: Surface-Level Criteria Without Deeper Capabilities\n\n**Claim:** Deep Research systems exist in a middle ground where they meet some definitional criteria for agency while lacking the judgment capabilities for true autonomy\n**Warrant:** This distinction determines the appropriate level of trust and delegation\n**Evidence:**\n- Empirical observations of systems' inability to determine when goals have been accomplished\n- The connection between this deficiency and the three dimensions of judgment established earlier in the paper\n\n## Key Synthesis for the Section\n\n**Primary Claim:** Current \"agentic\" systems are task-following tools without the capability for goal-assessment that genuine agency requires\n**Primary Warrant:** This distinction isn't merely semantic - it determines the appropriate level of trust and delegation\n**Connection to Paper's Thesis:** The judgment deficit directly undermines the goal-assessment capability required for true agency",

These definitions impose substantive requirements that far exceed task decomposition.\n\nCurrent \"agentic\" marketing, however, aligns more closely with limited service definitions than genuine agency. Consider OpenAI's claim that \"Deep Research will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst\" \\parencite{openai_introducing_2025}. This description more closely resembles the IBM Agent definition of \"software entities that carry out some set of operations on behalf of a user or another program with some degree of independence or autonomy\" \\parencite[23]{franklin_is_1997}. The terminological shift is consequential because it creates unrealistic expectations about system capabilities and appropriate levels of trust.\n\nThe systems examined in this paper exist on what Dung terms an \"agency spectrum,\" differentiated primarily by their capacity for goal assessment.

Floridi similarly distinguishes between genuine agency and mere agency-like behaviors in contemporary AI systems \\parencite{floridi_ai_2025}.

Current task-following systems lack this commitment, evidenced by their tendency to wander off-task, fail to check work, or end processes abruptly. The absence of reasoning-centered commitment undermines claims to genuine agency.\n\nWhile Deep Research systems may satisfy some surface-level agency criteria, such as acting on behalf of users, they lack genuine initiative and user understanding. Shneiderman and Maes identify software agents as \"proactive... taking initiative... long-lived... adaptive\" \\parencite[49]{ben_shneiderman_direct_1997}, but current systems are limited to pattern matching within immediate prompt contexts rather than developing true models of user preferences or needs. This distinction is not merely semantic\u2014it determines the appropriate level of trust and delegation. Systems incapable of goal assessment should be treated as sophisticated tools rather than autonomous agents, regardless of marketing terminology. The judgment deficits identified throughout this paper directly undermine the goal-assessment capability required for true agency, placing current Deep Research implementations firmly in the tool-using rather than goal-following category despite their superficial resemblance to historical definitions of software agents.\n```",
