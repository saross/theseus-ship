Section 2 establishes our analytical framework, articulating how judgment operates in research contexts and why current architectures preclude its development. Section 3 details our autoethnographic methodology, justifying this approach for capturing the situated practice of AI tool use. Section 4 presents case studies of multiple AI research implementations, documenting specific failure patterns that manifest our theoretical predictions. Section 5 synthesises these findings, demonstrating how observed failures constitute compelling evidence for technoscholasticism as a fundamental rather than incidental characteristic. Finally, Section 6 translates our critique into design requirements for research tools that acknowledge these constraints, proposing architectural compensations for inherent judgment deficits. Through this progression, we build the case that recognising technoscholasticism as a defining feature rather than a correctable flaw enables more effective integration of AI tools into scholarly practice.",
