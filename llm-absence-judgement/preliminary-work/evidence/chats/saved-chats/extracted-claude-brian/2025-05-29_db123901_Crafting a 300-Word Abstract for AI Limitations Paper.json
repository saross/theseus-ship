Outlines the paper's contributions and recommendations\n7. Challenges the \"agentic\" marketing claims\n\nThe abstract maintains academic tone while being accessible and clearly conveying the paper's core arguments.The abstract has been created with exactly 300 words. It captures the paper's core argument about \"technoscholasticism\" as a framework for understanding AI limitations, specifies the three judgment deficiencies (epistemic humility, inductive capacity, and correspondence with reality), includes concrete examples from your Digital Humanities case studies, and outlines both the critical analysis and constructive recommendations for tool design.\n\nThe word count has been verified using JavaScript to ensure it meets the 300-word requirement precisely.",

Through autoethnographic investigation of frontier models deployed in February 2025\u2014including OpenAI's Deep Research, Anthropic's Claude Research, Google's Gemini Deep Research, and others\u2014we demonstrate that these systems lack three crucial dimensions of judgment essential for authentic research: epistemic humility (recognising knowledge boundaries), inductive capacity (identifying meaningful patterns and gaps), and correspondence with reality (evaluating claims against empirical evidence rather than textual authority).\n\nOur analysis reveals that, like medieval scholastics who privileged authoritative texts over empirical investigation, current AI research tools exhibit a \"digital scholasticism\" that accepts well-formatted academic sources as inherently authoritative without critical assessment. This technoscholastic worldview explains why systems with access to vast knowledge corpora fail to generate novel insights or identify genuine research gaps. Through concrete case studies\u2014particularly examining Digital Humanities programs in Australia\u2014we document how these tools consistently present defunct initiatives as active, ignore temporal context, and fail to recognise \"useful absences\" of evidence that would signal program discontinuation to human researchers.\n\nWhile acknowledging potential \"mundane utility\" for specific bounded tasks like initial literature gathering and data collection, we argue these systems function as sophisticated tools requiring extensive human judgment rather than autonomous research agents. The paper proposes architectural and methodological requirements for more effective research tools that acknowledge these inherent constraints, including multi-threaded cognition, explicit judgment checkpoints, systematic source evaluation, and transparent documentation of decision-making processes. Our findings contribute both to theoretical understanding of AI epistemology and practical approaches to scholarly tool design, establishing realistic expectations for human-AI collaboration in research contexts while challenging inflated claims of agency in current implementations.",

Looking at the style guide, I should use:\n   - \"analyse\" not \"analyze\" \u2713\n   - \"recognise\" not \"recognize\" \u2713 \n   - \"programs\" not \"programmes\" \u2713\n   - \"judgment\" not \"judgement\" - in Australian English, both are acceptable but \"judgment\" is preferred in legal/academic contexts\n\nThe revised abstract:\n- Eliminates all em-dashes \n- Has good sentence variety (short, medium, and longer sentences)\n- Uses active voice primarily\n- Maintains Australian spelling\n- Is exactly 300 words\n- Follows the style guide's principles\n\nThe revision looks good and follows all requirements.I've rewritten the abstract to eliminate em-dashes and improve sentence variety. The revision now uses a mix of short, punchy sentences (\"This technoscholastic worldview explains a puzzling phenomenon.\") and longer, more complex ones for nuanced points. All em-dashes have been replaced with alternative punctuation or restructured sentences.\n\nThe abstract maintains Australian spelling throughout (analyse, recognise, programs) and achieves exactly 300 words while preserving all key content about technoscholasticism, the three judgment deficiencies, and practical recommendations for research tool design.",

We conducted autoethnographic investigations of frontier models deployed in February 2025, including OpenAI's Deep Research, Anthropic's Claude Research, and Google's Gemini Deep Research. Our analysis demonstrates that these systems lack three crucial dimensions of judgment essential for authentic research: epistemic humility (recognising knowledge boundaries), inductive capacity (identifying meaningful patterns and gaps), and correspondence with reality (evaluating claims against empirical evidence rather than textual authority).\n\nCurrent AI research tools exhibit a \"digital scholasticism\" that parallels medieval scholarly practices. Like historical scholars who privileged authoritative texts over empirical investigation, these systems accept well-formatted academic sources as inherently authoritative without critical assessment. This technoscholastic worldview explains a puzzling phenomenon. Systems with access to vast knowledge corpora consistently fail to generate novel insights or identify genuine research gaps. We document this pattern through concrete case studies, particularly our examination of Digital Humanities programs in Australia. The tools consistently presented defunct initiatives as active programs. They ignored temporal context and failed to recognise \"useful absences\" of evidence that would signal program discontinuation to human researchers.\n\nThese systems demonstrate potential \"mundane utility\" for specific bounded tasks like initial literature gathering and structured data collection. However, they function as sophisticated tools requiring extensive human judgment rather than autonomous research agents. We propose detailed architectural and methodological requirements for more effective research tools. These explicitly acknowledge inherent epistemological constraints through multi-threaded cognition architectures, strategic human judgment checkpoints, systematic historiographical source evaluation, context-aware memory management, and transparent documentation of automated decision-making. Our findings contribute theoretical understanding of AI epistemology through the technoscholasticism framework. They also provide practical approaches to scholarly tool design, establishing realistic expectations for productive human-AI collaboration while directly challenging inflated claims of genuine agency.`;\n\n// Count words\nconst wordCount = finalAbstractText.split(/\\s+/).filter(word => word.length > 0).length;\nconsole.log(`Final abstract word count: ${wordCount} words`);\nconsole.log(`\\nAbstract successfully revised with:`);\nconsole.log(`- No em-dashes`);\nconsole.log(`- Varied sentence structure`);\nconsole.log(`- Australian spelling throughout`);\nconsole.log(`- Clear, direct academic writing`);\n"
