(Not a confabulation, to be clear, but merely accepting the textual claims at face value, and extrapolating). \n\nThe fundamentals, thinking about it, are:\n1. Not mistaking a claim for a trend\n2. Looking at authorship and temporality\n3. Relating claims to their own experience\n4. A position of scepticism, rather than uncritical acceptance.\n\nThe fundamental is that texts are produced by people, they have an interpretation and a representation of the real which supports the specific needs of that person or institution at the time. When we read claims by people, those claims are contextualised by our understanding of the author, the circumstances of writing, and the putative audience of the work. \n\nOf course, we humans may be lazy as well! I am not claiming that AIs are uniquely bad at this. It's just that they do research like a concussed undergrad doing last-minute work. \"Find something that supports my vibe, take it as a fact, cite it, move on.\" \n\nHowever, there *is* a specific problem to LLMs. In my benchmarking, I've noticed that LLMs are very bad at model-of-mind-of-mind. (This is part of me testing for the successful capability to achieve deception, rather than roleplaying a moustache-twirling-villain). You (they) cannot hold contradictions well within the context window. This is the same flaw as prompt injection -- all input is trusted. In my testing, models I've tested are very bad at social deduction games, as they cannot achieve lies *while knowing the truth* because it requires holding both the understanding of the real, and the desired simulated understanding of the not-real. \n\nSo, this uncriticality of input means that anything \"read\" is \"trusted\" so long as it has the appropriate medium, in the McLuhan sense.",

          "text": "This is where things are sticky. I am aware of the problems of DH in Australia, so I know that what it claimed was flatly wrong. (Not a confabulation, to be clear, but merely accepting the textual claims at face value, and extrapolating). \n\nThe fundamentals, thinking about it, are:\n1. Not mistaking a claim for a trend\n2. Looking at authorship and temporality\n3. Relating claims to their own experience\n4. A position of scepticism, rather than uncritical acceptance.\n\nThe fundamental is that texts are produced by people, they have an interpretation and a representation of the real which supports the specific needs of that person or institution at the time. When we read claims by people, those claims are contextualised by our understanding of the author, the circumstances of writing, and the putative audience of the work. \n\nOf course, we humans may be lazy as well! I am not claiming that AIs are uniquely bad at this. It's just that they do research like a concussed undergrad doing last-minute work. \"Find something that supports my vibe, take it as a fact, cite it, move on.\" \n\nHowever, there *is* a specific problem to LLMs. In my benchmarking, I've noticed that LLMs are very bad at model-of-mind-of-mind. (This is part of me testing for the successful capability to achieve deception, rather than roleplaying a moustache-twirling-villain). You (they) cannot hold contradictions well within the context window. This is the same flaw as prompt injection -- all input is trusted. In my testing, models I've tested are very bad at social deduction games, as they cannot achieve lies *while knowing the truth* because it requires holding both the understanding of the real, and the desired simulated understanding of the not-real. \n\nSo, this uncriticality of input means that anything \"read\" is \"trusted\" so long as it has the appropriate medium, in the McLuhan sense.",

Inability to distinguish claims from trends\n  2. Failure to consider authorship and temporality\n  3. Cannot relate claims to experiential knowledge\n  4. Default position of acceptance rather than skepticism\n- Concrete examples from the Digital Humanities case study\n\n#### The Structural Limitation\n- Explain contextual limitations: inability to hold contradictions within context window\n- Poor performance at \"model-of-mind-of-mind\" tasks\n- All formatted input treated as trusted\n- No capacity for independent verification of claims\n\n#### Implications for Research\n- Contrast with human researchers who run experiments when encountering conflicting authorities\n- Note how LLMs never say \"I can't know\" or \"let's verify empirically\"\n- Emphasize that this isn't merely a technical limitation but a fundamental epistemological barrier\n- Connect to Frankfurt's concept of \"bullshit\" as indifference to truth",

      "text": "\nLet me consider the pros and cons of renaming this section to \"The Scholastic Fallacy\" through a proleptic analysis:\n\nPros of renaming:\n1. \"The Scholastic Fallacy\" is more specific and historically grounded than \"Correspondence with Reality\"\n2. It directly connects to the medieval scholarship parallel that is central to our argument\n3. It's a more distinctive term that might be more memorable for readers\n4. It better captures the specific critique about prioritizing textual authority over empirical verification\n5. It creates a parallel to the paper's overall \"technoscholasticism\" framework\n\nCons of renaming:\n1. \"Correspondence with Reality\" clearly signals this is about the relationship between AI outputs and the real world\n2. The broader section is about three dimensions of judgment (epistemic humility, induction, and correspondence with reality), so changing just this one might disrupt the parallel structure\n3. \"Scholastic Fallacy\" might be less immediately clear to readers unfamiliar with medieval scholarship\n4. Some readers might associate \"scholastic fallacy\" with Bourdieu's specific concept in sociology rather than our medieval reference\n5. The current title directly connects to the philosophical tradition of correspondence theories of truth\n\nPotential objections from readers:\n1. \"Why focus on medieval scholasticism when modern philosophy offers more relevant frameworks?\"\n2. \"Isn't 'scholastic fallacy' already a term from Bourdieu with a different meaning?\"\n3. \"The section covers broader issues than just scholasticism, like Carnapian confirmation\"\n4. \"The parallel structure of the three dimensions of judgment would be disrupted\"\n5. \"The title should indicate this is about AI's relationship to reality, which 'correspondence with reality' does clearly\"\n\nResponse to objections:\n1. The medieval scholastic parallel provides a uniquely apt historical precedent for the issues we're describing\n2. We can address the Bourdieu connection briefly to distinguish our usage\n3. We could use a title that combines elements: \"The Scholastic Fallacy: AI's Tenuous Correspondence with Reality\"\n4. We could maintain parallel structure by renaming all three subsections to focus on specific fallacies\n5. We can ensure the introduction to the section clearly establishes the connection to reality\n\nConsidering these points, I think renaming has merit but requires careful handling.

          "thinking": "\nLet me consider the pros and cons of renaming this section to \"The Scholastic Fallacy\" through a proleptic analysis:\n\nPros of renaming:\n1. \"The Scholastic Fallacy\" is more specific and historically grounded than \"Correspondence with Reality\"\n2. It directly connects to the medieval scholarship parallel that is central to our argument\n3. It's a more distinctive term that might be more memorable for readers\n4. It better captures the specific critique about prioritizing textual authority over empirical verification\n5. It creates a parallel to the paper's overall \"technoscholasticism\" framework\n\nCons of renaming:\n1. \"Correspondence with Reality\" clearly signals this is about the relationship between AI outputs and the real world\n2. The broader section is about three dimensions of judgment (epistemic humility, induction, and correspondence with reality), so changing just this one might disrupt the parallel structure\n3. \"Scholastic Fallacy\" might be less immediately clear to readers unfamiliar with medieval scholarship\n4. Some readers might associate \"scholastic fallacy\" with Bourdieu's specific concept in sociology rather than our medieval reference\n5. The current title directly connects to the philosophical tradition of correspondence theories of truth\n\nPotential objections from readers:\n1. \"Why focus on medieval scholasticism when modern philosophy offers more relevant frameworks?\"\n2. \"Isn't 'scholastic fallacy' already a term from Bourdieu with a different meaning?\"\n3. \"The section covers broader issues than just scholasticism, like Carnapian confirmation\"\n4. \"The parallel structure of the three dimensions of judgment would be disrupted\"\n5. \"The title should indicate this is about AI's relationship to reality, which 'correspondence with reality' does clearly\"\n\nResponse to objections:\n1. The medieval scholastic parallel provides a uniquely apt historical precedent for the issues we're describing\n2. We can address the Bourdieu connection briefly to distinguish our usage\n3. We could use a title that combines elements: \"The Scholastic Fallacy: AI's Tenuous Correspondence with Reality\"\n4. We could maintain parallel structure by renaming all three subsections to focus on specific fallacies\n5. We can ensure the introduction to the section clearly establishes the connection to reality\n\nConsidering these points, I think renaming has merit but requires careful handling. A compromise might be \"Scholastic Confirmation: The Absence of Correspondence with Reality\" to maintain the connection to both concepts.",

Do I need a quote?\n\n\nFor scholasticism:\n> By the labors of\nBernold of Constance and others this research issued in a methodi-\ncal procedure: statement of pros and cons, reaching conclusion,\ndefence of conclusion against objection ... That is, authorities pro\nand con were given on one hundred and fifty questions in the-\nology, while the conclusion was left for the reader to reach on\nthe basis of carefully stated rules. \\parencite[211]{longwell_significance_1928}\n\n> nt. The felt result is that of dis-\ncovering truth in particular reality as secure as the universality\nfrom which the search makes its start. The subsequent rests al-\nways upon the prior; and, as the work progresses, no detail is\nomitted in a most meticulous tracing of ramifications, while refer-\nences to preceding proof multiply much as in mathematical demon-\nstration. It is intended, of course, that the admission of each suc-\nceeding stage shall permit no recourse in the issue. So the move-\nment of thought suggests the irrevocable necessity of a machine \np 212\n\n> For the modern\nreader has only to select carefully the underlying assumptions, and\nconsciously accept them, to be swept along irresistibly from one\nstage to the next until an end is reached as sure and indubitable\nas was the beginnin\n212-213\n\nI think this latter is perfect. Because the underlying assumptions for the AI is the user's prompt plus anything in the context plus any vibes from the background training and RLHF of the model. But, rather than having a cold and imposing evidence of logic, we have search_with_bing. \n\n\nSufficient, or should I elaborate more?",

LLMs, constrained to textual domains, fundamentally lack these capabilities.\n\nCurrent AI systems demonstrate what we term a \"discount Carnapian confirmation\" approach to knowledge acquisition. Carnap proposed that \"instead of verification, we may speak of gradually increasing *confirmation* of the law\" (Carnap, 1936, p. 425) through accumulating observations. LLMs mimic this process by gathering textual evidence, but in a fundamentally flawed manner. While Carnap required rigorous empirical observations, LLMs accept formatted text as sufficient evidence, often requiring merely a single authoritative-looking source to confirm a claim.\n\nThis approach was evident in our examination of a ChatGPT Deep Research session focused on the global state of Digital Humanities. When prompted to analyze current trends, the model uncritically accepted a 2019 website claim that the University of Adelaide offered a robust Digital Humanities program. It then proceeded to cite this outdated information as evidence of a growing trend: \"Prior to 2020, only a few DH degrees existed; by 2025, numerous universities offer undergraduate minors, BAs, MAs, and graduate certificates in DH.\" Without verifying whether the program remained active (it did not), the model constructed an entire narrative about disciplinary expansion based on a single outdated webpage.\n\nThis pattern exemplifies the scholastic fallacy inherent in LLM operations. Medieval scholasticism privileged textual authority over empirical investigation, where \"authorities pro and con were given on one hundred and fifty questions in theology, while the conclusion was left for the reader to reach on the basis of carefully stated rules\" (Longwell, 1928, p. 211). Similarly, LLMs privilege content presenting markers of authenticity rather than verifiable facts. Just as scholastic methods involved meticulous reasoning where \"the subsequent rests always upon the prior... while references to preceding proof multiply\" (Longwell, 1928, p. 212), LLMs build elaborate chains of reasoning disconnected from empirical verification.\n\nWhat specifically prevents LLMs from corresponding with reality? Our analysis identifies four critical historiographical assessment capabilities absent in these systems:\n\n1. Inability to distinguish claims from trends. LLMs accept individual institutional statements as representative of broader patterns without sufficient evidence.\n\n2. Failure to consider authorship and temporality. The model does not evaluate when content was created, by whom, or for what purpose, treating all text as equally current and valid regardless of date or source motivation.\n\n3. Cannot relate claims to experiential knowledge. Without engagement with the physical world, LLMs cannot compare textual assertions against known realities.\n\n4. Default position of acceptance rather than skepticism. Unlike human researchers who approach claims critically, LLMs begin from a position of trust, especially for well-formatted content from apparently authoritative domains.\n\nThese deficiencies stem from structural limitations in how LLMs process information. They demonstrate poor performance at \"model-of-mind-of-mind\" tasks, making them unable to hold contradictory information simultaneously. All formatted input is treated as trusted, with no capacity for independent verification.\n\nThe implications for research are profound. As Frankfurt notes in his analysis of \"bullshit\" as indifference to truth (Frankfurt, 2005), the problem is not merely producing falsehoods but lacking concern for whether statements correspond to reality. When confronted with contradictory authorities, human researchers design experiments or seek additional evidence. LLMs never say \"I can't know\" or \"let's verify empirically.\" Instead, they continue producing plausible-sounding text regardless of its correspondence with reality.\n\nThis limitation is not merely technical but represents a fundamental epistemological barrier to LLMs functioning as independent research agents. They operate within what Longwell describes as scholastic reasoning, where \"the modern reader has only to select carefully the underlying assumptions, and consciously accept them, to be swept along irresistibly from one stage to the next until an end is reached as sure and indubitable as was the beginning\" (Longwell, 1928, pp. 212-213). For LLMs, these underlying assumptions comprise the user's prompt, context window content, and statistical patterns from training data. Rather than employing rigorous logic, however, they simply execute `search_with_bing` and accept whatever formatted text they encounter.\n\nThis fundamental disconnection from reality ensures that even as LLMs improve in fluency and factual recall, they remain incapable of the judgment necessary for genuine research insight. Without correspondence to reality, they cannot recognize when claims require verification, when sources might be outdated or biased, or when textual evidence is insufficient to support conclusions.\n\nLet me revise this draft to further match Brian's register and make any necessary improvements:\n\n1.

LLMs infer signs without reference to their referents, producing statistically likely token sequences rather than statements grounded in real-world evidence. This disconnection from reality manifests most clearly in research tasks, where evaluation of claims against empirical evidence constitutes an essential component of scholarly judgment.\n\nWe define correspondence with reality in the context of scholarly research as the specific and intentional regard for the world that words represent. This is not textual consistency, which refers to internal coherence of presented facts within an argument. It is also not merely \"truthiness,\" the feeling that something sounds correct. Rather, it represents an anti-bullshit requirement in the Frankfurt sense \\parencite{frankfurt_bullshit_2005}, where bullshit is characterized not primarily as falsehood but as indifference to truth. Correspondence with reality demands a non-indifference to truth, requiring that there exists an intention that statements could be true and verified against the real world.\n\nCurrent AI systems demonstrate what we term a \"discount Carnapian confirmation\" approach to knowledge acquisition. Carnap proposed that \"instead of verification, we may speak of gradually increasing *confirmation* of the law\" \\parencite[425]{carnap_testability_1936} through accumulating observations.

Medieval scholasticism privileged textual authority over empirical investigation, where \"authorities pro and con were given on one hundred and fifty questions in theology, while the conclusion was left for the reader to reach on the basis of carefully stated rules\" \\parencite[211]{longwell_significance_1928}. Similarly, LLMs privilege content presenting markers of authenticity rather than verifiable facts. The appearance of authority, particularly well-formatted content from domains with educational or institutional extensions, receives unwarranted credibility. Just as scholastic methods involved meticulous reasoning where \"the subsequent rests always upon the prior... while references to preceding proof multiply much as in mathematical demonstration\" \\parencite[212]{longwell_significance_1928}, LLMs build elaborate chains of reasoning disconnected from empirical verification.\n\nWhat specifically prevents LLMs from corresponding with reality? Our analysis identifies four critical historiographical assessment capabilities absent in these systems:\n\nFirst, they exhibit an inability to distinguish claims from trends. LLMs accept individual institutional statements as representative of broader patterns without sufficient evidence. A single university webpage becomes evidence of a \"growing trend\" across higher education globally.\n\nSecond, they fail to consider authorship and temporality. The model does not evaluate when content was created, by whom, or for what purpose, treating all text as equally current and valid regardless of date or source motivation. This leads to treating marketing copy from 2019 as evidence for claims about 2025.\n\nThird, they cannot relate claims to experiential knowledge. Without engagement with the physical world, LLMs cannot compare textual assertions against known realities. Human researchers would notice that a quiescent program contradicts claims of growth.\n\nFourth, they adopt a default position of acceptance rather than skepticism. Unlike human researchers who approach claims critically, LLMs begin from a position of trust, especially for well-formatted content from apparently authoritative domains.\n\nThese deficiencies stem from structural limitations in how LLMs process information. In our testing, we have observed poor performance at what we term \"model-of-mind-of-mind\" tasks. LLMs struggle to hold contradictions within the context window, similar to their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks. This uncriticality of input means that formatted text is trusted so long as it has the appropriate medium in McLuhan's sense. The model's tendency to treat text as authoritative based on its appearance rather than its substance represents a fundamental epistemological flaw.\n\nThe implications for research are profound. When confronted with contradictory authorities, human researchers typically design experiments or seek additional evidence. As one of our transcripts notes: \"It is when we are engaged in something that we are uncertain on, or more to the point, when we judge that our knowledge of the thing is insufficient to epistemically differentiate between possible realities, we run experiments.\" LLMs never say \"I can't know\" or \"let's verify empirically.\" They continue producing plausible-sounding text regardless of its correspondence with reality.\n\nThis limitation represents a fundamental epistemological barrier to LLMs functioning as independent research agents. They operate within what Longwell describes as scholastic reasoning, where \"the modern reader has only to select carefully the underlying assumptions, and consciously accept them, to be swept along irresistibly from one stage to the next until an end is reached as sure and indubitable as was the beginning\" \\parencite[212-213]{longwell_significance_1928}. For LLMs, these underlying assumptions comprise the user's prompt, context window content, and statistical patterns from training data. Rather than employing rigorous logic, however, they simply execute `search_with_bing` or similar functions and accept whatever formatted text they encounter.\n\nThis fundamental disconnection from reality ensures that even as LLMs improve in fluency and factual recall, they remain incapable of the judgment necessary for genuine research insight. Without correspondence to reality, they cannot recognize when claims require verification, when sources might be outdated or biased, or when textual evidence is insufficient to support conclusions. The AI will never look at its words and think, \"These aren't good. Let me throw them out instead of giving them to the user.\" It exemplifies what we term an \"Aristotelian fallacy,\" where the world does not matter; text matters.",

LLMs infer signs without reference to their referents, producing statistically likely token sequences rather than statements grounded in real-world evidence. This disconnection from reality manifests most clearly in research tasks, where the evaluation of claims against empirical evidence constitutes an essential component of scholarly judgement.\n\nWe define correspondence with reality in the context of scholarly research as the specific and intentional regard for the world that words represent. This is not textual consistency, which refers to the internal coherence of presented facts within an argument. It is also not merely \"truthiness,\" the feeling that something sounds correct. Rather, it represents an anti-bullshit requirement in the Frankfurt and Hicks sense \\parencite{frankfurt_bullshit_2005, hicks_chatgpt_2024}, where bullshit is characterised not primarily as falsehood but as indifference to truth. Correspondence with reality demands a non-indifference to truth, requiring that there exists an intention that statements could be true and that claims should be confirmed, tested, or falsified against the real world.\n\nCurrent AI systems demonstrate what we term a \"discount Carnapian confirmation\" approach to knowledge acquisition. Carnap proposed that \"instead of verification, we may speak of gradually increasing confirmation of the law\" \\parencite[425]{carnap_testability_1936} through accumulating observations. LLMs mimic this process by gathering textual evidence, but in a fundamentally flawed manner. While Carnap required rigorous empirical observations\\footnote{For this paper, we will set aside the significant philosophy of science debates around the demarcation problem, here. There is no Philosophy of Science position on \"fact\" that the actions of an LLM corresponds with save, perhaps that of Feyerabend.}, LLMs accept formatted text as sufficient evidence, often requiring merely a single authoritative-sounding source to confirm a claim.\n\n% TODO Shawn, you've been doing this for research onto this paper. Maybe you have better evidence for below?\n\nThis approach was evident in our examination of a ChatGPT Deep Research session focused on analysing the global state of Digital Humanities\\footnote{https://chatgpt.com/share/67d6a0c5-7648-8004-b620-70d91fdb7239}. When prompted to analyse current trends, the model uncritically accepted a 2019 website claim that the University of Adelaide offered a robust Digital Humanities program. It then proceeded to cite this outdated information as evidence of a growing trend: \"Prior to 2020, only a few DH degrees existed; by 2025, numerous universities offer undergraduate minors, BAs, MAs, and graduate certificates in DH.\" (ChatGPT Deep Research run 11 March 2025, model unclear) Without verifying whether the program remained active or successful (it was not), the model constructed an entire narrative about disciplinary expansion based on a single outdated webpage.\n\nThis uncritical approach exemplifies the scholastic fallacy inherent in LLM operations. Medieval scholasticism privileged textual authority over empirical investigation, where:\n\\begin{quote}\nThat is, authorities pro and con were given on one hundred and fifty questions in the-\nology, while the conclusion was left for the reader to reach on the basis of carefully stated rules. ...  The felt result is that of discovering truth in particular reality as secure as the universality from which the search makes its start. The subsequent rests always upon the prior; and, as the work progresses, no detail is omitted in a most meticulous tracing of ramifications, while references to preceding proof multiply much as in mathematical demonstration. It is intended, of course, that the admission of each succeeding stage shall permit no recourse in the issue. So the movement of thought suggests the irrevocable necessity of a machine. \\parencite[211-212]{longwell_significance_1928}\n\\end{quote}\nSimilarly, LLMs privilege content presenting markers of authenticity rather than verifiable facts. The appearance of authority, particularly well-formatted content from domains with educational or institutional extensions, receives unwarranted credibility. By collecting citations to websites like stamps and finding evidence which already confirms their worldviews, LLMs build elaborate chains of reasoning disconnected from empirical verification. These chains are not meticulous nor do they claim no details-ommitted; rather, the first plausible source is taken to stand in for the whole, and the LLMs chain of authority is built one search result at a time.\n\nWhat specifically prevents LLMs from corresponding with reality? Our analysis identifies four critical historiographical assessment capabilities absent in these systems:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item They exhibit an inability to distinguish claims from trends. LLMs accept individual institutional statements as representative of broader patterns without sufficient evidence. A single university webpage becomes evidence of a \"growing trend\" across higher education globally.\n    \\item They fail to consider authorship and temporality. The model does not evaluate when content was created, by whom, or for what purpose, treating all text as equally current and valid regardless of date or source motivation. This leads to treating marketing copy from 2019 as evidence for claims about 2025.\n    \\item They cannot relate claims to tacit, social, or experiential knowledge. Without engagement with the physical world, LLMs cannot compare textual assertions against known realities. Human researchers would notice that a quiescent program contradicts claims of growth.\n    \\item They adopt a default position of acceptance rather than skepticism. Unlike human researchers who approach claims critically, LLMs begin from a position of trust, especially for well-formatted content from apparently authoritative domains.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThese deficiencies stem from structural limitations in how LLMs process information. In our testing, we have observed poor performance at what we term \"model-of-mind-of-mind\" tasks\\footnote{One of Ballsun-Stantons model evaluations involves getting specific models to play social deduction games against each other. Models tested to date are very bad at both maintaining a false reality to others and slightly less bad at detecting that false reality. These evals do not test if the models can \\textit{role-play} deception, in a moustache-twirling villain sense. They test if they can hold a model of the world within their context window and persuade others to a \\textit{contradictory} model.}. LLMs struggle to hold contradictions within the context window, similar to their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks\\parencite[see][]{willison_prompt_2023}. This uncriticality of input means that formatted text is trusted so long as it has the appropriate medium in McLuhan's sense. The model's tendency to treat text as authoritative based on its appearance rather than its substance and relationship to other texts represents a fundamental epistemological flaw.\n\n% REDO this paragraph without the quote.\nWhen confronted with contradictory authorities, human researchers typically design experiments or seek additional evidence. As one of our transcripts notes: \"It is when we are engaged in something that we are uncertain on, or more to the point, when we judge that our knowledge of the thing is insufficient to epistemically differentiate between possible realities, we run experiments.\" LLMs never say \"I can't know\" or \"let's verify empirically.\" They continue producing plausible-sounding text regardless of its correspondence with reality.\n\nThis limitation represents a fundamental epistemological barrier to LLMs functioning as independent research agents.

      "text": "\nLet me search through the transcript.tex file for relevant quotes about literature reviews and their persuasive nature. I'll focus on the Section 2.3 questions and other relevant sections.\n\nLooking at the transcript under \"Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 1\":\n\n```\n2.3 question one.\nExplicitly outline your understanding of a literature review as a persuasive rather than descriptive task. Could you unpack this difference in more detail?\nOh my god.\nOkay. A literature review fundamentally does two things. One, fundamentally, it situates whatever we're writing within the context of the literature.\nRight? So,\nliterature says this is the jargon, here's the research that came before and so on and so forth.\nYou would think that that would be descriptive. That is false. It's informative, but the literature review\nfor purposes of any research task is fundamentally persuasive. Because it is the evidence that warrants the claim of and therefore this paper makes the following claims.\nRight? It is not it is not descriptive in its own guise. Its utility is not It's not an annotated bibliography.\nMoreover, the literature review, besides situating the research in a broader context, introducing whatever frame you want, how how how you're approaching the problem, has to do two things. One, why has no one else or sorry, to demonstrate that no one else has solved this problem.\nThis is an inductive step. Right? This is to say here is all the surrounding literature of the problem, but what I am about to write is novel, pay attention. Now, to be clear, all these purposes are not simply meant for academic discourse.\nBut when you talk about research for purposes of business, the literature review has an even more pointed persuasive task. It is to offer evidence in support or against some claim.\nAnd so therefore, being able to evaluate and situate the evidence in relation to the claim is essential.\nBut even\nSo it's informational, right? It is situational.\nBut the informative nature serves a broader purpose. And it is to serve as evidence for some argument.\nA literature review is not a search.\nAnd now, take it back. So,\nFundamentally, a literature review must make the case of why does this evident evidence support this claim? Why should we, the reader, care?\nUm even when it's delivering the evidence, even when the point of it is purely to situate and deliver evidence, there is that persuasive line that must go beyond simple summarization. Cool.\n```\n\nAnd from \"Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 2\":\n\n```\n2.3 question two. How exactly does judgment function in the act of selecting and organizing literature to establish scholarly novelty?\nFundamentally, this is the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, right?\nUm.\nBasically by\nby describing\nThis is where situating ourselves in literature is so important because if we say where we are, then that is evidence that we have done the necessary work around where we are to say that no one else has had this position. And so we prove novelty by providing context. The trick is this is a persuasive game as per my prior um discussions. This is a persuasive game\nwhere if we use the right language, if we show an awareness of recent publications, if we show an awareness of the web of scholarship that supports If if we so shown awareness of the web of scholarship that supports the people that we are citing, then then we can say within this literature, within this discipline, no one else is talking about. It means that there is assurance in jargon in Shibboleths in context. And because we have evidence that we have situated ourselves in a particular position, then people are aware of the literature in the discipline can accept our claim for novelty.\nNow, where does judgment come in? Honestly, this is more model of mind of mine, but judgment is is part of it. Because what we're talking about is what do what in our opinion, judgment, will our peers find persuasive? Because the thing is is that we can dress up a bad literature review in exactly the same language as we dress up a good literature review. The quality of the language, the quality of the framing would be about the same. But absent judgment, the literature review will be deficient.\n```\n\nAnd from \"Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 3\":\n\n```\nUh, 2.3, question three. Describe the intellectual act involved in situating a research problem within scholarly traditions. Why can't AI perform this act currently? Patience really. Um.\nThis is this isn't a failure of model. Um this is a failure of programming. So,\nliterally all that's required of this is having a to-do list. Um having your tasks and and iterating through your tasks and being systematic with it. Um.\nThis is actually the easiest of all the questions where it is step one, make sure you're using the right words, which is mostly difficult when the user's request isn't using the right words. So it is figuring out what disciplines speak to the user's request, and let's be clear, this this applies beyond the academic as well. So,\nthe user says something and the AI needs to figure out what disciplines, academic or technical or even shopping, can answer it, operationalize it, and then read the literature. Um.\nSo this the the read the literature part is the hard part. Um. Because effectively, this is going well, what papers? You know, it's first search and so here search is a problem because we don't have good access to books or journals. Um, Semantic Scholar does not count. Um.\nBut it then needs to go, 'Cool, these these things are speaking to my disciplines, these things are speaking to my topic'. What are the direct reference? What are the indirect reference? And it just needs to follow the scholarly graph. Um. There is an element of judgment here in the question operationalization, but we've covered that before. Um. A lot of this is social and programming problems. So, when it's following the literature, um if it doesn't have access to a paper, it needs to prompt the user to get access to the paper. When it's following literature, it needs to be systematic in following the literature. It can't just go, 'Oh well, I've collected enough evidence'. That can happen afterwards. Like, our our issue here\nis not that it isn't capable of this.\nOkay, where I got off.\nUm So fundamentally this is to do this. What's the question? Situate. Honestly, it is go build an annotated bibliography. The the place where I am not confident\nis if it can discard sources.\nRight? Effectively it is go search, find papers, ask the user for papers that it doesn't have access to, involve the user in the research effectively. Um, all the other discussion that I've had around being involved in an argument for this. Uh. And fan out in the literature, look at the citations, build an annotated bibliography. Honestly building a .bib file would probably be the best way to do this. Um pulling out quotes that it can paraphrase, but being systematic about it. So, so it needs to to to\nI mean look, this is going to be bouncing back and forth between my own thoughts. But effectively, it is it needs to be able to demonstrate to the user that what field their question belongs in, like discipline question, who in that field is talking about it, who their antecedents were, and the citations out until at least the second generation, probably the third. It needs to read all of them, needs to build an annotated bibliography, and then have quotes about the annotated bibliography. So just needs patience really, and that's a matter of programming and and that's the hard bit. But, we we've covered that.\n```\n\nFrom these sections, I can pull out several key quotes about the persuasive nature of literature reviews and the role of judgment in research work. The main points include:\n\n1. Literature reviews are fundamentally persuasive, not descriptive\n2. They serve to establish novelty through context and situating the work\n3. They need to demonstrate why the reader should care\n4. They require judgment about what peers will find persuasive\n5. The process of situating research requires systematic work through the scholarly graph\n\nThese quotes cover the major aspects you've discussed regarding literature reviews as persuasive documents and the role of judgment in research work.\n\nHere are the key quotes from your recordings about literature reviews and their persuasive nature:\n\nFrom Section 2.3 Question 1:\n> \"A literature review fundamentally does two things.

          "thinking": "\nLet me search through the transcript.tex file for relevant quotes about literature reviews and their persuasive nature. I'll focus on the Section 2.3 questions and other relevant sections.\n\nLooking at the transcript under \"Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 1\":\n\n```\n2.3 question one.\nExplicitly outline your understanding of a literature review as a persuasive rather than descriptive task. Could you unpack this difference in more detail?\nOh my god.\nOkay. A literature review fundamentally does two things. One, fundamentally, it situates whatever we're writing within the context of the literature.\nRight? So,\nliterature says this is the jargon, here's the research that came before and so on and so forth.\nYou would think that that would be descriptive. That is false. It's informative, but the literature review\nfor purposes of any research task is fundamentally persuasive. Because it is the evidence that warrants the claim of and therefore this paper makes the following claims.\nRight? It is not it is not descriptive in its own guise. Its utility is not It's not an annotated bibliography.\nMoreover, the literature review, besides situating the research in a broader context, introducing whatever frame you want, how how how you're approaching the problem, has to do two things. One, why has no one else or sorry, to demonstrate that no one else has solved this problem.\nThis is an inductive step. Right? This is to say here is all the surrounding literature of the problem, but what I am about to write is novel, pay attention. Now, to be clear, all these purposes are not simply meant for academic discourse.\nBut when you talk about research for purposes of business, the literature review has an even more pointed persuasive task. It is to offer evidence in support or against some claim.\nAnd so therefore, being able to evaluate and situate the evidence in relation to the claim is essential.\nBut even\nSo it's informational, right? It is situational.\nBut the informative nature serves a broader purpose. And it is to serve as evidence for some argument.\nA literature review is not a search.\nAnd now, take it back. So,\nFundamentally, a literature review must make the case of why does this evident evidence support this claim? Why should we, the reader, care?\nUm even when it's delivering the evidence, even when the point of it is purely to situate and deliver evidence, there is that persuasive line that must go beyond simple summarization. Cool.\n```\n\nAnd from \"Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 2\":\n\n```\n2.3 question two. How exactly does judgment function in the act of selecting and organizing literature to establish scholarly novelty?\nFundamentally, this is the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, right?\nUm.\nBasically by\nby describing\nThis is where situating ourselves in literature is so important because if we say where we are, then that is evidence that we have done the necessary work around where we are to say that no one else has had this position. And so we prove novelty by providing context. The trick is this is a persuasive game as per my prior um discussions. This is a persuasive game\nwhere if we use the right language, if we show an awareness of recent publications, if we show an awareness of the web of scholarship that supports If if we so shown awareness of the web of scholarship that supports the people that we are citing, then then we can say within this literature, within this discipline, no one else is talking about. It means that there is assurance in jargon in Shibboleths in context. And because we have evidence that we have situated ourselves in a particular position, then people are aware of the literature in the discipline can accept our claim for novelty.\nNow, where does judgment come in? Honestly, this is more model of mind of mine, but judgment is is part of it. Because what we're talking about is what do what in our opinion, judgment, will our peers find persuasive? Because the thing is is that we can dress up a bad literature review in exactly the same language as we dress up a good literature review. The quality of the language, the quality of the framing would be about the same. But absent judgment, the literature review will be deficient.\n```\n\nAnd from \"Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 3\":\n\n```\nUh, 2.3, question three. Describe the intellectual act involved in situating a research problem within scholarly traditions. Why can't AI perform this act currently? Patience really. Um.\nThis is this isn't a failure of model. Um this is a failure of programming. So,\nliterally all that's required of this is having a to-do list. Um having your tasks and and iterating through your tasks and being systematic with it. Um.\nThis is actually the easiest of all the questions where it is step one, make sure you're using the right words, which is mostly difficult when the user's request isn't using the right words. So it is figuring out what disciplines speak to the user's request, and let's be clear, this this applies beyond the academic as well. So,\nthe user says something and the AI needs to figure out what disciplines, academic or technical or even shopping, can answer it, operationalize it, and then read the literature. Um.\nSo this the the read the literature part is the hard part. Um. Because effectively, this is going well, what papers? You know, it's first search and so here search is a problem because we don't have good access to books or journals. Um, Semantic Scholar does not count. Um.\nBut it then needs to go, 'Cool, these these things are speaking to my disciplines, these things are speaking to my topic'. What are the direct reference? What are the indirect reference? And it just needs to follow the scholarly graph. Um. There is an element of judgment here in the question operationalization, but we've covered that before. Um. A lot of this is social and programming problems. So, when it's following the literature, um if it doesn't have access to a paper, it needs to prompt the user to get access to the paper. When it's following literature, it needs to be systematic in following the literature. It can't just go, 'Oh well, I've collected enough evidence'. That can happen afterwards. Like, our our issue here\nis not that it isn't capable of this.\nOkay, where I got off.\nUm So fundamentally this is to do this. What's the question? Situate. Honestly, it is go build an annotated bibliography. The the place where I am not confident\nis if it can discard sources.\nRight? Effectively it is go search, find papers, ask the user for papers that it doesn't have access to, involve the user in the research effectively. Um, all the other discussion that I've had around being involved in an argument for this. Uh. And fan out in the literature, look at the citations, build an annotated bibliography. Honestly building a .bib file would probably be the best way to do this. Um pulling out quotes that it can paraphrase, but being systematic about it. So, so it needs to to to\nI mean look, this is going to be bouncing back and forth between my own thoughts. But effectively, it is it needs to be able to demonstrate to the user that what field their question belongs in, like discipline question, who in that field is talking about it, who their antecedents were, and the citations out until at least the second generation, probably the third. It needs to read all of them, needs to build an annotated bibliography, and then have quotes about the annotated bibliography. So just needs patience really, and that's a matter of programming and and that's the hard bit. But, we we've covered that.\n```\n\nFrom these sections, I can pull out several key quotes about the persuasive nature of literature reviews and the role of judgment in research work. The main points include:\n\n1. Literature reviews are fundamentally persuasive, not descriptive\n2. They serve to establish novelty through context and situating the work\n3. They need to demonstrate why the reader should care\n4. They require judgment about what peers will find persuasive\n5. The process of situating research requires systematic work through the scholarly graph\n\nThese quotes cover the major aspects you've discussed regarding literature reviews as persuasive documents and the role of judgment in research work.",

what hasn't been answered or needs reconsideration.\n- Warrant: This identification process requires abductive reasoning and understanding of disciplinary zeitgeist.\n- Evidence: AI's inability to identify \"interesting\" gaps due to its fundamental limitation of only predicting within its training distribution.\n\nParagraph 5: Model-of-Mind and Audience Awareness\n- Claim: Effective research requires understanding what questions are salient to the discipline and audience.\n- Warrant: This requires model-of-mind capabilities to anticipate how work will be received.\n- Evidence: AI's inability to differentiate between genuinely persuasive evidence for a scholarly audience versus pattern-matched content.\n\nParagraph 6: The Problem of Temporality\n- Claim: Research requires understanding the historical development and current state of a field.\n- Warrant: AI systems struggle with temporality and flatten historical development.\n- Evidence: AI's inability to distinguish between outdated claims and current scholarship, treating all texts as equally relevant regardless of publication date.\n\nParagraph 7: Connection to Technoscholasticism\n- Claim: AI's approach to research exemplifies technoscholasticism - taking texts at face value without critical engagement.\n- Warrant: Without the ability to push back against claims or experience surprise at unexpected findings, AI cannot participate in genuine research.\n- Evidence: AI's tendency to treat all well-formatted academic text as equally authoritative, with no capability for Peircean surprise or contradiction between expectation and reality.\n\nParagraph 8: Conclusion - Implications for AI in Research\n- Claim: AI systems can be useful tools for information gathering but cannot independently perform genuine research.\n- Warrant: The judgment-intensive nature of research work requires human oversight and direction.\n- Evidence: Summary of the judgment deficiencies (no discernment, no sense of gaps, no awareness of audience, no temporal understanding) that prevent AI from being more than a tool.\n\n# Nature of Research Work Subsection Outline\n\n## Paragraph 1: Introduction - Research as Persuasion\n- **Claim**: Research work, particularly literature reviews, is fundamentally persuasive rather than merely descriptive or informative.\n- **Warrant**: This persuasive nature explains why AI's approach to research fundamentally misses the point.\n- **Evidence**: Marketing terminology of \"Deep Research\" products that frame AI as capable of genuine research.\n\n## Paragraph 2: Dual Purpose of Literature Reviews\n- **Claim**: Literature reviews serve two essential persuasive functions: situating work within disciplinary context and establishing novelty/importance.\n- **Warrant**: These functions require normative judgments about disciplinary boundaries and research value.\n- **Evidence**: Your transcript statements on literature reviews answering \"Why should we care?\" and demonstrating novelty.\n\n## Paragraph 3: Judgment in Source Selection\n- **Claim**: Effective research requires discernment in selecting which sources to engage with or exclude.\n- **Warrant**: Selection is an intellectual act requiring evaluation of authority and persuasive value.\n- **Evidence**: Example of AI citing library blog posts when asked for \"good scholars,\" demonstrating pattern matching without discernment.\n\n## Paragraph 4: Identifying Knowledge Gaps\n- **Claim**: Research requires identifying meaningful gaps in existing knowledge.\n- **Warrant**: Finding gaps requires abductive reasoning that AI structurally lacks.\n- **Evidence**: AI's limitation to predicting within its training distribution versus human ability to notice unexplored areas.\n\n## Paragraph 5: The Flattening Problem\n- **Claim**: AI exhibits \"flattening\" of the literature, treating all sources with equal weight.\n- **Warrant**: This flattening stems from training on text without experiential grounding.\n- **Evidence**: No sense of \"why is this here?\" or \"why is this, by this person, here?\" in AI-generated literature reviews.\n\n## Paragraph 6: Connection to Technoscholasticism\n- **Claim**: AI's approach to research exemplifies technoscholasticism.\n- **Warrant**: Taking texts at face value without pushing back represents the core issue.\n- **Evidence**: AI's inability to experience Peircean surprise or contradiction between expectation and reality.\n\n## Paragraph 7: Conclusion - Implications\n- **Claim**: AI systems remain tools that require human judgment for genuine research.\n- **Warrant**: The threefold judgment required (model-of-mind, finding negative space, questions of utility) cannot be replicated by statistical models.\n- **Evidence**: Summary of discernment failures that prevent independent AI research capability.",

Key points:\n\n1. Defined correspondence with reality as \"specific and intentional regard for the world that words represent\"\n2. Introduced \"discount Carnapian confirmation\" concept to describe how LLMs accumulate textual evidence without evaluation\n3. Used Digital Humanities example as concrete evidence of uncritical acceptance of outdated claims\n4. Connected to scholasticism with Longwell quotes\n5.

Established structural limitations in LLM information processing\n7. Concluded with the \"Scholastic fallacy\" concept\n\n### Key Sources Used:\n- Carnap (1936) on confirmation approach\n- Frankfurt (2005) and Hicks (2024) on \"bullshit\" as indifference to truth\n- Longwell (1928) on scholastic reasoning\n- Ballsun-Stanton (2024) \"Is the 'Calculator for Words' analogy useful for communicating about LLMs?\"\n- Willison (2023) on prompt injection attacks\n\n## Current Work: Section 2.3 Nature of Research Work\n\nWe're developing the structure for this section, focusing on why research (particularly literature reviews) requires judgment that AI fundamentally lacks. Our current revised outline:\n\n### Paragraph 1: Introduction - Research Writing and Literature Reviews\n- **Claim**: Research writing, particularly literature reviews, serves both informative and persuasive functions.\n- **Warrant**: Understanding these dual functions reveals why AI approaches to research are fundamentally limited.\n- **Supporting Literature Needed**: Academic sources on rhetoric of science/scholarly writing\n\n### Paragraph 2: Beyond Information: The Persuasive Function\n- **Claim**: Literature reviews establish that: (1) the research is situated within a discipline and (2) the question has not been adequately answered.\n- **Warrant**: These persuasive elements require normative judgments about relevance and novelty.\n- **Supporting Literature Needed**: Studies on rhetorical structure of literature reviews\n\n### Paragraph 3: Source Selection as Intellectual Act\n- **Claim**: Effective research requires discernment in source selection that goes beyond pattern matching.\n- **Warrant**: Selection involves evaluating not just content but authority, context, and persuasive value within disciplinary conversations.\n- **Supporting Literature Needed**: Work on scholarly judgment in source evaluation\n\n### Paragraph 4: Abductive Reasoning and Gap Identification\n- **Claim**: Research requires identifying meaningful gaps through abductive reasoning.\n- **Warrant**: This connects directly to the inductive reasoning deficiency discussed in section 2.2.2.\n- **Supporting Literature Needed**: Explicit connection to Peirce's work on abduction cited earlier\n\n### Paragraph 5: The Problem of Context Flattening\n- **Claim**: AI exhibits \"flattening\" of literature, treating all sources with similar textual features as equivalent.\n- **Warrant**: This stems from training on text without human experience of disciplinary context.\n- **Supporting Literature Needed**: Work on disciplinary knowledge construction\n\n### Paragraph 6: Connection to Technoscholasticism\n- **Claim**: AI's approach to research exemplifies technoscholasticism - privileging well-formatted text without critical engagement.\n- **Warrant**: This directly connects to correspondence with reality deficit discussed in 2.2.3.\n- **Supporting Literature Needed**: Research on critical reading practices in scholarship\n\n### Paragraph 7: Conclusion - Research as Human Judgment\n- **Claim**: AI systems remain tools requiring human judgment for genuine research.\n- **Warrant**: The essential judgment functions cannot be replicated by statistical models.\n- **Supporting Literature Needed**: Philosophy of science on research as a human activity\n\n## Key Insights for Section 2.3\n\nFrom our discussion of literature reviews and research, we've established that:\n\n1. Literature reviews have a fundamentally persuasive element: \"This is a problem worth solving, and my research plausibly can solve it.\"\n\n2. The judgment required for research is threefold:\n   - Model-of-mind: is what we are discussing relevant within the domains of the audience?\n   - Finding the negative space: is this a genuine insight?\n   - Questions of utility: is this a useful insight?\n\n3. AI systems demonstrate critical shortcomings in research:\n   - No sense of selection, about why certain items were chosen\n   - No sense of academic judgment about appropriate papers to cite\n   - Lack of discernment about source quality and relevance\n   - Taking literature at face value without pushing back (technoscholasticism)\n   - Cannot identify genuinely novel gaps or valuable insights\n\n4. Example of AI's research limitation: when prompted for \"peer reviewed sources from good scholars,\" it included library blog posts, showing pattern matching without discernment.\n\n5. The connection to technoscholasticism: AI takes literature at face value without experiencing Peirce's \"surprise\" or contradiction between expectation and reality.\n\n6. We need to explicitly connect the discussion of abductive reasoning from section 2.2.2 to the identification of research gaps in this section.\n\n7. We need additional academic literature to support these claims, particularly on:\n   - Rhetoric of science and scholarly writing\n   - Structure and purpose of literature reviews\n   - Source evaluation and scholarly judgment\n   - Disciplinary knowledge construction\n   - Critical reading practices in scholarship\n   - Philosophy of science on research as a human activity\n\nThe next step is to develop this section with appropriate academic sources while maintaining your academic register and style.",
