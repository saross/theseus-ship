It aims to \u2018catalyze groundbreaking, domain-specific research outcomes from humanities scholars through the integral application of AI-inspired tools and techniques\u2019. \n\nBrian Ballsun-Stanton, the project lead, (a) is a philosopher of science and technology, (b) has a strong technology background including an advanced degree in IT, (c) is a groundbreaking researcher in the application of LLMs to humanities research and teaching, (d) has worked for over a decade on software development, data modelling, and reproducibility / research confidence in digital humanities, including archaeology, history, ethnography, and linguistics. In much of this work, especially (d), he has collaborated with Shawn Ross.\n\nShawn Ross, the second applicant, is an archaeologist and historian of SE Europe and Eastern Mediterranean with a specialisation in the development of digital tools and methods. Shawn has let major fieldwork campaigns (including a large-scale, diachronic landscape archaeology project in Bulgaria). He has also led development of field data capture software since 2012 that is still under development and in use. Since 2022 he has also held a secondment to the Australian Research Data Commons, furthering his expertise in persistent identifiers, metadata, vocabularies, and other aspects of FAIR data and research confidence / integrity / reproducibility, which he carries over into his own research and software development. He has collaborated with Brian for over 13 years, and is now working with him on a robust exploration of the use of LLMs to build bibliography and research datasets in a digital humanities / digital archaeology context. As part of his digital archaeology work, he has explored the deployment of digital field recording systems, compared the use of crowdsourcing to automated approaches, and assessed the utility of what would now be considered \u2018traditional\u2019 machine-learning approaches to the extraction of archaeological information from remotely sensed imagery (including an exploration of the adoption of these techniques and a critique of their uncritical use and they hype around them). Importantly, as a professor of history and archaeology at Macquarie University seconded to the ARDC as Manager, National Information Infrastructure Products, I connect the participants at Macquarie with those at the ARDC.\n\nIn our past collaborations, including around the development of field research software, we have emphasised how working across disciplines - e.g., archaeology, ethnography, oral history, and linguistics in the humanities, plus field sciences like ecology and geoscience - improves our understanding of research design as well as digital tools, techniques, and processes.\n\nThe ARDC contribution to the project would include members of the National Coordination unit (including members of the Expertise, Design and Delivery, and Products teams), NeCTAR, and the Humanities, Arts, Social Sciences and Indigenous (HASS&I) Thematics Research Data Commons. These teams have experience with co-design, expertise in AI/ML systems, user-focused product development and delivery, and the implementation of services on a national research cloud, as well as alignment with international best practices in FAIR data, software, and other digital research outputs. Co-development projects at the ARDC generally involve 1:1 co-investment, which is what we request in the budget.\n\nIn this application, we intend to explore both capabilities and constraints across the entire research lifecycle of a typical archaeological or historical research project. \n\nEOI components related to each step of the research lifecycle:\n\nIdeation - iterative exploration of a research topic either for purely inductive research or as the hypothesis-seeking step in abductive research. This step may be iterative, returned to later the hypothesis-seeking phase has been completed to articulate the resulting hypothesis and test criteria to drive the deductive phase of abductive research.  \nArticulation of research design, including clear understanding and statement of the type of research, research question or hypothesis, and avoidance of common failures or weaknesses in research design. This step could include approaches like the generation of a preregistration when appropriate to the discipline.\nBibliographic research, including an exploration of what sort of research is returned by \u2018deep research\u2019 models (what timeframe, what perspectives, how complete), including whether or not such models tend to emphasise \u2018mainstream\u2019 literature or include more idiosyncratic results. \nDataset generation, cleaning, curation, and documentation. Including multimodal data including structured data, text, geospatial data, and multimedia data as used in, e.g., archaeological research (field and artefact photography; remotely sensed imagery, geospatial feature datasets, historical maps, oral interviews, etc.). (How) can LLMs help assemble research datasets and what are the constraints and limitations? How might these be overcome? LLMs have revolutionised code documentation - (how) can they improve the richness, consistency, and coverage of dataset documentation? How can they improve the machine readability / actionability of datasets, so we can move past human-readable FAIR data to machine-readable FAIR data, as per the original FAIR principles and more recent efforts like WorldFAIR. Discussion of LLMs in improving the FAIRness of data has been limited to date, and it has even been proposed that documenting datasets through metadata may no longer be necessary because LLMs mitigate the need for a discovery / explanatory layer - we believe this outcome is unlikely and LLMs should be seen as a tool for improving documentation. We will also look at how legible datasets are to LLMs and feed this understanding back into the documentation of datasets (as an extension of \u2018machine-readability\u2019). Preparation of data for sharing in the mode appropriate to the discipline. \nSoftware creation, especially how combining a Software Carpentries-level understanding of coding plus the use of LLMs to generate code can allow far more researchers to switch from desktop software like spreadsheets to programmatic analysis, or open programmatic analysis to a wider audience (without ignore the pitfalls and dangers of attempting to use LLMs to generate code when the research does not have adequate knowledge and expertise). This point can apply to quantitative analysis like statistics in archaeology, or to computer assisted text or image analysis. Documentation and FAIRification of software. Preparation of data for sharing in the mode appropriate to the discipline. \nAnalysis, such as the development of transparent workflows that can combine data and software to produce analyses that others can understand, replacing irreproducible analyses using (e.g) spreadsheets, GIS tools, or commercial text analysis tools. \nIterative composition / revision of an output based on this analysis, e.g., incorporating iterative prompting to spur along the writing process through the use of a virtual interlocutor, and improve the structure, thinking, and expression of the paper - without ceding control, losing authorial voice, or being routed into conventional or unoriginal thinking.\nIterating across the steps of this project lifecycle as needed.\n\nThe proposed outcome is a pipeline or, more appropriately, a workbench that compliments rather than replaces a human researcher (as opposed to the \u2018virtual scientist\u2019 that has sometimes been proposed) that can leverage LLMs to improve scholarly outputs through facilitated ideation, improved research design, FAIRer data, the use of code rather than GUI-based / mass-market software for analysis, and more efficient writing of higher-quality (in terms of structure, logic, and expression) outputs. These improvements will be realised in both qualitative and quantitative research, whether inductive or abductive. \n\nWe would look to implement the components of a workbench in a redeployable way that would allow us to switch out or choose between various models at each stage. We understand that model capabilities are evolving rapidly and are likely to continue doing so over the next 2-3 years, so emphasis will be on effective and reliable techniques, approaches, and tooling that allows the substitution of models for one another for each component of the workbench.\n\nWe will leverage the ARDC\u2019s experience in co-design and Product-focused delivery of national (and international) services at a high quality to build a multi-component LLM workbench that could be deployed on the ARDC\u2019s NeCTAR service, developed (and subsequently socialised and promoted) in cooperation with the HASS&I Thematic Research Data Commons and their network of researchers. \n\nIn addition, we will develop approaches to making LLM contributions to research more transparent and reusable, such as capturing chain-of-thought and references in \u2018deep research\u2019 / \u2018reasoning\u2019 models and agents in a reliable way that can be documented and shared in accordance with the FAIR principles.\n\nWe will also include a component to build resources to assist researchers, such as a prompt \u2018grimnoire\u2019 and best practices for utilising LLMs in general and with each stage in the research lifecycle / with each component of our workbench.\n\nWe are applying for a \u2018Medium Award\u2019, defined as \u2018Between [USD] $100,001 to $500,000 per year to support research and development that has completed initial phases of planning and is ready to initiate projects that will produce specific, novel outcomes.\u2019\n\nWe have already undertaken exploratory research around bibliographic search, dataset generation, software creation, and composition / revision. \n\nThis project would \u2018[Explore] AI-based approaches that the field sees as risky, but with high impact if successful\u2019. It aligns with the following priority area:\n\n\n\n\nBudget per year:\n\nBrian, 0.4FTE level D academic, each year = AUD$105,000 = USD$67k\n1 x international PhD scholarship for RA (MQRES) = AUD$75,000 = USD$48k\n1 x domestic PhD scholarship for RA (MQRES) = AUD$35,000 = USD$23k\nCo-investment for ARDC = AUD$400,000 = USD$253k\nTotal per year = AUD$615k = USD$391k\n\nAll items last two years except the PhD scholarships which last three years\n\nTimeline:\n\nCo-design / business analysis / requirements gathering / scoping\nTechnical elaboration\nIterative development with feedback from users, including QA during development\nDeployment of a demonstration service\nContinuous improvement through the life of the project implementing a product mindset with a user focus\n\n\n\n"

The\ndigitalisation of teaching and learning formats at universities is\nincreasingly giving rise to so-called intermediate spaces. These spaces\nmust be designed in such a way that they enable flexible, participative\nand barrier-free learning.\n\nThe eTeach annual conference will explore the challenges and potential\nof digital, virtual and hybrid spaces and focus on the interplay between\nspace, technology and didactics. The focus will be on practical examples\nand research approaches that show how digital and analogue learning\nspaces can be combined creatively and in a way that promotes learning.\nThe aim is to design \\\"learning spaces\\\" together with teachers and\nstudents.)\n\nInformation sought:\n\nKeynote: 25 Sept., 1pm\n\n\\- duration: 1 hour (40 min. presentation plus intro- and question time)\n\n# **Topis of interest to the E-Teach Netzwerk team (without a narrow alignment to the topic above):**\n\n*\\*\\*Please indicate which of the following topics align with your\ninterests and plans (i.e. insert what you have sent me where it aligns,\nquick cut-and-paste is okay)*\n\n## - a philosopher's view of LLMS / AI\n\nYes, absolutely. From a trivial point of view,\n<https://denubis.github.io/germany-keynote-ai-policy-briefing/avoiding-sadness#/title-slide>\nand my default workshop <https://osf.io/rd24y/> speak to this. Beyond\nthat, I have a paper: <https://zenodo.org/records/12602858> and more in\nprocess, though most of them are related to the next topic. I have a\npaper I'm getting ready to submit to JDoc and present at IACAP:\n\nAbstract 1:\n\nThis paper introduces the concept of \\\"technoscholasticism\\\" to analyse\nfundamental limitations in AI research tools. Through autoethnographic\ninvestigation of frontier models deployed in February 2025, we\ndemonstrate that these systems, despite claims of \\\"agentic\\\"\ncapabilities, lack three crucial dimensions of judgment: epistemic\nhumility, inductive capacity, and correspondence with reality. Like\nmedieval scholastics, these tools privilege textual authority over\ncritical assessment of knowledge claims, explaining their inability to\ngenerate novel insights despite vast information access. While\nacknowledging and testing the current \\\"mundane utility\\\" of tools like\nDeep Research for specific research tasks, we propose architectural and\nmethodological requirements for more effective research tools that\nacknowledge these inherent constraints and integrate human judgment at\ncritical junctures. These findings contribute to both theoretical\nunderstanding of AI epistemology and practical approaches to scholarly\ntool design.\n\n## - using LLM-based tools in participatory learning and teaching formats (including the course you designed, based on students' interests?)\n\nPapers: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44204-025-00247-1>\nand <https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/6mke5_v1> plus the papers (plural)\nI'm giving for <https://iacapconf.org/2025symposia/teachingAI>\n\nAbstract 2:\n\nThis paper examines pedagogical approaches for teaching with and about\nAI under conditions of technological uncertainty. Drawing on\nTransformative Learning Theory and the Rumsfeld Matrix, we demonstrate\nhow deliberately decoupling task success from assessment outcomes\ncreates educational environments where students develop sophisticated AI\nintuitions without grade-related inhibitions. Through structured\nrisk-taking, intentional classroom culture development, and navigation\nof \\\"unknown unknowns,\\\" students shifted from deferring to AI to\ndirecting it---developing internal AI-Locus of Control. This approach\nchallenges traditional educational paradigms emphasizing certainty;\ninstead embracing AI\\'s ambiguities as pedagogical opportunities that\nfoster critical thinking, epistemic humility, and student agency in\ntechnological environments characterized by continual change.\n\nI can also speak to unit details and lessons learned. Plus\nimplementation in other units (GRMN1020, AHIS1210, etc)\n\nBeyond this, one of the things I'm doing in a \"Laws of Armed Conflict\nunit\" relates to:\n\n\\\"Role-Based Prompting and Scenario Design\\\" - A creative application\nworkshop, demonstrating how to set up specialized AI scenarios for\ndiscipline-specific applications including legal, educational, and\nresearch contexts. (Simulations, wargames, and interactive applications\nfor future planning and teaching)\n\n## - implementing LLMS-based tools in the curriculum in the context of developing future skills (MQ term: transferable skills?)\n\nSo, in the context of the unit I taught, I asked the following questions\nof the students:\n\na\\) Identify effective uses of generative AI tools, techniques, and\ntechnologies in the unit so far\n\nb\\) Recommend AI tools and techniques for inclusion in a 1st year\n\\\"Techniques of AI\\\" unit\n\nc\\) Suggest AI tools and techniques for a final year \\\"Capstone with\nAI\\\" unit\n\nd\\) Reflect on the mentoring you\\'ve provided to teaching staff about\neffective AI teaching\n\nAnd I'd be delighted to present what the students think would be\nappropriate for an intro unit and a capstone unit in AI.\n\nI can also speak to the human requirement of judgement.\n<https://resobscura.substack.com/p/simulating-history-with-chatgpt> has\na wonderful line I quote all the time: \"But the thing is: LLMs are\ndeeply, inherently textual. And they are reliant on text in a way that\nis directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in\nuniversity humanities classes.\" And I can talk about the judgement of\nwhen to use the tool, the textual expertise needed to prompt well and\nevaluate the output, and the critical expertise of choosing which sort\nof tool to use in which style that are all essential and critical\ntransferrable skills.\n\n(I've just recently done a 6 hour workshop to the royal Australia New\nZealand College of Ophthalmology\\'s HREC committee on these sorts of\nquestions in an HREC/research guise.)\n\n## - insights gained re the contract of using LLMS-based tools that might apply in a university-context that is more driven by data-protection (I can send you the current rules that have been proposed by another local university if you would like to explore this aspect at all)\n\nYes, I can speak to this in extreme degree, about when to use local\nmodels, the implications of processing, the tedium of reading terms of\nservice, etc.\n\n## - gamification and LLMS (personally, I consider this as broadening the topic too much, but I am sharing this, just in case)\n\nI loathe the term, but maybe simulation counts for you folks?\n\nHere are my standard workshops:\n\n\\\"A Hands-on Introduction to Large Language Models like Anthropic\\'s\nClaude, Microsoft Copilot, and ChatGPT\\\" - A comprehensive 3-hour\nworkshop that teaches the pragmatic realities of these models and how to\nprompt them effectively. (Ethics of use, prompt \\\"engineering\\\", basic\nconcepts, everyday utility)\n\n\\\"Avoiding Sadness: Research Policy for Generative AI\\\" - An\nintroductory keynote that explores how institutions can develop balanced\npolicies that enable productive AI use while addressing key ethical\nconcerns.
