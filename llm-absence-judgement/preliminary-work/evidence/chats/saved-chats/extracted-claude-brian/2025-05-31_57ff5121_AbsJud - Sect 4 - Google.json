The system promises comprehensive literature discovery through Google's unparalleled web index, combined with advanced language understanding. Our evaluation revealed a tool that epitomises the concept of \"ultimate Carnapian confirmation\"\u2014accumulating evidence without critical examination\u2014while failing to leverage Google's own academic resources.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Google Gemini Performance Across Research Stages}\n\\label{tab:google-performance}\n\\begin{adjustbox}{width=\\textwidth}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm}p{3cm}p{4cm}p{4cm}p{2cm}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Research Stage} & \\textbf{Tool Tested} & \\textbf{Task Description} & \\textbf{Observed Failure Modes} & \\textbf{Judgment Type} \\\\\n\\midrule\nIdeation & Gemini Pro 2.5 & Generate research framework for DH analysis & Confused human/AI personas; ignored context & Epistemic Humility \\\\\nLiterature Discovery & Gemini Deep Research & Systematic tool identification in journals & Produced 20-page report instead of requested CSV & Inductive Reasoning \\\\\nData Collection & Gemini Deep Research & Extract structured data on software tools & \"Shotgun mass-summary\" without examination & Correspondence with Reality \\\\\nSource Synthesis & Gemini Pro 2.5 & Analyse DH program sustainability & Block processing prevented source verification & Correspondence with Reality \\\\\nWriting Support & Gemini Pro 2.5 & Transcription and summary tasks & Excellent transcription; poor analytical synthesis & Epistemic Humility \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsubsection{Ideation and Research Design}\n\nGemini's approach to research design revealed fundamental architectural limitations masked by surface-level competence. When tasked with identical prompts to other systems, Gemini consistently misunderstood task requirements despite explicit instructions. Most tellingly, in one session it confused human and AI personas, opening with \"I understand that we're focusing on section four, case studies of AI research tools\" before inexplicably swapping pronouns throughout its response. This identity confusion extended beyond mere linguistic errors to fundamental miscomprehension of task boundaries.\n\nThe system's \"light trigger\" sensitivity, as we characterised it, meant that minor prompt variations produced wildly different outputs. Despite advertising a million-token context window, Gemini performed markedly better with shorter, focused prompts. This brittleness to input variation undermined any pretence of systematic research capability, as identical tasks might yield a data table, a narrative report, or confused meta-commentary depending on subtle wording differences.\n\n\\subsubsection{Literature Discovery and Source Evaluation}\n\nGemini Deep Research's literature discovery approach exemplified pure technoscholasticism through what we term \"shotgun mass-summary\" methodology. The system would collect dozens of sources in blocks of 20-50, processing them simultaneously without evidence of individual examination. When instructed to systematically examine specific journals for software tool mentions and return structured data, it instead produced a 20-page narrative report. While the embedded table contained accurate dates including some that other systems missed, this success was undermined by the system's refusal to follow explicit output format instructions.\n\nMost damning was Gemini's failure to utilise Google Scholar despite Google's ownership of this premier academic search engine. Instead, it relied on general web searches, producing what one log entry described as \"trivial thinking-logs\" such as: \"I've made progress in accessing some key resources for understanding the current state of Digital Humanities. I successfully analyzed a chapter from 'Debates in the Digital Humanities' that highlighted the ongoing need for true collaboration.\" This surface-level engagement, extrapolating broad claims from single sources without triangulation, epitomised the absence of scholarly judgment.\n\n\\subsubsection{Data Collection and Extraction}\n\nThe system's approach to data collection revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of systematic research. Rather than methodically examining sources individually, Gemini appeared to run broad searches and select passages that seemed thematically relevant. Its logs showed no evidence of source-by-source evaluation or cross-referencing. When explicitly instructed to \"be specific, intentional, conscientious, meticulous, and triple-check your claims,\" the system maintained its scatter-shot approach, collecting URLs without examining their content in detail.\n\nThis pattern represented the ultimate expression of Carnapian confirmation bias\u2014accumulating any text that appeared relevant until reaching an internal confidence threshold, then synthesising these fragments into plausible-sounding but unverified claims. The system would confidently assert program vitality based on archived webpages, cite defunct initiatives as current, and show no recognition that academic programs fail silently rather than with explicit announcements.\n\n\\subsubsection{Implications for Research Practice}\n\nParadoxically, Gemini demonstrated excellence in one specific task: transcription. As noted in our testing logs, \"Gemini 2.5 Pro excels at transcription, outperforming alternatives.\" This mechanical competence without analytical capability perfectly encapsulates the tool's position\u2014useful for specific, bounded, judgment-free tasks while fundamentally unsuited for research requiring critical evaluation.\n\nThe system's failures stemmed not from technical limitations but from architectural decisions prioritising breadth over depth. By processing sources in bulk rather than individually, by ignoring its parent company's academic search capabilities, and by producing reports when asked for data, Gemini Deep Research demonstrated that sophisticated language generation cannot compensate for absence of judgment. Researchers might find utility in its transcription capabilities or its ability to surface broad themes, but must recognise it as the epitome of technoscholastic accumulation without critical assessment.",

          "text": "Looking through transcripts.tex for Google/Gemini references, I've identified key themes and quotes. Let me extract the most relevant ones:\n\n## Key Quotes from Transcripts\n\n### On Gemini's \"Deep Research\" Approach:\n> \"Gemini 'Deep Research with 2.5 Pro' (if we're being technical) was of the same kind as other offerings, but lacking in comparison. Despite having access to Google Search it demonstrated two significant limitations: 1. It never used Google Scholar, despite Google owning this resource 2. It employed a single-threaded approach, collecting an absurd number of hits per run without providing evidence that it examined anything in detail\"\n\n### On Its Fundamental Failure Pattern:\n> \"The fundamental failure of Gemini's approach is that it represents the ultimate in Carnapian confirmation\u2014essentially stamp collecting. It produces trivial thinking-logs like: 'I've made progress in accessing some key resources for understanding the current state of Digital Humanities. I successfully analyzed a chapter from 'Debates in the Digital Humanities' that highlighted the ongoing need for true collaboration between computer scientists and humanities scholars, the importance of robust infrastructure, and the potential for DH to drive new research questions.'\"\n\n### On Gemini's Self-Assessment Delusions:\n> \"Honestly it's just gaslighting itself. There's no way to 'successfully analyse a chapter' by... downloading a snippet. This is the source soup of undergrads using Google.\"\n\n### On Report Generation:\n> \"So it made a 20 page report. Oh my god. Anyways.\"\n> \"It wasn't what we asked for.\"\n> \"The other ones gave us what we asked for. This didn't.\"\n\n### On Model Characteristics:\n> \"Shawn: Small changes to prompts made surprisingly large differences in output quality, particularly with audio transcription tasks. The model seems to have what I'd call a 'light trigger'\u2014it's easily derailed or distracted during extended tasks.\"\n\n### On Comparative Performance:\n> \"When tasked with creating a more traditional annotated bibliography, Gemini significantly underperformed Claude Research. Not only were a higher proportion of its cited sources confabulated, but the sources it found were far less useful overall\u2014we added perhaps half as many to our Zotero bibliography compared to Claude's outputs.\"\n\n## Proposed Revised Outline for Section 4.3\n\n### Introduction (1 paragraph)\n- Google's positioning of Gemini as leveraging search dominance\n- Reality: stamp collecting without systematic evaluation\n\n### Table\n- Similar structure to OpenAI but emphasising single-threaded failures\n\n### 4.3.1 Architecture and Approach (2 paragraphs)\n- Single-threaded design collecting 100+ sources without depth\n- Failure to use Google Scholar despite owning it\n- \"Successfully analysed\" delusion pattern\n\n### 4.3.2 Literature Discovery Failures (2-3 paragraphs)\n- Carnapian confirmation as undergraduate source soup\n- Self-gaslighting about analytical accomplishments\n- DH example: conflating snippet downloading with chapter analysis\n- Confabulation rates and source quality issues\n\n### 4.3.3 Report Generation Problems (2 paragraphs)\n- Compulsion to produce reports regardless of task\n- 20-page outputs when asked for data\n- Failure to match user requirements\n\n### 4.3.4 Model Characteristics and Limitations (2 paragraphs)\n- \"Light trigger\" sensitivity and prompt brittleness\n- Arrogance without performance (italics/quotes example)\n- Mediocre question generation in auto-interview\n\n### 4.3.5 Implications (1-2 paragraphs)\n- Ultimate example of technoscholasticism\n- Tools in a loop without critical evaluation\n- Limited utility despite search advantages\n\nDoes this revised structure better capture the specific critiques you want to make about Gemini?",

The system promises systematic investigation through its integration with Google's vast search infrastructure. Our evaluation revealed a tool that epitomises the Carnapian confirmation approach through what we characterise as \"shotgun mass-summary\" methodology. Despite theoretical advantages in search access, Gemini demonstrated consistent judgment failures while producing voluminous outputs disconnected from user requirements.\n\n### Table II: Gemini Pro 2.5 Performance Across Research Stages\n\n| Research Stage | Tool Tested | Task Description | Observed Failure Modes | Judgment Type |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ideation | Gemini Pro 2.5 | Generate focused research questions | Conflated multiple complex tasks; poor question quality | Epistemic Humility |\n| Literature Discovery | Deep Research | Systematic DH program identification | \"Successfully analysed\" claims without actual analysis | Correspondence with Reality |\n| Data Collection | Deep Research | Extract structured tool data | Produced 20-page report instead of requested CSV | Inductive Reasoning |\n| Source Synthesis | Gemini Pro 2.5 | Build annotated bibliography | 50% fewer usable sources than Claude; high confabulation | Correspondence with Reality |\n| Writing Support | Gemini Pro 2.5 | Generate academic sections | Self-congratulatory progress claims; no critical evaluation | Epistemic Humility |\n\n### 4.3.1 Ideation and Research Design\n\nGemini's approach to research design revealed fundamental architectural limitations. The system consistently conflated multiple complex tasks into single operations, demonstrating poor task decomposition capabilities. When examining its thinking logs, we observed statements attempting to combine directory exploration, chapter analysis, and infrastructure assessment in a single step. This overreach reflected not ambition but a failure to understand research as an iterative process requiring focused investigation at each stage.\n\nThe model exhibited what we characterise as \"arrogance without performance\" in its linguistic choices. Its tendency to italicise and quote words suggested a stance of knowing better than the user, yet this confidence inversely correlated with output quality. In our auto-interview testing, Gemini's questions proved superior to O3's formulaic approach but lacked both the consistency of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and the occasional insights of GPT-4.5. This mediocrity in ideation, combined with its conflated task structures, positioned Gemini as particularly unsuited for the careful conceptual work research design requires.\n\n### 4.3.2 Literature Discovery and Source Evaluation\n\nThe literature discovery phase exposed Gemini's most characteristic failure pattern. Despite access to Google's search infrastructure, the system never utilised Google Scholar, instead relying on general web searches that produced what we term \"undergraduate source soup.\" The system would claim to have \"successfully analyzed a chapter from 'Debates in the Digital Humanities'\" when it had merely downloaded a snippet, then extrapolate broad conclusions about collaboration needs and infrastructure importance from this fragmentary engagement.\n\nThis self-deception reached absurd proportions in the thinking logs. After accessing a handful of web pages, the system would produce statements like \"I've made progress in accessing some key resources for understanding the current state of Digital Humanities.\" The gap between claimed accomplishment and actual analysis revealed a system essentially gaslighting itself about its capabilities. No critical evaluation occurred at any stage. The model accepted every source at face value, accumulating claims without assessing credibility, temporal relevance, or contradictions between sources.\n\nThe single-threaded architecture exacerbated these problems. While collecting over 100 sources per run, the system provided no evidence of systematic examination. Instead, it performed rapid stamp collecting, using search result snippets to construct narratives that bore little relationship to comprehensive scholarship. This approach produced the most extreme example of Carnapian confirmation we observed across all tested systems.\n\n### 4.3.3 Data Collection and Extraction\n\nGemini's data collection failures centred on its compulsive need to produce reports regardless of task requirements. When explicitly asked for structured data in CSV format, matching successful outputs from other systems, Gemini instead generated a 20-page narrative report. This fundamental inability to match output format to user requirements revealed a system optimised for voluminous text generation rather than practical research support.\n\nThe system demonstrated extreme sensitivity to prompt variations, what our testing characterised as a \"light trigger\" response. Minor wording changes produced dramatically different outputs, making reliable data extraction nearly impossible. This brittleness, combined with the compulsive report generation, meant that tasks requiring specific, structured outputs consistently failed. Where OpenAI's Deep Research eventually produced usable CSVs after iteration, Gemini remained locked in its narrative mode, delivering extensive prose when simple data tables were requested.\n\n### 4.3.4 Synthesis and Writing Support\n\nSynthesis tasks revealed Gemini's inability to distinguish between information aggregation and analytical integration. The system would produce self-congratulatory progress summaries asserting successful analysis of complex theoretical frameworks based on minimal snippet examination. When tasked with creating annotated bibliographies, Gemini's outputs proved notably inferior to competitors, with approximately half as many sources meeting quality thresholds for inclusion in our Zotero database.\n\nConfabulation rates exceeded those observed in other systems, with Gemini frequently inventing plausible-sounding citations that did not correspond to real publications. Unlike Anthropic's useful near-misses that could lead to relevant literature, Gemini's fabrications offered no serendipitous value. The combination of high confabulation, poor source quality, and self-deceptive progress claims rendered the system's synthesis capabilities effectively worthless for serious scholarly work.\n\n### 4.3.5 Implications for Research Practice\n\nGemini Deep Research represents the apotheosis of technoscholasticism among tested systems. Its combination of vast search access with complete absence of critical evaluation produces outputs that superficially resemble research while lacking all essential scholarly judgment. The system's single-threaded architecture, compulsive report generation, and self-deceptive progress claims create an illusion of comprehensive investigation that dissolves upon examination.\n\nFor practitioners, Gemini offers a cautionary example of how technical resources cannot compensate for judgment deficiencies. Despite Google's search advantages, the system underperformed all major competitors in practical research tasks. Its extreme prompt sensitivity and format rigidity further limit utility. Researchers should approach Gemini's outputs with particular scepticism, recognising that its confident progress claims and voluminous reports mask fundamental failures in source evaluation, temporal awareness, and critical analysis.",

The system promises systematic investigation through its integration with Google's vast search infrastructure. Our evaluation revealed a tool that epitomises the Carnapian confirmation approach through what we characterise as ``shotgun mass-summary'' methodology. Despite theoretical advantages in search access, Gemini demonstrated consistent judgment failures while producing voluminous outputs disconnected from user requirements.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Gemini Pro 2.5 Performance Across Research Stages}\n\\label{tab:gemini-performance}\n\\begin{adjustbox}{width=\\textwidth}\n\\begin{tabular}{p{2.5cm}p{3cm}p{4cm}p{4cm}p{2cm}}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{Research Stage} & \\textbf{Tool Tested} & \\textbf{Task Description} & \\textbf{Observed Failure Modes} & \\textbf{Judgment Type} \\\\\n\\midrule\nIdeation & Gemini Pro 2.5 & Generate focused research questions & Conflated multiple complex tasks; poor question quality & Epistemic Humility \\\\\nLiterature Discovery & Deep Research & Systematic DH program identification & ``Successfully analysed'' claims without actual analysis & Correspondence with Reality \\\\\nData Collection & Deep Research & Extract structured tool data & Produced 20-page report instead of requested CSV & Inductive Reasoning \\\\\nSource Synthesis & Gemini Pro 2.5 & Build annotated bibliography & 50\\% fewer usable sources than Claude; high confabulation & Correspondence with Reality \\\\\nWriting Support & Gemini Pro 2.5 & Generate academic sections & Self-congratulatory progress claims; no critical evaluation & Epistemic Humility \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsubsection{Ideation and Research Design}\n\nGemini's approach to research design revealed fundamental architectural limitations. The system consistently conflated multiple complex tasks into single operations, demonstrating poor task decomposition capabilities. When examining its thinking logs, we observed statements attempting to combine directory exploration, chapter analysis, and infrastructure assessment in a single step. This overreach reflected not ambition but a failure to understand research as an iterative process requiring focused investigation at each stage.\n\nThe model exhibited what we characterise as ``arrogance without performance'' in its linguistic choices. Its tendency to italicise and quote words suggested a stance of knowing better than the user, yet this confidence inversely correlated with output quality. In our auto-interview testing, Gemini's questions proved superior to O3's formulaic approach but lacked both the consistency of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and the occasional insights of GPT-4.5. This mediocrity in ideation, combined with its conflated task structures, positioned Gemini as particularly unsuited for the careful conceptual work research design requires.\n\n\\subsubsection{Literature Discovery and Source Evaluation}\n\nThe literature discovery phase exposed Gemini's most characteristic failure pattern. Despite access to Google's search infrastructure, the system never utilised Google Scholar, instead relying on general web searches that produced what we term ``undergraduate source soup.'' The system would claim to have ``successfully analyzed a chapter from 'Debates in the Digital Humanities''' when it had merely downloaded a snippet, then extrapolate broad conclusions about collaboration needs and infrastructure importance from this fragmentary engagement.\n\nThis self-deception reached absurd proportions in the thinking logs. After accessing a handful of web pages, the system would produce statements like ``I've made progress in accessing some key resources for understanding the current state of Digital Humanities.'' The gap between claimed accomplishment and actual analysis revealed a system essentially gaslighting itself about its capabilities. No critical evaluation occurred at any stage. The model accepted every source at face value, accumulating claims without assessing credibility, temporal relevance, or contradictions between sources.\n\nThe single-threaded architecture exacerbated these problems. While collecting over 100 sources per run, the system provided no evidence of systematic examination. Instead, it performed rapid stamp collecting, using search result snippets to construct narratives that bore little relationship to comprehensive scholarship. This approach produced the most extreme example of Carnapian confirmation we observed across all tested systems.\n\n\\subsubsection{Data Collection and Extraction}\n\nGemini's data collection failures centred on its compulsive need to produce reports regardless of task requirements. When explicitly asked for structured data in CSV format, matching successful outputs from other systems, Gemini instead generated a 20-page narrative report. This fundamental inability to match output format to user requirements revealed a system optimised for voluminous text generation rather than practical research support.\n\nThe system demonstrated extreme sensitivity to prompt variations, what our testing characterised as a ``light trigger'' response. Minor wording changes produced dramatically different outputs, making reliable data extraction nearly impossible. This brittleness, combined with the compulsive report generation, meant that tasks requiring specific, structured outputs consistently failed. Where OpenAI's Deep Research eventually produced usable CSVs after iteration, Gemini remained locked in its narrative mode, delivering extensive prose when simple data tables were requested.\n\n\\subsubsection{Synthesis and Writing Support}\n\nSynthesis tasks revealed Gemini's inability to distinguish between information aggregation and analytical integration. The system would produce self-congratulatory progress summaries asserting successful analysis of complex theoretical frameworks based on minimal snippet examination. When tasked with creating annotated bibliographies, Gemini's outputs proved notably inferior to competitors, with approximately half as many sources meeting quality thresholds for inclusion in our Zotero database.\n\nConfabulation rates exceeded those observed in other systems, with Gemini frequently inventing plausible-sounding citations that did not correspond to real publications. Unlike Anthropic's useful near-misses that could lead to relevant literature, Gemini's fabrications offered no serendipitous value. The combination of high confabulation, poor source quality, and self-deceptive progress claims rendered the system's synthesis capabilities effectively worthless for serious scholarly work.\n\n\\subsubsection{Implications for Research Practice}\n\nGemini Deep Research represents the apotheosis of technoscholasticism among tested systems. Its combination of vast search access with complete absence of critical evaluation produces outputs that superficially resemble research while lacking all essential scholarly judgment. The system's single-threaded architecture, compulsive report generation, and self-deceptive progress claims create an illusion of comprehensive investigation that dissolves upon examination.\n\nFor practitioners, Gemini offers a cautionary example of how technical resources cannot compensate for judgment deficiencies. Despite Google's search advantages, the system underperformed all major competitors in practical research tasks. Its extreme prompt sensitivity and format rigidity further limit utility. Researchers should approach Gemini's outputs with particular scepticism, recognising that its confident progress claims and voluminous reports mask fundamental failures in source evaluation, temporal awareness, and critical analysis.",

The platform promises scriptable access to research capabilities through direct filesystem interaction and API integration. Our evaluation, necessarily limited by prohibitive costs, revealed a system offering theoretical advantages undermined by economic realities. A single run cost \\$200 in o1-pro credits, constraining our testing to one elaboration task on the Open Archaeology tool dataset.\n\nThe system's distinguishing feature lies in its ability to interact with the filesystem and user-specified search APIs while running queries from a local university computer. This architecture theoretically enables more sophisticated workflows than web-based alternatives. In practice, our testing involved a structured data enhancement task: improving descriptions for archaeological software tools from the Open Archaeo dataset. The system successfully processed the CSV input and generated enhanced descriptions, demonstrating basic functional competence in structured data manipulation.\n\nHowever, performance fell significantly short of expectations. The outputs achieved approximately 60\\% of the quality obtainable through iterative chatbot interactions, despite the substantially higher cost. This performance deficit became particularly apparent when compared to reproducing the same functionality in Claude Research. While Claude required processing tools individually rather than in batches, it produced superior results at a fraction of the cost. The economic equation proved even less favourable when considering iteration requirements. Prompt refinement, essential for achieving acceptable outputs, would multiply the already prohibitive base cost.\n\nOpen Deep Research exemplifies a recurring pattern in AI research tools: promising architecture constrained by practical limitations. The scriptability and filesystem access offer genuine technical advantages for systematic research workflows. Yet these advantages dissolve when confronted with the economic reality of \\$200 per run producing outputs inferior to standard chatbot interfaces. For open-source research tool development, this presents a fundamental challenge. The infrastructure exists to create sophisticated research workflows, but the cost structure ensures they remain economically unviable for actual research use. Until either performance improves dramatically or costs decrease by orders of magnitude, Open Deep Research remains an interesting technical demonstration rather than a practical research tool.",

            "content": "\\subsection{Other Tools}\n\nSeveral additional tools demonstrated various approaches to ``agentic'' research, each failing in characteristic ways that reinforced our broader findings about judgment deficiencies in current AI implementations.\n\n\\textbf{OpenAI's Operator} functions as a technology demonstration rather than a practical research tool. The system lacks fundamental capabilities required for sustained research work: it cannot decompose tasks, maintain notes, or work to a plan. This architectural limitation prevents it from maintaining context across even simple data collection sequences. When attempting academic paper searches, Operator would begin appropriately but quickly lose track of its objective, becoming distracted by tangentially related content. The absence of task persistence or goal tracking renders it unsuitable for any research activity beyond the most trivial demonstrations.\n\n\\textbf{Anthropic's Computer Use} theoretically advances beyond browser-based limitations by running in a local Docker container, enabling access to desktop applications. This architectural innovation suggested promise for integrating traditional research software into AI workflows. However, practical testing revealed prohibitive costs exceeding even Open Deep Research, with API credits consumed rapidly for minimal progress. The system failed to complete basic tasks such as locating and loading academic papers. Despite its theoretical advantages in application access, Computer Use represents another instance where architectural sophistication cannot overcome fundamental judgment and operational limitations.\n\n\\textbf{Elicit} demonstrated the most structured approach among secondary tools, explicitly separating source discovery, evaluation, and synthesis phases. This conceptual architecture aligned well with research workflows. However, implementation failures negated these structural advantages. The system's dependence on Semantic Scholar severely limited coverage, particularly in humanities disciplines. Combined with an underpowered language model and reliance on AI-generated TLDR tags rather than full-text analysis, Elicit produced the lowest quality outputs among tested systems. From identical prompts, Elicit yielded only 9 useful sources compared to 55 from Deep Research. Despite claiming systematic review capabilities, its practical utility proved negligible.\n\n\\textbf{Perplexity's Research Mode} exemplified pure technoscholasticism without systematic ambition. The system optimised search queries effectively but demonstrated no evidence of source triangulation or critical assessment. When tasked with producing a literature review with citations, Perplexity claimed to analyse 25 sources while providing only 3 references. This gap between claimed and actual performance, combined with minimal reasoning capabilities and poor academic database access, positioned it as the epitome of accumulation without judgment. Its outputs represented sophisticated web searches rather than research assistance.\n\nThese implementations, despite varying technical approaches and market positioning, exhibited consistent patterns of failure. They privileged textual accumulation over critical evaluation, lacked temporal awareness, and demonstrated no capacity for assessing output quality against research objectives. Their uniform inability to transcend mechanical information gathering reinforces our central argument: current AI systems lack the judgment necessary for autonomous research, regardless of their architectural sophistication or marketed capabilities.",

Maintains Australian spelling (analyse, behaviour)\n5. Removes unnecessary words\n6. Creates better paragraph breaks\n7. Makes the transition from positive to negative smoother\n\nI should explain these changes briefly.",

The addition is valuable as it shows a tool partially addressing the systematicity problems identified throughout the paper.",
