Personally, I\u2019d be particularly interested in hearing about either your work on AI in deep research tasks, or about your EAL/D research with Hua-Chen.\n\n \n\n(Also interested in the teaching and assessment work, because I\u2019m involved in trying to restructure assessment on our Masters programs, but that\u2019s probably generally interesting less to other folks in the group not involved in teaching!)\n\n \n\nHowever,  if one particular area is easier for you to speak about, because you have more slides already prepared etc, please do feel free to speak about that and we can always have some more general Q &A to discuss your broader interests.\n\n## Introduction (whoami)\n\n## An Absence of Judgement: AI \"Deep Research\" \n\n## Theoretical Framework - Technoscholasticism\n\nAI Research Tools as Digital Scholastics: LLMs privilege textual authority over critical assessment, like medieval scholars\n\n### Three Dimensions of Judgment Deficiency:\n\n1. **Epistemic Humility** \n   - Cannot recognize own limitations\n   - Always produces answers regardless of knowledge\n   - \"Soft bullshit\" - indifference to truth\n\n2. **Inductive/Abductive Reasoning**\n   - No \"surprise\" at contradictions\n   - Cannot identify meaningful patterns or gaps\n   - Architecturally constrained by next-token prediction\n\n3. **Correspondence with Reality**\n   - Accepts text as truth without verification\n   - Cannot evaluate claims against world\n   - \"Discount Carnapian confirmation\"\n\nResult: Tools that perform language of research without its epistemic substance\n\n## Empirical Findings - Patterns Across All Systems\n\nConsistent Failures Across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google\n\n**Cross-Cutting Patterns:**\n- **Temporality Blindness**: Treat 2020 announcements as current programs\n- **Scope/Confabulation Trade-off**: Fixed effort regardless of task size\n- **Stamp Collecting**: Random walk until \"vibes\" threshold reached\n\n**Key Examples:**\n- Newcastle Centre: Ignored death notice, claimed active program\n- Digital Humanities: Built \"implausibly positive\" narratives from defunct programs\n- Software Dating: Overlooked \"developed since 1997\" while searching elsewhere\n\n**Implications:**\n- Not autonomous agents but tools requiring constant human judgment\n- Mundane utility inversely correlates with judgment requirements\n- Must work with model \"grain\" for narrow, bounded tasks\n\n**Bottom Line**: Technoscholasticism is fundamental characteristic, not correctable flaw\n\n(Possible Audience digression: agentic rant/llms calling tools in a loop (current) -> goal-following (Agentic) -> Goal Setting (AGI))\n\n# EAL/D Vocabulary Learning: AI-Powered Robust Instruction\n\n## Research Context & Goals\n- **Target Audience**: Primary school EAL/D students in Sydney, Australia\n  - Year 5-6 students\n  - Home languages: Chinese (Mandarin), French\n  - Beginning to intermediate English proficiency\n- **Technical Stack**: ASR \u2192 LLM \u2192 TTS pipeline\n- **Pedagogical Framework**: NSW Robust Vocabulary Instruction\n  - Tier 2: High-frequency academic words (e.g., environment, survival, predict)\n  - Tier 3: Domain-specific terms (e.g., hibernation, camouflage, evaporation)\n\n:::: {.notes}\nBuilding a prototype that serves dual purpose: demonstrating core functionality and providing a well-documented reference for professional design firms\n::::\n\n## Implementing NSW Explicit Teaching Techniques\n\n### SEEC Framework in Action\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Select & Explain**\n- Provide word + L1 translation\n- Syllable breakdown pronunciation\n- Student-friendly definitions\n- Contextual examples\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n**Explore & Consolidate**\n- Association activities (3 words: 1 match, 2 distractors)\n- Multiple exposures (7+ encounters)\n- Sentence creation with scaffolding\n- Progressive independence\n:::\n::::\n\n### Activity Flow\n1. **Model**: Word introduction with translation and pronunciation\n2. **Guide**: Association activities with immediate feedback\n3. **Apply**: Sentence creation (scaffolded \u2192 independent)\n\n\n\n## AI Interaction Patterns & Findings\n\n### Cross-Model Observations\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Effective Patterns**\n- Adaptive pronunciation support\n- Culturally relevant examples (Sydney landmarks)\n- Patient error correction\n- L1 bridge when needed\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Key Variations**\n- **Claude**: Strong SEEC adherence, natural dialogue\n- **GPT**: Structured progression, clear formatting\n- **Gemini**: Detailed explanations, engaging tone\n:::\n::::\n\n### Design Implications\n- Modular activity structure enables consistent implementation\n- Test-driven development ensures pedagogical fidelity\n- Multi-model approach reveals optimal interaction patterns\n- Clear documentation bridges research \u2192 production\n\n:::: {.notes}\nData shows 70+ evaluation criteria tracked across prompts, measuring both task completion and pedagogical quality\n::::\n\n# Teaching with and about  AI\n\n# AI in Teaching and asessment for postgrads\n\n# Research Policy\n\n\n## Q&A\n"
