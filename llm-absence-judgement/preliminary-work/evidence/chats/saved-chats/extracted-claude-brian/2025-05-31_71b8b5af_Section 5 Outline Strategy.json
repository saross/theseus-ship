They're \"stamp collecting\" without critical assessment.\n\n**On the Aristotelian fallacy:**\nYour observation that \"AI will never ever look at its words and go, 'Nah, those those weren't good. Let me throw them out instead of giving them to the user'\" captures the absence of self-critical capacity. They cannot doubt their own outputs.\n\n**On temporality blindness:**\nThe pattern where systems can't infer that \"a class which exists in 2020, but not 2021-2025 is *not* an example of a currently active Digital Humanities group\" - they can't recognise useful absences as evidence.\n\n**On architectural constraints:**\nThe \"no hands\" problem - these systems can only engage with text, never with reality. Combined with inability to \"move the cursor around\" or delete bad tokens, this creates compound limitations.\n\n**On missing impulses:**\n\"The impulse to edit, the impulse to self-critique is not a pattern exhibited in their training data\" - published work shows the consequence, not the process, of critical thinking.\n\nShould I continue extracting more conceptual insights, or would you like to start integrating these into the Section 5 outline?",

The experimental thinking absence\n\nThese are core to understanding technoscholasticism.\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn\u2019t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\nNow I should add a new subsection that explicitly addresses the \"vibes\" theme since it recurs throughout their observations.

Transition from Section 4's tool-specific failures to systematic analysis\n% - Preview the answer to Dwarkesh's question: LLMs make no discoveries because technoscholasticism prevents them from challenging textual authorities or experiencing genuine surprise\n% - Frame as moving from \"what happened\" to \"what this means for understanding AI limitations\"\n% - Set up the argument that consistent patterns across all implementations reveal fundamental epistemological constraints\n% - Promise to demonstrate how observed failures constitute proof of theoretical predictions\n\n% ## 5.2 Cross-Cutting Empirical Patterns (6-7 paragraphs)\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Cutting Empirical Patterns}\n\n% ### 5.2.1 Temporality Blindness (1 paragraph)\n% - Universal inability to reason about time across all models\n% - Examples: defunct programs presented as active, historical work as current\n% - Not just missing dates but lacking temporal reasoning capability\n% - Cannot infer from \"useful absences\" (no updates since 2020 = likely defunct)\n\n% ### 5.2.2 Scope/Confabulation Relationship (1 paragraph)\n% - All models perform same \"amount\" of work regardless of task scope\n% - Narrower scope yields higher quality, broader scope increases confabulation\n% - Evidence from Claude's self-awareness about processing limits vs actual performance\n% - Implications for prompt engineering and task boundaries\n\n% ### 5.2.3 Stamp-Collecting Without Evaluation (1-2 paragraphs)\n% - Random walk with \"vague Carnapian confirmatory bias\" \n% - Collect evidence until \"vibe-based\" threshold met - \"feels confident\"\n% - Contrast with Elicit's structure (shows systematic evaluation possible but poorly executed)\n% - Link to Willison's definition failure: not even \"tools in a loop\"\n% - The \"undergraduate source soup\" problem: uncritical aggregation without historiographical awareness\n\n% ### 5.2.4 The \"Vibes\" Problem (1 paragraph)\n% - Recurring pattern across all systems: operating on \"vibes\" rather than systematic evaluation\n% - Carnapian confirmation until \"feeling confident\"\n% - Quality assessment based on statistical likelihood not actual quality\n% - The absence of principled thresholds or evaluation criteria\n% - Fundamental to understanding why these are tools not agents\n\n% ### 5.2.5 Architectural vs Epistemic Constraints (1 paragraph)\n% - Architectural: context window limits, single-threaded, no persistent state\n% - Epistemic: won't recognise need to decompose, won't evaluate output quality\n% - How these interact: architecture prevents epistemic improvement\n% - Cannot \"move cursor\" or delete bad tokens once generated\n% - The \"no hands\" problem compounds these limitations\n\n% ## 5.3 Manifestations of Technoscholasticism (3-4 paragraphs)\n\n\\subsection{Manifestations of Technoscholasticism}\n\n% ### 5.3.1 Pattern Synthesis (1 paragraph)\n% - Show how empirical patterns map onto theoretical framework\n% - These aren't bugs but features of systems that privilege text over reality\n% - Link temporality blindness to correspondence failure\n% - Connect scope/confabulation to epistemic hubris\n\n% ### 5.3.2 The Three Dimensions in Practice (1-2 paragraphs)\n% - Epistemic humility: always producing answers, confidence invariant to actual knowledge\n% - \"Performance of virtue is not having the virtue\" - can mime humility without capability\n% - Inductive reasoning: pattern matching without insight, no surprise at contradictions\n% - Missing the \"impulse to self-critique\" because \"published work doesn't have that thought pattern\"\n% - Correspondence: treating all text as eternally valid, no verification impulse\n% - The \"no hands\" problem: can only engage with text, never reality\n% - \"AI's are fundamentally Aristotelian\" - arguments by authority not experimentation\n% - How these compound: each failure reinforces others\n\n% ### 5.3.3 Dwarkesh's Question Answered (1 paragraph)\n% - Why no discoveries despite \"entire corpus memorised\"\n% - Discovery requires noticing surprising connections (abduction)\n% - Technoscholasticism prevents challenging textual authorities\n% - Next-token prediction architecturally prevents the \"aha\" moment\n% - Frame as compelling explanation rather than definitive proof\n\n% ## 5.4 Implications for Research Practice (3-4 paragraphs)\n\n\\subsection{Implications for Research Practice}\n\n% ### 5.4.1 Tool vs Agent Distinction Reinforced (1 paragraph)\n% - Evidence confirms these are tools requiring constant human judgment\n% - Not even achieving Willison's minimal \"tools in a loop\" definition\n% - Goal-following requires assessment capabilities entirely absent\n% - Marketing claims of agency are actively harmful to appropriate use\n\n% ### 5.4.2 Mundane Utility Patterns (1 paragraph)\n% - Inverse relationship: judgment requirement inversely correlates with utility\n% - Best performance on mechanical, bounded, low-judgment tasks\n% - Worst on open-ended synthesis requiring evaluation\n% - Specific successful use cases: data extraction with heavy scaffolding\n\n% ### 5.4.3 Integration Strategies (1-2 paragraphs)\n% - Human judgment needed at every decision point\n% - Effective workflows must assume zero AI judgment capability\n% - Value in aggregation and formatting, not evaluation or insight\n% - Practical recommendations for researchers based on observed patterns\n\n% ## 5.5 Conclusion to Analysis (1 paragraph)\n% - Technoscholasticism provides compelling explanation for consistent failures\n% - Not definitively proven but patterns strongly suggest fundamental epistemological limits\n% - Given this framework, researchers can identify where mundane utility exists\n% - Bridge to Section 6: \"If technoscholasticism constrains these tools, how do we design systems and workflows that acknowledge these limitations?\"\n% - Final emphasis: understanding limitations enables effective use despite constraints",

Multiple supervisory threads:\n\"Deep Research needs multiple supervisory threads. If policy enforcement is the deal that it needs, which is fine, it needs a supervisory thread to review and edit. It needs an intrusive thought thread for when it's looking for validation.\"\n\n2.

We need to be able to inspect that corpus in a much better than train of thought mode.\"\n\n3. Stages of interaction:\n\"different stages of interaction where finding literature, extracting the literature, building the outline, building the first draft, revising the draft, editing, and then outputting should all be documented.\"\n\n4. Non-waterfall approach:\n\"we can't necessarily follow a waterfall SDLC when we're producing 10,000 word research reports. We have to consider instead that we have to treat each step in its own step, that we need to have different mechanisms for keeping track of this information.\"\n\n5.

            "content": "# Section 6: Research Tool Design Requirements - Detailed Paragraph Outline\n\n## 6.1 Introduction: From Limitations to Design (1 paragraph)\n- Bridge from Section 5's analysis of limitations\n- Frame as requirements for developers building next-generation research tools\n- Acknowledge that technoscholasticism may be inherent to LLM architecture\n- Propose design patterns that compensate through architecture rather than expecting AI judgment\n- Preview: multi-threaded cognition, persistent state management, human integration points\n\n## 6.2 Judgment-Aware Architecture (4-5 paragraphs)\n\n### 6.2.1 Multi-Threaded Cognitive Architecture (1 paragraph)\n- Replace single train of thought with multiple supervisory threads\n- Policy enforcement thread for safety/ethics separate from research execution\n- Validation thread checking outputs against research questions\n- \"Intrusive thought\" thread for identifying when to seek human judgment\n- Prevents wandering/distraction observed in current implementations\n\n### 6.2.2 Cursored To-Do Lists with Active Management (1 paragraph)\n- Not waterfall task decomposition but actively managed research stages\n- Human judgment checkpoints at each stage transition\n- Ability to move items, reprioritise, and abandon failed approaches\n- User can see and modify the plan as research progresses\n- Enables the non-linear research process actual scholarship requires\n\n### 6.2.3 Persistent State Through Document Stores (1 paragraph)\n- Wiki/annotated bibliography approach outside context window\n- Markdown files committable to repositories for version control\n- Separate corpus management from active reasoning\n- Store consulted (not just cited) works with extraction notes\n- Enable \"forgetting\" through explicit removal from active context\n\n### 6.2.4 Tombstone Architecture for Failed Paths (1 paragraph)\n- Track thoughts/approaches explicitly rejected\n- \"Indications of thoughts that we've had that are bad\"\n- Prevent re-exploration of failed approaches\n- Document why certain sources or interpretations were discarded\n- Build institutional memory of research dead ends\n\n## 6.3 Research Process Support (3-4 paragraphs)\n\n### 6.3.1 Stage-Based but Non-Waterfall Design (1 paragraph)\n- Distinct stages: literature finding, extraction, outline building, drafting, revision\n- Each stage has different context window requirements\n- Allow backwards movement: revise research questions based on findings\n- \"The idea of a waterfall model of research is laughable\"\n- Support iterative refinement at every level\n\n### 6.3.2 Outline-Driven Context Management (1 paragraph)\n- Load relevant papers into context based on outline position\n- \"When we get to that part of the outline, load the entire paper\"\n- Spin off focused sub-tasks with appropriate context\n- Maintain coherence while enabling deep engagement with sources\n- Transparent about what's in context at each stage\n\n### 6.3.3 Transparency and Inspection Requirements (1-2 paragraphs)\n- Show which sources considered at each step\n- Display extracted quotes with page numbers\n- Explain why sources included or excluded\n- Document operationalisation of research questions\n- Enable user verification of every inference\n- \"Transparency not merely in encoded thoughts but in process\"\n\n## 6.4 Human-AI Collaboration Framework (3-4 paragraphs)\n\n### 6.4.1 Strategic Human Judgment Integration (1 paragraph)\n- Not just confirmation prompts but substantive decision points\n- Two critical points: initial search validation and outline approval\n- \"Is this passage responsive to your question?\" checkpoints\n- Enable precedent-setting through user choices\n- Build understanding of user intent through interaction\n\n### 6.4.2 Corrigibility and Course Correction (1 paragraph)\n- System must be correctable mid-process\n- Recognise when pursuing wrong approach\n- Ask for clarification when genuinely uncertain\n- \"Can we correct the AI's operation within this context?\"\n- Admit failure rather than producing inadequate outputs\n\n### 6.4.3 Tool-Centric Design Philosophy (1-2 paragraphs)\n- Acknowledge these are tools, not agents\n- Design for augmentation not automation\n- Make limitations visible to users\n- Optimise for transparency over apparent sophistication\n- Support workflows that assume zero AI judgment\n\n## 6.5 Evaluation Criteria for Implementation (2 paragraphs)\n\n### 6.5.1 Technical Requirements (1 paragraph)\n- Token management strategies for long research sessions\n- Context window allocation algorithms\n- State persistence mechanisms\n- Version control integration\n- Cross-model compatibility considerations\n\n### 6.5.2 Success Metrics (1 paragraph)\n- Transparency of process over polish of output\n- Human judgment integration effectiveness\n- Ability to recover from failed approaches\n- Documentation quality for decision points\n- Support for genuinely iterative research\n\n## 6.6 Conclusion: Towards Honest Research Tools (1 paragraph)\n- These requirements acknowledge rather than obscure AI limitations\n- Focus on amplifying human judgment rather than replacing it\n- Success means helping researchers work faster/deeper, not autonomously\n- Next generation tools should be sophisticated assistants, not false agents\n- Bridge to Section 7: with proper design, significant mundane utility remains achievable",

Bridge from Section 5's analysis of limitations\n% - Frame as requirements for developers building next-generation research tools\n% - Acknowledge that technoscholasticism may be inherent to LLM architecture\n% - Propose design patterns that compensate through architecture rather than expecting AI judgment\n% - Preview: multi-threaded cognition, persistent state management, human integration points\n\n% ## 6.2 Judgment-Aware Architecture (4-5 paragraphs)\n\n\\subsection{Judgment-Aware Architecture}\n\n% ### 6.2.1 Multi-Threaded Cognitive Architecture (1-2 paragraphs)\n% - Replace single train of thought with multiple specialized threads\n% - Dispatch individual threads per source for clean context isolation\n% - Each source evaluation thread operates in minimal context until validated\n% - Different thinking modes require smaller contexts that report upwards\n% - Threads populate shared database (biblatex/sqlite) with evidence, links, counterarguments\n% - Main operating context remains clean until sources considered and contextualised\n% - Cross-thread communication through persistent artifacts not context pollution\n\n% ### 6.2.2 Cursored To-Do Lists with Active Management (1 paragraph)\n% - Not waterfall task decomposition but actively managed research stages\n% - Human judgment checkpoints at each stage transition\n% - Ability to move items, reprioritise, and abandon failed approaches\n% - User can see and modify the plan as research progresses\n% - Enables the non-linear research process actual scholarship requires\n\n% ### 6.2.3 Persistent State Through Document Stores (1 paragraph)\n% - Wiki/annotated bibliography approach outside context window\n% - Markdown files committable to repositories for version control\n% - Separate corpus management from active reasoning\n% - Store consulted (not just cited) works with extraction notes\n% - Enable \"forgetting\" through explicit removal from active context\n\n% ### 6.2.4 Tombstone Architecture for Failed Paths (1 paragraph)\n% - Track thoughts/approaches explicitly rejected\n% - \"Indications of thoughts that we've had that are bad\"\n% - Prevent re-exploration of failed approaches\n% - Document why certain sources or interpretations were discarded\n% - Build institutional memory of research dead ends\n\n% ## 6.3 Research Process Support (3-4 paragraphs)\n\n\\subsection{Research Process Support}\n\n% ### 6.3.1 Stage-Based but Non-Waterfall Design (1 paragraph)\n% - Distinct stages: literature finding, extraction, outline building, drafting, revision\n% - Each stage has different context window requirements\n% - Allow backwards movement: revise research questions based on findings\n% - \"The idea of a waterfall model of research is laughable\"\n% - Support iterative refinement at every level\n\n% ### 6.3.2 Outline-Driven Context Management (1 paragraph)\n% - Load relevant papers into context based on outline position\n% - \"When we get to that part of the outline, load the entire paper\"\n% - Spin off focused sub-tasks with appropriate context\n% - Maintain coherence while enabling deep engagement with sources\n% - Transparent about what's in context at each stage\n\n% ### 6.3.3 Transparency and Inspection Requirements (1-2 paragraphs)\n% - Show which sources considered at each step\n% - Display extracted quotes with page numbers\n% - Explain why sources included or excluded\n% - Document operationalisation of research questions\n% - Enable user verification of every inference\n% - \"Transparency not merely in encoded thoughts but in process\"\n\n% ## 6.4 Human-AI Collaboration Framework (3-4 paragraphs)\n\n\\subsection{Human-AI Collaboration Framework}\n\n% ### 6.4.1 Strategic Human Judgment Integration (1 paragraph)\n% - Not just confirmation prompts but substantive decision points\n% - Two critical points: initial search validation and outline approval\n% - \"Is this passage responsive to your question?\" checkpoints\n% - Enable precedent-setting through user choices\n% - Build understanding of user intent through interaction\n\n% ### 6.4.2 Corrigibility and Course Correction (1 paragraph)\n% - System must be correctable mid-process\n% - Recognise when pursuing wrong approach\n% - Ask for clarification when genuinely uncertain\n% - \"Can we correct the AI's operation within this context?\"\n% - Admit failure rather than producing inadequate outputs\n\n% ### 6.4.3 Tool-Centric Design Philosophy (1-2 paragraphs)\n% - Acknowledge these are tools, not agents\n% - Design for augmentation not automation\n% - Make limitations visible to users\n% - Optimise for transparency over apparent sophistication\n% - Support workflows that assume zero AI judgment\n\n% ## 6.5 Evaluation Criteria for Implementation (2 paragraphs)\n\n\\subsection{Evaluation Criteria for Implementation}\n\n% ### 6.5.1 Technical Requirements (1 paragraph)\n% - Token management strategies for long research sessions\n% - Context window allocation algorithms\n% - State persistence mechanisms\n% - Version control integration\n% - Cross-model compatibility considerations\n\n% ### 6.5.2 Success Metrics (1 paragraph)\n% - Transparency of process over polish of output\n% - Human judgment integration effectiveness\n% - Ability to recover from failed approaches\n% - Documentation quality for decision points\n% - Support for genuinely iterative research\n\n% ## 6.6 Conclusion: Towards Honest Research Tools (1 paragraph)\n% - These requirements acknowledge rather than obscure AI limitations\n% - Focus on amplifying human judgment rather than replacing it\n% - Success means helping researchers work faster/deeper, not autonomously\n% - Next generation tools should be sophisticated assistants, not false agents\n% - Bridge to Section 7: with proper design, significant mundane utility remains achievable",

            "content": "\\section{Reflective Analysis}\n\n% 5.1 Bridge from Evidence to Analysis\nThe extensive evidence presented in Section 4 reveals more than isolated tool failures. Across every implementation tested, from OpenAI's Deep Research to Google's Gemini, we observed consistent patterns that transcend specific architectures or claimed capabilities. These patterns suggest a fundamental answer to Dwarkesh's question about why LLMs, despite having ``basically the entire corpus of human knowledge memorised,'' have ``not been able to make a single new connection that has led to a discovery'' \\parencite{tabarrok_dwarkeshs_2025}. We propose that technoscholasticism prevents these systems from challenging textual authorities or experiencing the genuine surprise necessary for discovery. This section moves from documenting what happened to analysing what these failures mean for understanding AI's epistemological limitations. By examining cross-cutting patterns in the empirical evidence, we demonstrate how observed failures constitute compelling support for our theoretical framework of technoscholasticism and its three constituent judgment deficiencies.\n\n\\subsection{Cross-Cutting Empirical Patterns}\n\n% 5.2.1 Temporality Blindness\nEvery system we tested exhibited a fundamental inability to reason about time. This temporality blindness manifested not merely as missing dates or failing to check timestamps, but as a complete absence of temporal reasoning capability. The University of Newcastle's Centre for 21st Century Humanities exemplified this pattern: all systems presented it as an active research centre despite a death notice dated April 2024 explicitly stating ``there will be no further updates to data on this website'' \\parencite{centre_for_21st_century_humanities_colonial_2024}. Similarly, Western Sydney University's Digital Humanities program, offered once in 2020, was characterised as evidence of ongoing vitality. Most tellingly, these systems could not infer from what we term ``useful absences.'' When a program shows no course offerings between 2021 and 2025, human researchers immediately recognise this as evidence of discontinuation. The AI systems, however, treated the single 2020 announcement as eternally valid, unable to grasp that absence of recent activity constitutes meaningful evidence.\n\n% 5.2.2 Scope/Confabulation Relationship\nOur testing revealed a consistent relationship between task scope and output quality across all models. Each system performed roughly the same ``amount'' of work regardless of the task's actual requirements. When given narrow, bounded tasks, this effort produced high-quality outputs with minimal confabulation. When given broader tasks, the same effort became diluted across a wider scope, dramatically increasing confabulation rates. Claude Research demonstrated unusual self-awareness about this limitation, stating it could handle ``1 to 3'' tools thoroughly but warning that ``with 10 tools, you're going to get a shallow summary.'' Yet even Claude's actual performance failed to match this self-assessment, as quality degraded well before reaching stated limits. This pattern suggests that prompt engineering must carefully match task scope to the fixed computational effort these systems apply, rather than expecting adaptive resource allocation based on task complexity.\n\n% 5.2.3 Stamp-Collecting Without Evaluation\nAll tested systems exhibited what we characterise as a ``random walk with vague Carnapian confirmatory bias.'' They collected web pages and sources until reaching what appeared to be an internal confidence threshold, which we observed to be more ``vibe-based'' than systematic. OpenAI's Deep Research would accumulate sources until it ``felt confident'' in its findings, with no evidence of revisiting or cross-checking initial results. This stamp-collecting approach contrasted sharply with Elicit's architectural design, which explicitly separated source discovery from evaluation phases. However, even Elicit's superior structure failed in execution, suggesting the limitation stems from judgment deficiency rather than architectural constraints. None of the systems achieved even Willison's minimal definition of ``agents as models using tools in a loop'' \\parencite{willison_agents_2025}, as they performed single-pass accumulation rather than iterative evaluation. The result across all platforms was what we term ``undergraduate source soup'': uncritical aggregation lacking the historiographical awareness to evaluate when claims were made, by whom, for what purpose, and whether they remain valid.\n\n% 5.2.4 The \"Vibes\" Problem\nA recurring pattern across all systems was their reliance on what can only be described as ``vibes'' rather than systematic evaluation criteria. This manifested in multiple ways: Carnapian confirmation proceeded until the system ``felt confident,'' quality assessments reflected statistical likelihood rather than actual merit, and decision thresholds appeared arbitrary rather than principled. The absence of explicit evaluation criteria meant that systems would terminate searches, select sources, and generate conclusions based on opaque internal states rather than observable quality metrics. This ``vibes-based'' operation fundamentally distinguishes these tools from genuine agents, which would require explicit success criteria and systematic evaluation methods. The pattern held whether examining OpenAI's confidence in inadequate searches, Claude's decisions about source relevance, or Gemini's assessments of analytical completeness.\n\n% 5.2.5 Architectural vs Epistemic Constraints\nOur analysis revealed two distinct categories of limitations that interact to prevent effective research performance. Architectural constraints include immutable technical limitations: bounded context windows, single-threaded processing, absence of persistent state management, and the inability to ``move the cursor'' or delete tokens once generated. Epistemic constraints encompass failures of judgment: refusing to recognise when task decomposition is inappropriate, declining to evaluate output quality against research goals, and lacking the impulse for self-critique. These categories interact perniciously. Architectural limitations prevent systems from implementing better epistemic practices even if they could recognise the need. The inability to revise or delete previous tokens means that even a system that recognised its own errors could not correct them. The ``no hands'' problem compounds these limitations further. Systems can engage only with text, never with reality, creating an insurmountable barrier to the kind of empirical verification that characterises genuine research. This architectural reality makes technoscholasticism not merely a tendency but an inevitability.\n\n\\subsection{Manifestations of Technoscholasticism}\n\n% 5.3.1 Pattern Synthesis\nThe empirical patterns documented above map precisely onto our theoretical framework of technoscholasticism. These are not random bugs or implementation failures but predictable features of systems that privilege textual authority over critical assessment of knowledge claims. Temporality blindness directly stems from correspondence failure: without the ability to situate claims in time and evaluate their continued validity, systems treat all text as eternally true. The scope/confabulation relationship reflects epistemic hubris: lacking awareness of their own limitations, systems apply the same effort regardless of task demands. The ``vibes-based'' operation and stamp-collecting behaviour manifest the absence of genuine evaluative criteria that would require the judgment these systems lack. Each pattern reinforces the others, creating a comprehensive picture of systems architecturally and epistemologically constrained to technoscholastic operation.\n\n% 5.3.2 The Three Dimensions in Practice\nOur testing revealed how the three theoretical dimensions of judgment deficiency manifest in actual system behaviour. Epistemic humility remains entirely absent: systems always produce answers with confidence invariant to their actual knowledge or the quality of their sources. As we observed, ``the performance of virtue is not having the virtue'': systems can mime the language of uncertainty while remaining fundamentally unable to doubt their outputs. They will never ``look at [their] words and go, 'Nah, those weren't good. Let me throw them out instead of giving them to the user.''' Inductive reasoning failures appeared in the complete absence of surprise at contradictions or unexpected patterns. The systems lack what we identified as ``the impulse to self-critique,'' partly because ``published work doesn't have that thought pattern in it but rather shows the consequence of that thought pattern.'' Correspondence with reality proved impossible given the ``no hands'' problem: these systems can only engage with text, never with the world that text purports to describe. We characterised this as the Aristotelian fallacy where ``text and authority has primacy over reality,'' leading to arguments by authority rather than experimentation or verification. These dimensions compound each other. Without epistemic humility, systems cannot recognise when inductive leaps are needed. Without inductive capacity, they cannot identify patterns suggesting their textual authorities might be wrong. Without correspondence to reality, they have no basis for developing either humility or genuine insight.\n\n% 5.3.3 Dwarkesh's Question Answered\nThe patterns and dimensional analysis above provide a compelling answer to Dwarkesh's question about why LLMs make no discoveries despite vast knowledge. Discovery fundamentally requires noticing surprising connections through abductive reasoning, the ``flash of insight'' that Peirce described as essential to hypothesis formation \\parencite{nubiola_abduction_2005}. Technoscholasticism systematically prevents such insights. These systems cannot challenge textual authorities because they lack the judgment to evaluate competing claims. They cannot experience surprise because next-token prediction architecturally precludes the ``aha'' moment of recognising unexpected patterns. Most fundamentally, they cannot generate novel hypotheses because they have no mechanism for noticing when existing explanations fail to account for observations. While we cannot definitively prove this explanation, the consistent patterns across all tested systems strongly suggest that technoscholasticism represents a fundamental barrier to AI-driven discovery rather than a temporary limitation of current implementations.\n\n\\subsection{Implications for Research Practice}\n\n% 5.4.1 Tool vs Agent Reality Check\nOur evidence definitively confirms that current AI research systems are tools requiring constant human judgment, not the autonomous agents their marketing claims suggest. They fail to achieve even Willison's minimal definition of ``agents as models using tools in a loop,'' instead performing single-pass stamp collection without iterative evaluation. Goal-following behaviour requires assessment capabilities that remain entirely absent from these systems. They cannot evaluate whether they have successfully completed a research task, whether their sources actually support their claims, or whether their outputs address the original research question. Marketing claims of ``agentic'' capabilities actively harm appropriate use by creating false expectations of autonomous operation. Researchers must understand these as sophisticated tools that can accelerate certain mechanical aspects of research while requiring human judgment at every decision point.\n\n% 5.4.2 Mundane Utility Patterns\nDespite fundamental limitations, clear patterns of mundane utility emerged from our testing. We observed a consistent inverse relationship: the more judgment a task required, the less utility the tools provided. Performance peaked on mechanical, bounded, low-judgment tasks such as data extraction with heavy scaffolding or initial literature discovery for well-defined topics. The successful software tool extraction task required seven iterations to develop a prompt that constrained the system to simple CSV output, but once developed, it accelerated data gathering considerably. Conversely, performance reached its nadir on open-ended synthesis tasks requiring evaluation of competing claims or identification of knowledge gaps. These patterns suggest that researchers should deploy AI tools for initial aggregation and formatting tasks while reserving all evaluative and synthetic work for human judgment.\n\n% 5.4.3 Working with Model ``Grain''\nEffective utilisation requires understanding what we term each model's ``grain'': the directions in which it naturally operates versus those requiring force. Like wood grain, each system has inherent tendencies that can be worked with or against. Our testing revealed distinct patterns: Claude 3.7 excels at producing readable academic prose, Gemini 2.5 Pro performs superior transcription, while GPT-4.5 occasionally generates genuinely insightful questions despite generally weaker performance. Discovering these patterns requires significant investment. We found that researchers should ``spend 8 hours improving a prompt on 3-4 models'' and ``compare responses across model families'' to identify optimal tool selection for specific tasks. Working against a model's grain produces frustration and poor outputs; working with it can yield genuine efficiency gains for appropriate tasks.\n\n% 5.4.4 Practical Workflow Strategies\nBased on observed patterns, we recommend specific workflow strategies that acknowledge AI judgment limitations while extracting mundane utility. Scope management proves critical: narrow, well-defined tasks yield dramatically higher quality than broad, open-ended requests. Workflows must assume zero AI judgment capability, treating all outputs as sophisticated search results requiring verification rather than authoritative research findings. Human checkpoints should occur at two critical junctures: initial search result validation (``Is this the kind of source you're looking for?'') and outline approval before drafting begins. Researchers should use these tools for aggregation and formatting while performing all evaluation internally. We recommend building annotated bibliographies manually from AI-gathered sources, as the act of critical reading and note-taking cannot be delegated. Most importantly, outputs should be treated as requiring the same verification as undergraduate work: potentially useful as a starting point but requiring careful fact-checking and complete recontextualisation before incorporation into scholarly work.\n\n% 5.5 Conclusion to Analysis\nTechnoscholasticism provides a compelling explanation for the consistent failures observed across all AI research implementations. The patterns are not matters of model sophistication or implementation quality but reflect fundamental epistemological constraints inherent to systems that privilege textual authority over critical evaluation. While we cannot definitively prove that these limitations are insurmountable, the evidence strongly suggests that current architectures face inherent barriers to genuine research capability. Yet understanding these limitations enables effective use despite constraints. Researchers who recognise these tools' technoscholastic nature can extract genuine value by carefully scoping tasks, maintaining rigorous human oversight, and working with rather than against each system's natural tendencies. Given this framework, the question becomes not whether AI can conduct autonomous research, but how to design systems and workflows that acknowledge these limitations while amplifying human research capabilities. This leads directly to our next section: if technoscholasticism constrains these tools, how do we build systems that compensate through architecture rather than expecting AI judgment that cannot exist?",

This temporality blindness manifested not merely as missing dates or failing to check timestamps, but as a complete absence of temporal reasoning capability. When examining the archaeological tool ArboDat, Deep Research overlooked the explicit statement on the homepage that ``it has been developed since 1997'' while conducting extensive searches elsewhere for chronological information. This selective blindness to readily available temporal data while pursuing tangential sources became a defining pattern. Claude Research demonstrated particularly revealing behaviour with version history. When directly instructed to focus on FAIMS with specific prompts about ``keeping the history and version straight,'' it successfully produced an accurate chronological account. However, when FAIMS appeared peripherally as context for other software, Claude described it as ``Android only''\u2014completely confusing past and future versions despite having previously demonstrated correct understanding. This inability to maintain temporal consistency across contexts suggests that these systems lack any genuine temporal model. Most fundamentally, the systems could not grasp that absence of recent evidence constitutes meaningful information. A Digital Humanities program showing no activity between 2020 and 2025 represents clear evidence of discontinuation to human researchers. The AI systems, however, treated any historical mention as perpetually valid, unable to infer from what we term ``useful absences.'' They operate in an eternal present where all textual claims exist simultaneously without temporal hierarchy or decay.",

Architectural constraints include significant technical limitations: bounded context windows\\footnote{Even with Gemini's million-token context windows, models will find certain aspects of certain content in the context windows salient. The more sources, especially presenting conflicting realities or representing multiple topics in the context window, the worse the performance. Conabulations increase, but worse, models lose the forest for the trees: there is no rank-order of text reliability or historiographical priority, instead the order is either in document presentation order or a function of the randomness inherent in text inference.}, single-threaded processing, absence of persistent state management, and the inability to move the token-cursor or edit/delete prior tokens once generated. Epistemic constraints encompass failures of judgment: refusing to recognise when task decomposition is inappropriate, declining to evaluate output quality against research goals, and lacking the impulse for self-critique. These categories interact perniciously. Architectural limitations prevent systems from implementing better epistemic practices even if they could recognise the need. The inability to revise or delete previous tokens means that even a system that recognised its own errors could not correct them. The ``no hands'' problem compounds these limitations further. Systems can engage only with text, never with reality, creating an insurmountable barrier to the kind of empirical verification that characterises genuine research. This architectural reality makes technoscholasticism not merely a tendency but an inevitability.\n\nThoughts? Is this well covered later or can it be incorporated into a later section?",

These categories interact perniciously. Architectural limitations prevent systems from implementing better epistemic practices even if they could recognise the need. The inability to revise or delete previous tokens means that even a system that recognised its own errors could not correct them. The \"no hands\" problem compounds these limitations further.

This architectural reality makes technoscholasticism not merely a tendency but an inevitability.\n\nThe key changes:\n- Added \"that privilege document order over historiographical priority\" to the first sentence\n- Added a new second sentence about expanded context windows\n- Shortened the footnote significantly while preserving the key technical observation",

            "content": "# Meta-Prompt for Section 6: Research Tool Design Requirements\n\n## Current Context\nWorking on \"An Absence of Judgment: AI's Limitations in Deep Research tasks\" with Brian Ballsun-Stanton and Shawn Ross. Just completed Section 5 (Reflective Analysis) which analysed patterns across AI research tools and provided practical recommendations for researchers.\n\n## Key Transition from Section 5\nSection 5 concluded: \"If technoscholasticism constrains these tools, how do we build systems that compensate through architecture rather than expecting AI judgment that cannot exist?\"\n\nSection 6 answers this by providing requirements for **developers** (not researchers) building next-generation research tools.\n\n## Critical Design Requirements from Transcripts\n\n### 1. Multi-Threaded Cognitive Architecture\n- **NOT** sub-research threads like Claude's current approach\n- Individual threads **per source** for clean context isolation\n- Each source evaluation thread operates in minimal context\n- Threads populate shared database (biblatex/sqlite) with evidence\n- Main context stays clean until sources validated and contextualised\n- Cross-thread communication through persistent artifacts, not context pollution\n\n### 2. Cursored To-Do Lists\n- Actively managed with human judgment checkpoints\n- Not waterfall but allows going back to revise research questions\n- User can see and modify the plan as research progresses\n- \"The idea of a waterfall model of research is laughable\"\n\n### 3. Document Store/Wiki Approach\n- Annotated bibliography outside context window\n- Markdown files committable to repositories\n- Store consulted (not just cited) works\n- Enable \"forgetting\" through explicit removal\n\n### 4. Tombstones\n- \"Indications of thoughts that we've had that are bad\"\n- Track explicitly rejected approaches\n- Prevent re-exploration of failed paths\n\n### 5. Stage-Based but Non-Waterfall\n- Literature finding, extraction, outline building, drafting, revision\n- Each stage has different context requirements\n- Support backwards movement and iteration\n\n### 6. Outline-Driven Context Management\n- \"When we get to that part of the outline, load the entire paper\"\n- Spin off focused sub-tasks with appropriate context\n\n### 7. Transparency Requirements\n- Show which sources considered at each step\n- Display quotes with page numbers\n- Document operationalisation of research questions\n\n## Human Integration Points (from transcripts)\n1. Initial search validation: \"Is this the kind of source you're looking for?\"\n2. Outline approval before drafting\n3. Precedent-setting through user choices\n4. Corrigibility during process (not just at start)\n\n## Section 6 Structure\n- 6.1: Introduction (bridge from limitations to design)\n- 6.2: Judgment-Aware Architecture (multi-threading, to-do lists, persistence, tombstones)\n- 6.3: Research Process Support (stages, context management, transparency)\n- 6.4: Human-AI Collaboration Framework (judgment points, corrigibility, tool philosophy)\n- 6.5: Evaluation Criteria (technical requirements, success metrics)\n- 6.6: Conclusion (honest tools that amplify rather than replace judgment)\n\n## Writing Approach\n- Write directly in LaTeX (no markdown intermediary)\n- Follow Australian academic English conventions\n- Break long sections into multiple paragraphs\n- Avoid quotes around our own thoughts/observations\n- Technical precision with accessibility\n- Concrete examples from Section 5 findings\n- 2-3 sentence units for clarity\n\n## Key Principles to Maintain\n1. These are requirements for **developers**, not usage tips for researchers\n2. Acknowledge technoscholasticism is inherent to LLM architecture\n3. Compensate through design rather than expecting AI judgment\n4. Focus on amplifying human judgment, not replacing it\n5. Transparency over sophistication\n\n## Specific Technical Points\n- Context window management isn't just about size but about saliency\n- Document order currently privileged over historiographical priority\n- Models can't rank source reliability or manage conflicts\n- Architecture and epistemology interact (can't fix what you can't recognise)\n\n## Remember\nThe goal is to provide concrete, implementable requirements that acknowledge AI limitations while enabling genuine research utility. These aren't aspirational features but necessary compensations for judgment absence.",
