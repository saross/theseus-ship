Despite its growing importance, humanities students\noften perceive AI as intimidating and inaccessible, while discourses\nsurrounding AI tend to focus disproportionately on technological utility\nor dystopian fears. This extended abstract presents findings from an\nethnographic study conducted on a university seminar that introduced\nundergraduate humanities students to Large Language Models (LLMs).\nGuided by the principles of \\\"engagement philosophy,\\\" which emphasises\nparticipatory and co-constructed learning, the seminar's experiential\nlearning approach transformed students\\' technical competencies, ethical\nconsciousness, and dispositions toward AI---collectively described here\nas their \\\"digital habitus\\\".\n\nThis research responds to two critical questions:\n\n1.  How did the seminar transform students' attitudes, perceptions, and\n    > skills regarding AI?\n\n2.  What pedagogical factors contributed to these transformations, and\n    > what implications do they have for humanities-based AI education?\n\nThrough qualitative and evidence-based insights, this study highlights\nthe importance of equipping humanities students with both technical\nproficiency and ethical sensitivity, enabling them to engage\nmeaningfully with AI\\'s societal implications.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe findings presented in this abstract are based on a qualitative,\nethnographic study examining the transformative impact of a university\nseminar on humanities students' understanding of Artificial Intelligence\n(AI). The research employed a combination of participant observation,\nsemi-structured interviews, and reflective journaling to collect\nreal-time data on students' evolving skills, attitudes, and perceptions.\nAs the researcher, I attended all seminar sessions, taking detailed\nfield notes on classroom interactions, group activities, and informal\npeer exchanges (e.g., social media discussions) that contributed to the\nstudents' learning experiences.\n\nTo capture individual perspectives, I conducted semi-structured\ninterviews with students at key points during the semester---early, mid,\nand post-course---focusing on their experiences with AI tools, their\nreflections on ethical challenges, and their broader views on\ntechnology. These varied data sources were triangulated to ensure a\ncomprehensive understanding of the seminar's pedagogical impact.\n\nThis research adhered strictly to ethical guidelines for qualitative\nstudies. All participants provided verbal consent to be observed and\ninterviewed. Names and identifying details were anonymized in research\nnotes, interviews, and subsequent analyses. Particular care was taken to\navoid exposing sensitive information shared during in-class discussions\nor personal reflections.\n\n## **[Transforming Students\\' Attitudes, Perceptions, and Skills]{.underline}**\n\n## **1. [Technical Competencies]{.underline}**\n\nPrior to the seminar, students were largely intimidated by AI,\nperceiving it as a \\\"black box\\\" accessible only to experts. However,\nthrough hands-on interaction with LLMs, students developed technical\nskills enabling them to operate AI tools effectively. For instance,\nZoe's transition from describing herself as an \\\"imposter\\\" to\nconfidently programming system prompts for her legal studies exemplifies\nthis evolution; by the end of the seminar, Zoe shared \"*When I was able\nto program the system prompt to fit my unit guidelines just so I could\nask it general questions and get it to extract sections of legislation,\nthat was like, wow, this could be super helpful.\"*[^1] Similarly, Zeke,\na high school teacher, began using LLMs to design rubrics and\nassignments, transforming his perception of AI from a threat to a\ncollaborative tool. The seminar's experiential approach fostered this\nshift by encouraging students to \\\"play around\\\" with LLMs, reducing\nanxiety and promoting active experimentation.\n\n## **2. [Ethical Consciousness]{.underline}**\n\nThe seminar also nurtured students\\' ability to critically evaluate AI\noutputs for biases, inaccuracies, and confabulations. For example, a\nstudent-led \\\"fatphobia experiment\\\" unveiled systemic biases in AI\ntraining data, which sparked a class-wide dialogue on the dangers of\nuncritical AI use. Similarly, Molly, drawing on her experience as a\nparalegal, critiqued the potential consequences of AI confabulations in\nlegal contexts. When discussing a recent seminar assignment during an\ninterview, Zeke shared: \"*When we did the simulation, and someone read\nout their response and the AI had made it really racist, and the way\nthat the AI really manipulated, well, more like driven by bias to craft\nthat was shocking. I'd be interested to see where the AI gets its racist\nstereotypes from.\"*[^2] These moments of discovery underscore how\nethical awareness develops through collaborative reflection, contextual\nrelevance, and hands-on use.\n\n## **3. [Transformations in Attitudes]{.underline}**\n\nBy semester's end, students exhibited a profound shift in their\nattitudes toward AI---from fear and distrust to curiosity and critical\nengagement. Students viewed AI as an assistant rather than as a\nreplacement for human thought. In Molly's words: *\"This class has\nactually been reassuring that AI is way more stupid than people think it\nis.\"*[^3] This change aligns with engagement philosophy\\'s emphasis on\nrepositioning learners as agents of meaning-making in their relationship\nwith technology.\n\n## **[Pedagogical Factors Facilitating Transformation]{.underline}**\n\n## **1. [Experiential Learning]{.underline}**\n\nThe seminar\\'s pedagogy emphasized active engagement, with students\nusing LLMs for simulations, problem-solving tasks, and collaborative\nexperiments. For example, students simulated Cold War debates by\nprogramming AI to adopt historically accurate ideological biases,\ndeepening their understanding of both AI\\'s contextual limitations and\nits potential for creative applications in a way that was both engaging\nand relevant to their humanities degrees.\n\n## **2. [Collaborative Exploration]{.underline}**\n\nA central pillar of the seminar was its emphasis on fostering spaces for\ncollective meaning-making. Collaborative learning was not an incidental\nbyproduct but an intentional design encompassing engaging class\nassignments, reflective discussions, and informal group dynamics. These\nspaces empowered students to think critically and creatively together,\nwith educators acting as facilitators rather than lecturers. Such\ncollaborative exploration extended beyond the physical classroom,\npermeating informal digital interactions, such as group chats, and\nbecoming a significant site of sustained engagement.\n\n## **3. [Reflection and Meaning-Making]{.underline}**\n\nReflective exercises, such as class discussions and individual\nassignments, allowed students to connect their technical learnings to\nbroader societal and ethical implications. For instance, a classroom\nexchange on AI-generated racist stereotypes prompted students to reflect\ndeeply on biases in data training and their implications for societal\nequity: *\"The fact that an initial conversation on AI naturally drifts\nto more existential concerns\\... speaks volumes about how we make sense\nof this technology.\"*[^4]\n\n## **[Broader Implications for AI Pedagogy and the Humanities]{.underline}**\n\nThis study underscores the importance of incorporating experiential,\ncollaborative, and reflective pedagogies into AI education for\nhumanities students. By bridging technical literacy with ethical\nsensitivity, such approaches empower students to engage critically with\nAI's societal applications, counteracting passive consumption or\nuncritical acceptance.\n\nFurthermore, this research highlights how humanities students' unique\nskills---such as contextual analysis, ethical reasoning, and critical\nthinking---position them to lead nuanced debates on AI governance, data\nethics, and public policy. The findings advocate for institutional\nsupport in designing interdisciplinary AI curricula that address both\ntechnical and philosophical dimensions.\n\n## **[Conclusion]{.underline}**\n\nThe seminar's transformative impact on students' \\\"digital habitus\\\"\ndemonstrates the potential of engagement philosophy in AI education. By\nfostering technical competencies and ethical awareness through\nexperiential learning, collaborative exploration, and critical\nreflection, the course empowered students to move beyond fear and\nutility, engaging with AI as responsible and informed citizens.\n\nAs AI becomes increasingly pervasive, equipping humanities students with\nthese skills is not only essential for their academic and professional\nsuccess but also for ensuring that societal conversations around AI\nremain inclusive, critical, and ethically grounded. This study thus\noffers a model for rethinking AI pedagogy in ways that center human\nagency and collective meaning-making.\n\n[^1]: Excerpt from my fieldnotes, August 20, 2024.\n\n[^2]: Ibid, September 29, 2024.\n\n[^3]: Excerpt from my fieldnotes, October 5, 2024.\n\n[^4]: Ibid, August 7, 2024.\n"

Key pedagogical factors included hands-on exploration, collaborative meaning-making, and reflective practice. Findings suggest humanities students bring valuable critical thinking and ethical reasoning to AI discourse.
