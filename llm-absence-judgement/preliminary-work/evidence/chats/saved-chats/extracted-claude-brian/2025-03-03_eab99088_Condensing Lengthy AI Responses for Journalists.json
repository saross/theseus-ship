But I'll toss this whole thing through Claude 3.7 to see what I can do for \"shorter\" at the end.\n\nBasically, Angie wants a guide to recent AI developments that explains\nin simple terms what these programs/apps do, why you should try them\nand what is good or bad for them.\n\nI hope this is OK. I think a lot can be cut and paste from the\ndocument you sent Angie, but I want to be sure I'm on the right track.\n\nMany thanks\nAndrew\n\nNo worries. We just need to calibrate on \"simple.\" This is why I liked Mauricio's \"fast fashion\" framing that we could hang the article around.\n\n\nCould you please answer these questions by Tue Mar 4 12midday (let me\nknow if you need more time). I will then draft the story (around 500\nwords) and send it to you to review.\n\n1) Intro - Rapid development of AI\n- Why are different types of AI in development?\nThe last three months have been incredibly novel in terms of AI. \n\nWe have had \"reasoning\" models, where a model tries to figure out what you mean before giving you an answer. The best example of this is OpenAI's o1, where it tries with some success to figure out an answer first. The actual research here is: \"If we allow an AI extra time to come up with a response to a human, usually the response is of higher quality.\" (People also enjoy observing the \"thinking\" of the models.)\nWe have had \"Deep Research\" modes come out from Google, OpenAI, Perplexity, and HuggingFace, where the tool uses \"reasoning\" to figure out what to search for, then compiles sources together into a response. \nWe have had OpenAI and Anthropic release \"agentic\" (agent-like) demonstrations, \"Operator\" and \"Computer Use\" respectively, that can use a web browser on the user's behalf. These are early days yet, but with these and deep research --  the vibe is: \"pay attention to much the world changed between October 2022 and March 2023. It feels like we're on the edge of the same kind of change.\" \nWe've had the HighFlyer funded company DeepSeek release multiple Chinese-focused models, v3 (normal), r1 (reasoning), and then bundle r1 into an app called \"DeepSeek\" \u2014 which is a horrible mess of security holes. The notable engineering innovation they've demonstrated is how cheap it can be (so long as you don't count any CapEx or OpEx as part of the number you're publishing) to train models. \nWe have had notable capability increases in the state-of-the-art models by OpenAI and Anthropic. o1-pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, represent much more capable, erudite, and thoughtful models than those used to their work-provided copilot or a brief flirtation with GPT-3.5 last year.\n\n- Why should readers be interested? How will it affect their lives -\npersonally and professionally?\nAnthropic's Claude.ai frontend and OpenAI's ChatGPT frontend offer remarkably affordable access to these new capabilities and models. The most fundamental impact is solving the \"blank page problem\" \u2014 when readers are faced with a task, some document they need to produce, and don't have the motivation to get started, Claude 3.7 and OpenAI's o1 can take the user's rambling thoughts (try just talking to it, both apps have some kind of dictation or voice support) plus the structure of the document, and turn it into a quite persuasive first draft. \n\nOn the other side of things, these two services can take an unpolished first draft (by a human) and help to serve as editors, either pointing out problems or suggesting fixes. These, however, are not spellcheckers. They do best when looking at problems throughout a multipage document. In a recent paper, Claude 3.7 Sonnet reminded me that I was talking about a concept a page before I introduced it. Part of the prompt I use for this is:\n\n\"Proceed *slowly* and *thoughtfully* paragraph by paragraph. We need to double-check that each paragraph is not only merely \"grammatically correct\" but that it has appropriate flow and academic use of speech. Beyond that, we also need to do a \"thinko\" check as well as the \"typo\" check -- identifying places where we use terms or jargon before we describe them, or places that should have citations but do not. \"\n\nSo, for professional use, where people want to ensure their documents are clear and have good flow, these tools are great. \n\nPersonally, besides taking photos of my spices and pantry and trying to figure out what unanticipated dishes I can make from them (I can share the log from the weekend if you want to have examples) it can be great as a way of \"breaking down the arguments\" of a text (maybe a news story, maybe a paper).\n\nIf I use (as an excerpt):\nHi Claude. \"Given: break down the argumentation and techniques in the following passage: what claims do we make, how do we support them, what conclusions do we make from those claims? Use the Toulmin Argument model for this. I would like you to engage in proleptic reasoning for each of these claims and assert counterarguments that could be made. Make this a diagram for me.\"\nand paste in, for example...  an article from The Lighthouse, produces: https://claude.ai/share/ddb59a58-107d-40c1-acd8-12c365b5c480 (We'd need to work on the graph a bit), but it's a way of looking at incoming news stories shorn of their rhetoric.\n\nIn short: Anthropic's Claude 3.7 and OpenAI's o1 (via claude.ai and chatgpt.com respectively) are fantastic tools for transforming text. If we can give them enough of our ideas and an expectation of how to combine, fold, spindle, and mutilate them, then they can output them in a format of our choice. It's a great way of cutting down on silly and intimidating busywork, or a great way to start if you have ideas but no idea what to do with them. (So long as you exhibit judgement and remember that you, the human, own the consequences of your prompting/judgement.)\n\nFundamentally: the ability of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and o1-pro to manipulate text is astonishing. If you have a task, set out the task and then prompt it with your goal and \"What I would like you to do is to ask me a series of questions, one at a time, until you believe you have sufficient information to\" ... do the thing. \n\n- Why are you interested in these developments? How do you use AI in\nyour work and personal life?\n\nPersonal life:\nAs a mirror for my thoughts \u2014 I use it for recipe-ideas, story writing, and sense checking. It takes the tacit information in my prompts and gives it back to me in a different way.\nTo take my voice ramblings and turn them into structured outlines or notes.\nStorytelling (Though this is mostly me using story telling as a means of testing each model's erudition, soooo, the lines blur) \nProfessional life:\nTo transform text \u2014 to take my ideas and turn them into a different form\nTo make small programs \u2014 to take my ideas and operationalise them into code that I can then check\nTo transform audio \u2014 take audio and use Whisper to turn them into transcripts that I can then apply in step 1\nTo brainstorm and work on structure\nTo copy-edit and work on clarity\nTo vibe check and check how other professional literatures interact with my ideas\n\n2. Five main types of AI\n- Google's Gemini updates\n- Open AI\n- Chat GPT\n- Claude\n- Deep Seek\n\nFor each of these AI's could you please answer these questions\n- What do they do?\n- Why should you try them?\n- What is useful, not useful about them?\n\nIncorrect. Here is the partial list for text inference models.\nOpenAI's models\nGPT-4o\no1-pro\no3-mini-high\nGPT-4.5\nAnthropic's models\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking)\nGoogle's models\nGemini 2.0 Pro\nGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking \nDeepSeek's models\nDeepSeek R1\nDeepSeek V3\nPerplexity's \"models\" (since you wanted 5 companies)\nr1-1776\n(I'm ignoring Twitter's models because f that guy and they're not incredibly interesting.)\n\nOk, so I'm going to use OpenAI's Deep Research (and using GPT-4.5 to give a first draft of the above, because there are an awful lot of models that you just asked about. I don't love its outputs, but it gives you a sense of what media is saying about all these models.\n\n\nFirst, above all else, the \"interface\" is not the \"model\"\n\nChatGPT, the service, allows us to use any of OpenAI's products. It also gives us access to Deep Research (great for a summary descriptive lit review) and Operator (great to see a computer failing to use a website very well)\nClaude.ai, the service, allows us to use any of Anthropic's products (but we just use Claude 3.7 Sonnet)\nGoogle has its interfaces (though I just use the aistudio dashboard to try out its models) and look at Gemini Flash running on my android via \"Hey Google\"\nDeepSeek runs the \"DeepSeek app\" with all of its security problems (just look on Ars Technica and Krebs on Security, they're woeful) and I'm pretty sure runs R1 via it. (I've not loaded the app on my devices)\nPerplexity's R1-1776 is political posturing and I don't really care if it's available through perplexity.ai.\n\nThe fundamental thing is: NEVER EVER USE THE FREE VERSION OF ANY OF THESE. It is hobbled, you should have no expectation of privacy, and does not give you a good sense of the capabilities of the thing.\n\nThe second fundamental thing: If you have not spent 10 hours playing with a GOOD paid model, you have no idea what's going on. (To nod towards Ethan Mollick.) Feel free to ask these models how to prompt themselves.\n\nThe interface is the thing which allows us to write words at one of these models (which we can select) and get words back (\"text inference\"). It changes what we can do, and some of the guardrails of the thing.\n\nNow, models, in brief.\n\nOpenAI's models\nGPT-4o\nWhat do they do? Flat \"waffle\" \u2014 generic cheap bolding and italics, lacking all substance. What we see when we get \"bad\" AI writing (with concomitant bad prompting)\nWhy should you try them? \u2014 It's usually what's given as the \"free\" version of things. You'll be forced to try this. Don't seek it out.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? \u2014 It's cheap. \no1-pro\nWhat do they do? \u2014 \"Reasoning\" It can \"think through\" problems and we can see its \"inner monologue\" It's not bad at problem solving in a limited sense.\nWhy should you try them? \u2014 I quite like it for copy editing and argumentation breakdowns. Good computer vision capabilities as well.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? \u2014 It can work out a very detailed plan from not a lot of prompting. It tends to go off on its own and isn't great for instruction following.\no3-mini-high\nWhat do they do? \u2014 the latest and greatest (fast, cheap) version of \"o3\" \u2014 a model breaking both the bank and many of the \"how good is this?\" evaluations. o3 is not yet available to the public, but it \"thinks real good.\" o3-mini-high can be quite capable when coding.\nWhy should you try them? \u2014 Right now, don't bother. The $20/month plan has very limited uses, and it's not enough to play with. Keep an eye out for things running \"o3\" though, as they'll end up being quite powerful when the price comes down.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? Very good at \"reasoning\" but not great at erudition or instruciton following.\nGPT-4.5\nWhat do they do? Cost a lot. The latest (And some say final) update to GPT-4. Apparently quite good for \"aesthetic\" writing, though I personally prefer Claude 3.7 Sonnet more.\nWhy should you try them? Don't. Not worth $200/mo.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? Still working that out. This came out last week.\nAnthropic's models\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet\nWhat do they do? \u2014 Great at sounding humane, being sympathetic, manipulating worfds\nWhy should you try them? \u2014 Because you want the most mundane utility at a reasonable price.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? Useful: It's great at figuring out what I'm asking for, being as critical as I want it to be, and being as sympathetic as I want it to be. Not useful: Mostly this is the interface, but claude.ai's rate limits, even for paying customers, is frustrating.\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking)\nWhat do they do? \u2014 Excellent at code and at integrating multiple pdfs that I upload\nWhy should you try them? \u2014 because you need good solid text and only have some ideas and structure to work off of. Also, good at dealing with photos and uploaded documents.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? \u2014 Great at code and structure, not great at how non-introspective the thinking is. (It looks like it just calls 3.7 again, rather than having an \"I wonder\" ... \"But what about?\" stage.\nRight now, in March, people should be using claude.ai as their \"Daily driver\" LLMs. \nGoogle's models\nGemini 2.0 Pro\nWhat do they do? \u2014 Google's latest release, decent at words, you can fit a lot of information in.\nWhy should you try them? \u2014 Becuase aistudio makes it free to try, and if you need free access to a decent AI, this is... fine? (note privacy problems)\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? Good at images and video processing into text. Language is kind of clunky.\nGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking \nWhat do they do? Google's go at a \"thinking\" model.\nWhy should you try them? In case you want to see what this \"reasoning\" thing is all about and don't want to spend money. It will be somewhat underwhelming.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? It's freeish. \nDeepSeek's models\nDeepSeek R1\nWhat do they do? The first release of a \"reasoning\" model that showed its thinking. A really interesting engineering exercise in getting the most capability out of some fairly old chips. Answer questions according to the CCP party line.\nWhy should you try them? DO NOT.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? DO NOT. Security and epistemic nightmare.\nDeepSeek V3\nWhat do they do? DeepSeek's first release that put them on my map. Quite solid release for a non-reasoning model.\nWhy should you try them? DO NOT.\nWhat is useful, not useful about them? DO NOT.\n\nRight. I'm tired. I'm going to skip perplexity's model. Perplexity.ai is interesting because, if you pay for it, you can use Anthropic's Claude 3.7 while having a fairly decent web-search as well, so that the AI can look over your search results and work with them for facts. \n\n3. Conclusion: Looking ahead\n- Will AI continue to evolve? Will it improve? Become cheaper?\n\nYes. To quote Zvi Moshowitz: \"As we always say, this is the worst the tool will ever be, and you are the worst you will ever be at knowing how to use it.\" New models come out every 6-8 weeks, most are ignorable. Sam Altman said: \"The cost to use a given level of AI falls about 10x every 12 months, and lower prices lead to much more use\" \u2014 capabilities at a given subscription are getting better at a rate that I find almost impossible to keep up with, and it's my job to be able to tell my colleagues across the university how to understand and how to prompt these things. \n\nThese things, however, will become better and will become faster at the same price point. If you want cheaper and more private, you'll need to use the pay-per-use versions (Anthropic's Dashboard, OpenAI's Platform). These are much cheaper and much more private, but a little less user friendly to use.\n\nHowever, all of the above pales in comparison to basic philosophy of technology. A technology is a tool plus a technique to achieve a desired outcome. These tools, to quote Zvi, are as bad as they will ever be. Our techniques are as bad as they will ever be. Our understanding for how to prompt these \"textual technologies\" (Breen) has barely advanced beyond \"maybe don't treat it like a search engine?\" Our ability to get what we say we want out of these things has barely gotten off the ground. And with the innovations of the last 3 months, this year is going to look a lot like 2023 where the rate of change in AI is concerned. \n\n- Are you concerned about AI having a negative impact? ie. will it\nwipe out white collar jobs?\nYes. It is going to transform academia and knowledge work \u2014 and that is going to cause massive disruption to what we expect our jobs to be, what we do, and how many of us are employed (much less happy/alive/social). Any period of \"revolutionary science\" (to nod to Kuhn) is profoundly disruptive, as what we thought we knew is called into question. This is the best possible outcome assuming that all development stops today and presumes the fundamental capabilities of these things will not improve beyond incrementally. All of this presumes that these things merely transform text. I'm not going to speculate on how many jobs will be \"wiped out\" \u2014 but many will be transformed, and those who don't understand how to engage with these textual technologies for mundane utility will not have a happy time of things. \n\nI can point you to the further literature on risks and impacts.\n\n- What do you want from AI?\nTo be able to have enough of a clue to say: \"Hold on, let me try that again, this doesn't seem right. I need to delete a few things.\" \u2014 I do not believe the current technologies will be able to do this without a major new innovation.\n\n\n\nAnd here's Claude 3.7 Thinking compressing all the above down.\n"

Here are the concise versions:\n\n## 1) Intro - Rapid development of AI\n\n**Why are different types of AI in development?**\nRecent months have seen breakthroughs in \"reasoning\" models (like OpenAI's o1) that think before answering, \"Deep Research\" tools that compile sources, and \"agentic\" systems (like Operator and Computer Use) that can use web browsers on users' behalf. These advances, alongside more capable models from OpenAI and Anthropic, represent a potential transformation similar to what we saw between late 2022 and early 2023.\n\n**Why should readers be interested? How will it affect their lives?**\nModern AI tools like Claude 3.7 and o1 solve the \"blank page problem\" by transforming rough ideas into polished first drafts, while also serving as sophisticated editors for existing work. For personal use, they can generate recipes from available ingredients or break down complex arguments in news articles, making them powerful text transformation tools for both professional documents and everyday tasks.\n\n**How do you use AI in your work and personal life?**\nPersonally, I use AI as a mirror for my thoughts, for recipe ideas, story writing, and to transform voice ramblings into structured content. Professionally, I use it to transform text into different forms, create small programs, convert audio to transcripts, brainstorm, copy-edit, and check how my ideas interact with other professional literature.\n\n## 2. Main AI models\n\n**Note on interfaces vs models:**\nThe interface (like ChatGPT or Claude.ai) is not the model itself but rather the service allowing you to interact with various AI models. Always use paid versions for better capabilities and privacy, and spend significant time exploring good paid models to understand their potential.\n\n**OpenAI's key models:**\nGPT-4o offers generic output but is commonly available for free; o1-pro excels at \"reasoning\" with visible \"inner monologue\" and is good for editing; o3-mini-high is fast and capable with coding; while GPT-4.5 is their latest premium update, reportedly good for aesthetic writing but very expensive at $200/month.\n\n**Anthropic's models:**\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet excels at sounding human, manipulating text effectively, and understanding intent, while its \"Thinking\" mode is excellent for code and integrating multiple documents. Currently, Claude.ai offers the best balance of capability and value as a \"daily driver\" AI.\n\n**Google's models:**\nGemini 2.0 Pro processes lots of information and excels with images and video, while Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking offers free access to reasoning capabilities, though both have somewhat clunky language and privacy concerns.\n\n**DeepSeek's models:**\nWhile technically interesting, DeepSeek's models should be avoided due to serious security concerns and alignment with CCP viewpoints.\n\n## 3. Conclusion: Looking ahead\n\n**Will AI continue to evolve and become cheaper?**\nYes, with new models appearing every 6-8 weeks and capabilities at given price points consistently improving, while costs for a given level of AI fall roughly 10x every 12 months according to Sam Altman. However, our techniques and understanding for effectively prompting these \"textual technologies\" are still in their infancy.\n\n**Are you concerned about AI having negative impacts on jobs?**\nYes, AI will transform academia and knowledge work, causing significant disruption to job expectations and employment patterns. While I won't speculate on how many jobs will disappear, many will be transformed, and those who don't learn to engage with these technologies effectively will struggle.\n\n**What do you want from AI?**\nI want AI to develop enough self-awareness to recognize when something isn't right and say, \"Hold on, let me try that again\" \u2013 though this likely requires major new innovations beyond current technologies.",

Five main types of AI\n\nThe journalist incorrectly listed five types, but the person provided a more detailed breakdown of various models from different companies:\n\n**OpenAI's models**\n- GPT-4o\n- o1-pro\n- o3-mini-high\n- GPT-4.5\n\n**Anthropic's models**\n- Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking)\n\n**Google's models**\n- Gemini 2.0 Pro\n- Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking\n\n**DeepSeek's models**\n- DeepSeek R1\n- DeepSeek V3\n\nFor each model, the person provided information on what they do, why you should try them, and what is useful/not useful about them.\n\nI'll condense these into 1-2 sentence descriptions for each model or company's suite of models, focusing on key differentiators and practical uses.\n\n### 3. Conclusion: Looking ahead\n\n- **Will AI continue to evolve? Will it improve? Become cheaper?**\n\nCurrent response confirms it will evolve, quotes Zvi Moshowitz about the tools improving and users getting better at using them, mentions Sam Altman's statement about costs falling, and discusses the philosophy of technology.\n\nI'll condense this to focus on the projected improvement trajectory and cost trends.\n\n- **Are you concerned about AI having a negative impact? ie. will it wipe out white collar jobs?**\n\nCurrent response expresses concern about transformation of academia and knowledge work, mentions \"revolutionary science\" causing disruption, and avoids speculating on specific job losses but notes many will be transformed.\n\nI'll condense this to acknowledge concerns while providing a balanced perspective.\n\n- **What do you want from AI?**\n\nCurrent response is brief and mentions wanting AI to have enough self-awareness to recognize when something isn't right and try again.\n\nThis is already fairly concise, but I can tighten it further.\n\nNow I'll create 1-2 sentence condensed answers for each question.",

Here are the concise versions:\n\n## 1) Intro - Rapid development of AI\n\n**Why are different types of AI in development?**\nRecent months have seen breakthroughs in \"reasoning\" models (like OpenAI's o1) that think before answering, \"Deep Research\" tools that compile sources, and \"agentic\" systems (like Operator and Computer Use) that can use web browsers on users' behalf. These advances, alongside more capable models from OpenAI and Anthropic, represent a potential transformation similar to what we saw between late 2022 and early 2023.\n\n**Why should readers be interested? How will it affect their lives?**\nModern AI tools like Claude 3.7 and o1 solve the \"blank page problem\" by transforming rough ideas into polished first drafts, while also serving as sophisticated editors for existing work. For personal use, they can generate recipes from available ingredients or break down complex arguments in news articles, making them powerful text transformation tools for both professional documents and everyday tasks.\n\n**How do you use AI in your work and personal life?**\nPersonally, I use AI as a mirror for my thoughts, for recipe ideas, story writing, and to transform voice ramblings into structured content. Professionally, I use it to transform text into different forms, create small programs, convert audio to transcripts, brainstorm, copy-edit, and check how my ideas interact with other professional literature.\n\n## 2. Main AI models\n\n**Note on interfaces vs models:**\nThe interface (like ChatGPT or Claude.ai) is not the model itself but rather the service allowing you to interact with various AI models. Always use paid versions for better capabilities and privacy, and spend significant time exploring good paid models to understand their potential.\n\n**OpenAI's key models:**\nGPT-4o offers generic output but is commonly available for free; o1-pro excels at \"reasoning\" with visible \"inner monologue\" and is good for editing; o3-mini-high is fast and capable with coding; while GPT-4.5 is their latest premium update, reportedly good for aesthetic writing but very expensive at $200/month.\n\n**Anthropic's models:**\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet excels at sounding human, manipulating text effectively, and understanding intent, while its \"Thinking\" mode is excellent for code and integrating multiple documents. Currently, Claude.ai offers the best balance of capability and value as a \"daily driver\" AI.\n\n**Google's models:**\nGemini 2.0 Pro processes lots of information and excels with images and video, while Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking offers free access to reasoning capabilities, though both have somewhat clunky language and privacy concerns.\n\n**DeepSeek's models:**\nWhile technically interesting, DeepSeek's models should be avoided due to serious security concerns and alignment with CCP viewpoints.\n\n## 3. Conclusion: Looking ahead\n\n**Will AI continue to evolve and become cheaper?**\nYes, with new models appearing every 6-8 weeks and capabilities at given price points consistently improving, while costs for a given level of AI fall roughly 10x every 12 months according to Sam Altman. However, our techniques and understanding for effectively prompting these \"textual technologies\" are still in their infancy.\n\n**Are you concerned about AI having negative impacts on jobs?**\nYes, AI will transform academia and knowledge work, causing significant disruption to job expectations and employment patterns. While I won't speculate on how many jobs will disappear, many will be transformed, and those who don't learn to engage with these technologies effectively will struggle.\n\n**What do you want from AI?**\nI want AI to develop enough self-awareness to recognize when something isn't right and say, \"Hold on, let me try that again\" \u2013 though this likely requires major new innovations beyond current technologies.",
