Contra \\textcite{kwon_is_2025}, this is not a question of ``first drafts'' by AI, nor even writing sections, but trying to figure out how to find ``mundane utility'' in these tools.\n\nWe found mundane utility in an iterative auto-interview technique. In short, for each stage of the paper, getting the best frontier models to ask us one specific question at a time for each component under development. Fundamentally, we believe that this technique allows us to lower cognitive load while allowing our own thoughts to be legibly represented: we could answer the AI's questions while in transit or in brief conversations, rather than trying to dedicate whole days to the writing process. \n\nWe believe this is a question of agumentation, not automation. The AI served as tool, breaking down each task of composition and ideation into smaller chunks, allowing us to document and reflect on our engagement with AI as we were performing the research.\n\nFor initial ideation and outlining, we used GPT 4.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet in thinking mode. The key prompt was loading in transcripts of prior conversations and to give it first, the ``goal'' of:\n\\begin{quote}\n    I'd like us to work through getting a complete structure into \"An Absence of Judgement\" (which is what the autoethno paper has become) so that we have LaTeX comments in a section by section design, for a paper suitable for the journal ... (author guidelines attached)\n\nMy intention is that we get a 1250 word outline for this 5000 word paper. The outline should have no sentences, but recurse down to the subparagraph level. (We'll also figure out where we need more evidence and I'll go find my hypothes.is annotations)\n\n(It's ok if we build out the outline breadth-wise as well. We need to take this very slowly step by step. I've info-dumped over a few weeks and this is the opportunity for you to help me get my head in order, especially as I've not touched it for a week.)\n\nWe're planning a 5k word journal article, and I'm experimenting with how to do this via reflection from you instead of the \"just sit down and write\" style.\n\nBefore we begin, give me a readback, and ask me any ANY questions you have about the process or context.\n\\end{quote}\n\nEffective conversations here always start with a goal, and end with the specific transformation of text desired as the immediate response by AI. Asking for a functional decomposition and/or readback (as the complexity of task dictates) is useful as it provides both scaffolding to the AI and an easy falsification to ensure that any tacit assumptions by the user in the prompt are surfaced quickly, such that the chat can be restarted if necessary.\n\nOnce the context of the research has been established and the user has validated that all salient inputs are reflected in the readback, prompting the AI to: ``Ask me one specific, pointed, academic question at a time until you are satisfied you are able to do [task]'' allows for the process of auto-interviewing to begin. To be clear, this process is not \\textit{faster} than normal academic writing. Instead, it is more easily decomposed, so to find times in the margins of the workday. An example question the AI asked when outlining was: \n\\begin{quote}\n    For 1.1 Problem Statement: Would you like to incorporate specific examples of AI systems claiming \"agentic\" capabilities for research? I noticed in your transcripts you mentioned OpenAI's Deep Research and marketing language around agency - is this the primary target of critique, or are there others?\n\\end{quote}\nAlmost all of the AI's questions demand at least a multi-paragraph response, and when dictating, a 5-20 minute response. \n\nThe cruicial thing is to build this approach with maximum context at all times. We transcribed all conversations (using Whisper and Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental) and ensured that they were in our version control and in Overleaf in a ``transcripts.tex'' file. Then, in the Claude.ai project, we could synchronise those transcripts using GitHub. Trying to go too quickly with this, with not enough context, will result in a loss of information. Each step must be maximally scaffolded. \n\nWith Gemini Pro 2.5 Experimental, when transcribing using aistudio.google.com, we used variations on the following system prompt:\n\\begin{quote}\nPlease faithfully transcribe these audio notes by a philosopher, discussing questions put to them about a paper outline. The user input will be the questions and an audio file. The first user input will be the context of discussion (the abstract and paper outline). Only transcribe exactly what you here. If things are unclear, annotate possible transcriptions with [] and their phonetic representation.     \n\\end{quote}\n\nAnd, once we had an outline, when getting auto-interview questions to work on the paper subsection by subsection, we posed the same prompt to GPT 4.5, o3, Claude 3.7, and Gemini 2.5. This approach was shockingly useful, as we combined \\textit{all} answers to a round of questions and returned the set of 1-4 answers to all participating models. Each model had its own focus, and the juxtaposition of questions and answers from each round, we believe, provided better and more varied context by model. \n\nOnce composed, of course, an extremely thorough editing was necessary---not so much to reduce errors, though there were a few, but to de-duplicate concepts and statements. However, all prompts and transcript logs are published on OSF at \n%TODO URL\n, and can be inspected. \n\nBy requiring the AI to ask us one pointed question at a time, and recording either a monologue or dialogue in response, it allowed us to focus on very specific responses to parts of a quite large paper.

We detail this approach for transparency and potential adaptation by other researchers.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe employed an iterative autointerviewing technique using frontier LLMs to decompose the writing process into manageable components. This approach generated 32,772 words of transcript material (including prompts and responses) to produce the initial 14,000-word draft. Rather than accelerating composition, this method enabled work in the margins of standard academic schedules by breaking cognitive tasks into discrete, bounded segments.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n### Model Selection and Configuration\nWe used GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet for initial ideation and outlining. For section development, we employed parallel questioning across GPT-4.5, o3, Claude 3.7, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, combining their varied questioning approaches to generate comprehensive coverage of each topic.\n\n### Prompt Structure\nEach session began with explicit goal-setting and context establishment:\n```\nI'd like us to work through getting a complete structure into \"An Absence of Judgement\"... \n[specific transformation desired]\nBefore we begin, give me a readback, and ask me any ANY questions you have about the process or context.\n```\n\nFollowing validation of the readback, we prompted: \"Ask me one specific, pointed, academic question at a time until you are satisfied you are able to [task].\"\n\n### Process Workflow\n1. **Transcription**: All responses were audio-recorded and transcribed using Whisper and Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental\n2. **Version Control**: Transcripts maintained in Git and synchronised to Claude.ai projects via GitHub\n3. **Question Density**: Models typically generated 5-10 questions per section or subsection\n4. **Response Integration**: Answers combined across models for subsequent rounds\n\n## Practical Outcomes\n\n### Effectiveness\nThe method proved most valuable for:\n- Surfacing implicit assumptions requiring clarification\n- Maintaining consistent analytical depth across sections\n- Enabling composition during transit or between other commitments\n\n### Limitations\n- No time savings compared to traditional composition\n- Required extensive post-composition editing for redundancy\n- Some models (particularly o3) occasionally pursued unproductive tangents\n- Questions primarily followed deductive patterns from existing content\n\n## Documentation and Reproducibility\n\nAll prompts, transcripts, and iteration logs are available at [OSF URL]. The complete workflow demonstrates how bounded AI assistance can support academic writing while maintaining human judgment at all critical junctures\u2014a practical instantiation of the paper's theoretical arguments about appropriate human-AI collaboration boundaries.",
