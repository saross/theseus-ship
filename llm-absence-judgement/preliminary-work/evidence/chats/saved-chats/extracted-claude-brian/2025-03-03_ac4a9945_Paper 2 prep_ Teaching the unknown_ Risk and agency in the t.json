Contributors will document:\n\nSuccessful methodologies for teaching AI literacy\nCritical evaluations of different pedagogical approaches\nPhenomenological accounts of student-AI interaction\nFrameworks for ethical implementation of AI in educational settings\nEvidence-based recommendations for institutional adoption\nAccepted contributors should expect to submit their full papers to an edited volume within three months after the conference.\n\nFormat and Timeline:\nWe propose a full-day symposium structured around experiential learning and collaborative analysis. The morning workshop will demonstrate practical applications, followed by presentation sessions and concluding with collaborative analysis of emerging themes.\n\nSubmission Guidelines:\nWe seek extended abstracts (1000-1500 words) that:\n\nPresent clear methodological frameworks\nInclude concrete examples of practice\nDemonstrate critical reflection on outcomes\nConnect practical experiences to philosophical implications\nConsider ethical and social impacts\nDiscuss assessments which benefit from and teach the thoughtful and pragmatic use of AI\nImportant Dates:\nPlease submit your extended abstract on pretalx by 28 Feb 2025 with your extended abstract, intended for participation in the Symposium. It will be read by Brian, Ines, and Max. If it is accepted, we expect that you will be willing to contribute on that topic to an edited volume, due in October 2025. Please contact brian.ballsun-stanton@mq.edu.au earlier if you are planning to submit an abstract so that we may discuss topics and to see if it fits our theme before submission. If it is a good fit, we may provide access to the research material.\n\nSubmit here: https://pretalx.iacapconf.org/iacap-2025/submit/In34fa/info/?submission_type=5232-extended-abstract-for-teaching-ai-symposium-and-volume\n\nOther Details\nResearch and Ethics:\nParticipants with ethics clearance will be given access to deidentified assessments collected as part of a Macquarie University unit on the pragmatics of AI, and are encouraged to get informed consent from their classes to contribute their own tranches of evidence for the case study. Participants are also encouraged to ask their students to contribute reflections and useful evidence on their use of AI for consideration of inclusion in the volume. Please contact brian.ballsun-stanton@mq.edu.au for details if you would like access to this corpus before submitting your extended abstract.\n\nResearchers may also be brought on board Ballsun-Stanton\u2019s program of study, if Australian Human Research Ethics is applicable to your home institution.\n\nTarget Audience:\nEducators adapting to AI-driven changes in teaching\nResearchers investigating AI\u2019s impact on learning\nProfessionals developing AI education programs\nStudents pursuing research in AI and education\nPractitioners interested in ethical AI implementation\nResource Requirements:\nPresenters should note that while the symposium includes technical demonstrations, no programming knowledge is required. Access to frontier AI models will be provided during the workshop portion. Participants in the symposium are expected to read all of the extended abstracts and/or preprints before attending.\n\nThis symposium addresses a critical gap between computational and business-first approaches, offering a humanities-centered perspective on AI education that emphasises both practical application and philosophical reflection. We hope to design a volume which can discuss, with evidence, Breen\u2019s claim that in: \u201cLLMs are deeply, inherently textual. And they are reliant on text in a way that is directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in university humanities classes.\u201d\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI\u2019s o1-preview were used in the editing of this proposal.\n\nIACAP/AISB-25\nIACAP/AISB-25\niacap@ballsun.com\nThe Conference site for the IACAP Conferences"

LOC refers to individuals' beliefs about whether outcomes result from their own actions (internal LOC) or external forces (external LOC).\n\n3. **Methodology**: A longitudinal qualitative case study followed 12 undergraduate students through a semester-long experimental AI unit. Data was collected through surveys, focus groups, and observations.\n\n4. **Results**: Students demonstrated progression toward internal AI-LOC, developing critical awareness and agency in their AI interactions. Scaffolded AI instruction enabled students to view themselves, rather than the technology, as the primary drivers of outcomes.\n\n5. **Pedagogical Approaches**: The teaching methodology included active participation, real-world applicability, scaffolding, mentoring, community building, and experiential learning.\n\n6. **Key Findings**:\n   - Students' perception of AI changed from viewing it as \"fun technology\" to a useful tool\n   - Students became more critical in their use of AI, recognizing both benefits and limitations\n   - Students demonstrated increased confidence and agency in AI interactions\n   - The learning design and pedagogical approach contributed to shifting students' LOC from external to internal\n\n7. **Implications**: The findings suggest structured AI literacy education can empower learners to maintain agency in their AI use.\n\nThe conference call for abstracts focuses on \"Teaching With and About AI using Engagement Philosophy and Case Studies.\" They are seeking extended abstracts that present phenomenological accounts of teaching and learning with AI, analyze patterns of student-AI interaction, document benefits and challenges in communicating AI practices, examine relationships between humanities methodologies and AI literacy, and investigate ethical implications of AI integration in education.\n\nThis research fits well with the conference theme, especially regarding Brando's Engagement Philosophy, which encourages \"direct engagement with our subjects of research, not only as sources of information, but as structural contributors to the development of our research projects and its priorities.\" The paper shows how students were engaged as active participants in the research, and how their experiences shaped understanding of AI's role in education.\n\nFor the extended abstract, I should focus on:\n1. Clear methodology\n2. Concrete examples of practice\n3. Critical reflection on outcomes\n4. Connection of practical experiences to philosophical implications\n5. Ethical and social impacts\n6. Discussion of assessments that benefit from and teach AI use\n\nI'll aim to create a 1000-1500 word extended abstract that highlights the research while framing it within the conference's specific focus on Engagement Philosophy.\n\nThank you for sharing this comprehensive paper about teaching students to interact effectively with LLMs. I understand you'd like to create a ~1000 word extended abstract for the IACAP/AISB-25 conference, specifically for the \"Teaching With and About AI using Engagement Philosophy and Case Studies Symposium.\"\n\nI'll wait for any additional components you mentioned before beginning the draft.

This process involves three interconnected themes:*\u00a0\n***Experiential Engagemen****t: Learners confront novel, ambiguous scenarios that defy prior knowledge.*\u00a0\n***Critical Reflection****: Structured analysis of assumptions and biases underpinning one\u2019s worldview.*\u00a0\n***Rational Discourse****: Dialogic processes to negotiate new understandings collaboratively.*\u00a0\n*These stages directly map onto the challenges of teaching generative AI, where students must grapple with probabilistic outputs, ethical ambiguities, and rapidly evolving technological paradigms.*\u00a0\n\u00a0\n***Conclusion***\u00a0\n*Transformative Learning Theory provides a philosophically coherent and empirically validated foundation for teaching generative AI as an exercise in navigating the unknown. By ****framing AI not as a definitive answer engine but as a provocateur of critical inquiry****, educators can cultivate learners who:*\u00a0\n***Embrace Uncertainty:**** Tolerate ambiguity while systematically probing AI\u2019s limitations.*\u00a0\n***Exercise Ethical Agency****: Advocate for equitable, transparent AI systems.*\u00a0\n***Reimagine Creativity****: Harness AI as a collaborator in transcending conventional thoughtboundaries.*\u00a0\n\u00a0\n*Future research should explore longitudinal impacts of TLT-informed AI pedagogies on lifelong learning mindsets and their scalability across diverse socioeconomic contexts.*\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPhilosophical approach to risk taking\u00a0\n(see Perplexity notes for philosophers)\u00a0\n**Rumsfeld Matrix (https://www.theuncertaintyproject.org/tools/rumsfeld-matrix)**\u00a0\nIn 2002, during a press briefing about the Iraq War, Donald Rumsfeld famously divided information into four categories: known knowns, known unknowns, unknown knowns, and unknown unknowns. These distinctions became the basis for the Rumsfeld Matrix, a decision-making framework that maps and evaluates the various degrees of certainty and uncertainty.\u00a0\nThe four quadrants of the Rumsfeld Matrix\u00a0\n1. **Known knowns: **These are facts or variables that we're aware of and understand. They form the basis of our knowledge and provide a solid foundation for decision making.\u00a0\n1. **Known unknowns: **These are factors we know exist, but don't fully understand. They represent gaps in our knowledge that we must address through research, investigation, or consultation with experts.\u00a0\n1. **Unknown knowns:** These are elements that we don't realize we know. They're typically buried in our subconscious, overlooked, or dismissed as irrelevant.

The focus on developing students' intuition and judgment about AI interactions is particularly interesting.\n\nQuestion 2: Could you describe the specific reflective practices or exercises you used to help students develop this intuition? For example, how did you structure reflection assignments, and what kinds of prompting failures did students commonly experience that led to valuable learning moments?\n\n(For clarity, when I mentioned \"rational discourse,\" I was referring to the collaborative discussion aspect of Transformative Learning Theory - how people talk through and negotiate new understandings together. It sounds like this may have happened naturally in your classroom discussions.)",

How can we do that?\" Another student said: \"Ask the AI how we can use you.\"\n\n<rubric>\nAI Politics and International Relations Schedule and\nAssessments\nSite:iLearnPrinted by:Brian Ballsun-Stanton\nUnit:ARTS3500 Arts Capstone - ARTX3500Date:Thursday, 5 December 2024, 3:54 PM\nBook:AI Politics and International Relations Schedule and\nAssessmentsTable of contents\n1.

This gives me a much clearer picture of how you implemented reflective practices in your AI course.\n\nLet me organize what I've learned from your response about reflective practices:\n\n1. Ritualized reflection at the start of each class (\"Show me your prompts!\") - This established a regular practice of sharing AI interactions and discussing successes and failures.\n\n2. Annotation of AI logs - Students were required to identify effective and ineffective prompts in their interactions, creating a meta-level analysis of their own work.\n\n3. Specific reflection assignments - The detailed rubrics show that reflection was built into multiple assessments:\n   - Assessment 1: Reflection on simulation experience and AI interaction logs\n   - Assessment 2: Reflective analysis of discussion and peer mentoring\n   - Assessment 3: Reflection on simulation experience and AI safety/bias issues\n   - Assessment 4: Position memo requiring analytical thinking about AI implementation\n\n4. Focus on failure as learning - As you mentioned, students learned more from their prompting failures than successes, developing their intuition through trial and error.\n\n5. Progression of skills - You note that students started with basic, search-engine style prompting and gradually developed more sophisticated approaches to context management, output control, and iterative prompting.\n\n6. Socioconstructivist learning - Students learned from each other's experiences and shared insights about effective practices.\n\n7. Locus of control shift - The reflective practices helped move students from external to internal AI-LOC, empowering them to understand they could control and edit outputs rather than accepting them as given.\n\nThe common prompting failures you mentioned are particularly interesting:\n- Too short prompts\n- Lack of structure\n- Minimal explicit information\n- \"One and done\" approach vs. iterative, scaffolded interaction\n- Lack of understanding of context windows\n- Inability to control output register\n- Unclear goals for the conversation\n\nFor the abstract I'm going to craft, this information about reflective practices and common failures provides excellent material to work with. The focus on developing students' intuition through structured reflection aligns well with transformative learning theory's emphasis on critical reflection and experiential learning.\n\nThank you for sharing these details about your reflective practices and the assignment structure. This is very helpful in understanding how you implemented transformative learning principles.\n\nQuestion 3: Based on what you've shared, it seems that your course design created a shift in students' locus of control from external to internal through specific pedagogical approaches.

While education leaders grapple with broad concepts of AI literacy and assessment reform (Lodge et al., 2023; UNESCO, 2024), less attention has been paid to the fundamental pedagogical challenges of teaching within domains characterized by emergent properties, shifting capabilities, and inherent uncertainties. This paper argues that effectively teaching with and about AI requires pedagogical frameworks specifically designed to embrace uncertainty, structure risk-taking, and develop student agency in the face of technological indeterminacy. Drawing on Transformative Learning Theory (Mezirow, 1991) and the epistemological framework of the Rumsfeld Matrix, we examine how deliberately decoupling task success from assessment outcomes creates educational environments where students can develop sophisticated intuitions about AI interaction without the inhibiting effects of grade-related anxieties. This approach directly counters students' initial tendency to defer to AI rather than direct it (Torrington et al., 2024), facilitating a shift toward internal AI-Locus of Control through structured experimentation with failure.\n\n## Theoretical Framework\nTransformative Learning Theory provides a coherent framework for understanding the pedagogical challenges of AI education. Mezirow's theory posits that learning occurs through critical reflection on disorienting dilemmas\u2014experiences that disrupt existing assumptions and necessitate a re-evaluation of beliefs, values, and perspectives. This process involves three interconnected themes particularly relevant to AI education:\n\n*Experiential Engagement:* Learners confront novel, ambiguous scenarios that defy prior knowledge. In our course, AI-augmented role-play simulations created intentional \"disorienting dilemmas\" where students encountered the limitations and biases of AI systems in contexts requiring real-time decision-making.\n\n*Critical Reflection:* Structured analysis of assumptions and biases underpinning one's worldview. Our assessment structure prioritized reflection on both successful and unsuccessful AI interactions, creating a metacognitive space where failures became valuable learning opportunities rather than assessment penalties.\n\n*Rational Discourse:* Dialogic processes to negotiate new understandings collaboratively. We implemented ritualized sharing of prompts, creating a community practice where students collectively analyzed effective and ineffective AI interactions, gradually developing shared intuitions and expectations.\n\nThe Rumsfeld Matrix offers a complementary epistemological framework for conceptualizing the pedagogical challenges of teaching AI literacy. The matrix distinguishes between \"known knowns\" (facts we're aware of and understand), \"known unknowns\" (factors we know exist but don't fully comprehend), \"unknown knowns\" (subconscious knowledge we don't realize we possess), and \"unknown unknowns\" (factors we're unaware of and can't predict). This taxonomy mapped directly to our teaching context:\n\n*Known knowns:* The intentional learning design structure, ritualized classroom practices, and assessment focused on reflection rather than outcomes.\n\n*Known unknowns:* Varying student backgrounds and engagement levels, potential pathways of AI interaction, and limitations of current models.\n\n*Unknown unknowns:* Emergent AI behaviors, unanticipated model limitations, and students' evolving conceptual frameworks for understanding AI.\n\nThe course deliberately designed experiences to transform \"unknown unknowns\" into \"known unknowns\"\u2014making students aware of AI's limitations, biases, and effective interaction patterns through structured experimentation and collective reflection.\n\n## Methodology\nThe pedagogical approach was implemented in a 13-week undergraduate Politics and International Relations course integrating AI tools throughout the curriculum. Students engaged in multiple AI-augmented simulations focused on international relations scenarios, using frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) to articulate different ideological lenses, explore policy options, and analyze outputs for bias and safety risks. The course utilized three primary data sources: student reflections, instructor observations, and annotated AI interaction logs.\n\nThe core methodological innovation was the deliberate decoupling of success in AI activities from assessment outcomes. Students were graded exclusively on their reflections about their experiences\u2014both successes and failures\u2014rather than on the quality of AI outputs or simulation outcomes.

While education leaders grapple with broad concepts of AI literacy and assessment reform (Lodge et al., 2023; UNESCO, 2024), less attention has been paid to the fundamental pedagogical challenges of teaching within domains characterized by emergent properties, shifting capabilities, and inherent uncertainties. This paper argues that effectively teaching with and about AI requires pedagogical frameworks specifically designed to embrace uncertainty, structure risk-taking, and develop student agency in the face of technological indeterminacy. Drawing on Transformative Learning Theory (Mezirow, 1991) and the epistemological framework of the Rumsfeld Matrix, we examine how deliberately decoupling task success from assessment outcomes creates educational environments where students can develop sophisticated intuitions about AI interaction without the inhibiting effects of grade-related anxieties. This approach directly counters students' initial tendency to defer to AI rather than direct it (Torrington et al., 2024), facilitating a shift toward internal AI-Locus of Control through structured experimentation with failure.\n\n## Theoretical Framework\nTransformative Learning Theory provides a coherent framework for understanding the pedagogical challenges of AI education. Mezirow's theory posits that learning occurs through critical reflection on disorienting dilemmas\u2014experiences that disrupt existing assumptions and necessitate a re-evaluation of beliefs, values, and perspectives. This process involves three interconnected themes particularly relevant to AI education:\n\n*Experiential Engagement:* Learners confront novel, ambiguous scenarios that defy prior knowledge. In our course, AI-augmented role-play simulations created intentional \"disorienting dilemmas\" where students encountered the limitations and biases of AI systems in contexts requiring real-time decision-making.\n\n*Critical Reflection:* Structured analysis of assumptions and biases underpinning one's worldview. Our assessment structure prioritized reflection on both successful and unsuccessful AI interactions, creating a metacognitive space where failures became valuable learning opportunities rather than assessment penalties.\n\n*Rational Discourse:* Dialogic processes to negotiate new understandings collaboratively. We implemented ritualized sharing of prompts, creating a community practice where students collectively analyzed effective and ineffective AI interactions, gradually developing shared intuitions and expectations.\n\nThe Rumsfeld Matrix offers a complementary epistemological framework for conceptualizing the pedagogical challenges of teaching AI literacy. The matrix distinguishes between \"known knowns\" (facts we're aware of and understand), \"known unknowns\" (factors we know exist but don't fully comprehend), \"unknown knowns\" (subconscious knowledge we don't realize we possess), and \"unknown unknowns\" (factors we're unaware of and can't predict). This taxonomy mapped directly to our teaching context:\n\n*Known knowns:* The intentional learning design structure, ritualized classroom practices, and assessment focused on reflection rather than outcomes.\n\n*Known unknowns:* Varying student backgrounds and engagement levels, potential pathways of AI interaction, and limitations of current models.\n\n*Unknown unknowns:* Emergent AI behaviors, unanticipated model limitations, and students' evolving conceptual frameworks for understanding AI.\n\nThe course deliberately designed experiences to transform \"unknown unknowns\" into \"known unknowns\"\u2014making students aware of AI's limitations, biases, and effective interaction patterns through structured experimentation and collective reflection.\n\n## Methodology\nThe pedagogical approach was implemented in a 13-week undergraduate Politics and International Relations course integrating AI tools throughout the curriculum. Students engaged in multiple AI-augmented simulations focused on international relations scenarios, using frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) to articulate different ideological lenses, explore policy options, and analyze outputs for bias and safety risks. The course utilized three primary data sources: student reflections, instructor observations, and annotated AI interaction logs.\n\nThe core methodological innovation was the deliberate decoupling of success in AI activities from assessment outcomes. Students were graded exclusively on their reflections about their experiences\u2014both successes and failures\u2014rather than on the quality of AI outputs or simulation outcomes. This approach required significant time investment in building student trust; it took approximately eight weeks of the 13-week course before students fully accepted that experimentation and failure were truly valued in the assessment scheme.\n\nCourse activities were designed to promote transformative learning experiences through three interconnected components:\n\n1. Structured simulations creating disorienting dilemmas with AI systems\n2. Regular critical reflection on AI interactions, biases, and limitations\n3.
