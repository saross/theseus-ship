Here, \u201cmale reproductive physiology\u201d refers to any measure or mechanism related to sperm production (including sperm count, morphology, and seminal fluid composition), endocrine regulation (hormones like testosterone, LH, FSH, GnRH), and morphological or histological shifts in gonads or associated reproductive structures (e.g., testes, seminal glomeruli). Studies discussing neural correlates (brain regions tied to reproduction, including song production) are also relevant if they explicitly address seasonal or breeding-state differences.\nOur goal is to capture data from both field and laboratory studies across diverse avian families, focusing on how hormonal levels, testicular volume, and sperm parameters fluctuate with shifts in photoperiod, resource availability, or other environmental cues or changes in social cues (e.g. previous breeding experience). We are particularly interested in comparative analyses that highlight interspecific or interpopulational differences, as well as underlying ecological and evolutionary drivers of these physiological changes.
