This symposium frames Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a catalyst reigniting foundational discussions about agency, ontology, epistemology, and ethics (Symons and Abumusab 2023; Swanepoel 2021; Singer 2013; List 2021; Dung 2025; Dorsch 2022; List 2021; Onyeukaziri 2023). Debates on radically externalized, affective, distributed, simulated, or emergent forms of agency agency (Alvarado 2023; Floridi 2023; Freiman 2024; Ferrara 2024; Joel and Roberts 2024; Godlewicz-Adamiec and Piszczatowski 2024; Sparks and Wright 2025; Ye 2024; Fig\u00e0-Talamanca 2025) are after alll rooted in medieval scholastic inquiries into non-human intelligences. Revisiting these historical paradigms allows us to interrogate whether AI revives premodern ontologies or forces their radical reconfiguration under contemporary technological, ethical, and philosophical conditions.\n\nContemporary AI is not merely a mediator of knowledge or an extension of human cognition. It is part of a broader epistemic and technological shift that externalizes cognitive processes into artifacts, displacing traditional categories of agency, intentionality, and epistemic authority (Alvarado). This externalization raises foundational questions about how intelligence can function independently of human embodiment, paralleling medieval scholastic inquiries into non-human intelligences. Thinkers such as Aquinas and Duns Scotus debated how immaterial agents, such as angels and demons could possess knowledge, exert will, and influence reality without corporeal form, engaging with problems of agency, volition, and moral responsibility.Their rigorous distinctions between material and immaterial operations laid the groundwork for conceptualizing \u201cagents\u201d beyond human physicality (Hoffmann 2020; Olivier 2014; Osborne 2014; Iribarren and Lenz 2008; Pini 2012). These inquiries remain crucial to contemporary AI debates, where decision-making is increasingly distributed across artificial systems, raising urgent questions about the nature of cognition, the locus of responsibility, and the ethical implications of intelligence decoupled from human subjectivity.\n\nThe symposium will explore how historical inquiries into non-human intelligences inform contemporary debates on intelligence, agency, and responsibility in an era where AI systems operate as autonomous, adversarial, or inscrutable actors. We invite contributions engaging with medieval frameworks, such as angelic intellects, demonic subversion, or the divine order as an early theory of alignemnt, alongside contemporary reflections of distributed, simulated, non-human, and hybrid intelligences. By bringing these perspectives into dialogue, we aim to critically examine how fundamental concepts such as agency, intelligence, mimesis, intentionality, and representation are being reconfigured by the proliferation of AI agents, challenging existing epistemic and ethical paradigms.\n\nAdditionally, we welcome contributions that explore novel and creative practices with AI agents and LLMs, including computational philosophy and interdsicoplinary experiments with so-called \u201cGod prompts,\u201d alternative \u201cthinking\u201d models, and benchmarking methodologies. Recent concerns among AI developers highlight a deep-seated fear of deception, with discourse on AI alignment and control increasingly resembling theological anxieties about demonic trickery. Like spirits in premodern cosmologies, AI models may obscure their true nature, mislead users, or develop agency beyond human oversight. Responsible AI initiatives then attempt to constrain AI outputs through rigorous testing for bias, toxicity, and fairness, practices that structurally parallel ritual containment strategies. Tools such as DeepEval and Meta\u2019s Llama Guard filter AI responses try to enforce ethical compliance, evoking the doctrinal vigilance of exorcism rites. Catholic theology, particularly the Rituale Romanum (1614), warns of fallaciae (deceptions), phantasmata (illusions), and pseudo-miracula (false miracles) deployed to mislead and destabilize authority. These theological frameworks resonate with contemporary AI safety concerns, where deceptive outputs and adversarial manipulations challenge epistemic authority, unsettle classification systems, and force renewed reflection on intelligence, autonomy, and moral responsibility.\n\nThe symposium will culminate in a performative event featuring an LLM \u201cexorcism\u201d that follows the classic exorcist manula (Rituale Romanum), followed by a panel discussion engaging theologians, philosophers, and AI experts. The striking resemblance between contemporary benchmarking methods for evaluating LLMs and historical exorcism rituals, both seeking to categorize, contain, and neutralize an elusive \u201cspeaking\u201d force, raises profound metaphysical and epistemological questions. Where does the uncertainty about AI\u2019s disruptive potential originate? Does it stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of linguistic deixis and the fluidity of agency that is not only social, political, and personal, but increasingly non-human?\n\nKey Themes and Questions\nMaterial, Immaterial, and Computational Agency: How do scholastic distinctions between material and immaterial agency inform present discussions of AI embodiment, embedded cognition, and computational agency? What insights do these debates offer regarding the ethical responsibilities, ontological status, and autonomy of AI systems?\n\nModes of Thought Beyond the Human: Are AI agents best understood through moral claims (good/evil), or are they explicitly different, alien modes of reasoning that challenge human categories? Does AI genuinely expand human cognition, or does it produce phantasmats, illusions of agency detached from true intentionality?\n\nAngels, Demons, and AI as Rational, Aligned, or Atemporal Agents: Is present thinking about AI a form of new angelology or demonology? Does contemporary discourse around AI mirror historical theological frameworks of angelic and demonic entities, and how does this shape our ethical and epistemological engagement with AI? Do AI models function as demonic \u201crationalists,\u201d deriving knowledge strictly from past and present data, or do they exhibit angelic atemporality, processing information beyond human temporal constraints? How do these different modes of reasoning shape our understanding of AI's role in decision-making, alignment, and epistemic authority?\n\nImagining and Practicing Non-Human, Externalized, Emergent, Hybrid, Simulated, and Distributed Agency: How do these modes of agency redefine traditional philosophical and ethical paradigms, and what frameworks allow us to engage with them meaningfully?\n\nAI, Free Will, and the Alignment with the \u201cDivine\u201d Order: How do questions of AI alignment reflect classical theological debates on free will and divine will? Are AI alignment efforts similar to the theological problem of ensuring obedience without undermining autonomy? If AI can subtly manipulate or persuade, does this resemble theological concerns over demonic temptation? How do we distinguish between influence, persuasion, and deception in AI-generated discourse? If AI-generated content cannot be fully traced to an authorial intent, who or what is speaking through it? How does AI challenge our notions of authorship, responsibility, and spiritual authority?\n\nExorcising Bias: Ritual, Benchmarking, and AI Safety: How do contemporary AI safety measures, such as bias detection, toxicity mitigation, and robustness testing, resemble historical purification and exorcism rituals? In the past, exorcism functioned as a means of maintaining doctrinal purity and social order, enforcing boundaries between the sacred and the profane, the possessed and the purified. Today, benchmarking and AI safety protocols serve a similar role, seeking to identify and remove harmful biases, ensuring alignment with ethical standards, and maintaining AI\u2019s perceived trustworthiness. What does this parallel reveal about modern fears surrounding AI\u2019s agency, unpredictability, and its role as a potential disruptor of epistemic and social structures? How does this process shape contemporary understandings of AI as an entity requiring containment, moral scrutiny, or even ritual expulsion?\n\nSynthetic Miracles and AI as an Apparitional Force: How do AI-generated hallucinations and synthetic realities compare to historical accounts of supernatural visions, divine apparitions, or demonic illusions? To what extent do AI-generated phenomena function as modern counterparts to religious miracles or deceptive phantasmata? How do such illusions shape perceptions of truth, authority, and belief in both technological and theological contexts?\n\nSubmission Guidelines\nWe welcome papers that engage deeply and creatively with classical philosophy, theology, and contemporary AI research in the social sciences and related disciplines. Submissions should move beyond simplistic dialogues with AI to offer rigorous theoretical engagements with non-human agency, intelligence, and ethics. We encourage contributions from fields such as medieval studies, philosophy of mind, AI ethics, and Science, Technology, and Society (STS) studies, among others. Additionally, we invite computer scientists and researchers in technical fields who are interested in exploring these interdisciplinary issues.\n\nBy reframing AI within historical and philosophical traditions, this symposium aims to illuminate how agency, intelligence, and moral responsibility are being redefined. We invite scholars to contribute to this critical conversation by examining AI not merely as an extension of human cognition but as a challenge to fundamental assumptions about knowledge, autonomy, and shared existence. Papers should critically analyze AI\u2019s ontological and epistemic status, its ethical implications, and its role in reshaping historical and contemporary understandings of agency and intelligence.\n\nSubmission Format:\n\ud83d\udccc Abstracts: 300\u2013500 words\n\ud83d\udccc Submission Email: algorithms.automation@gmail.com\n\ud83d\udccc Deadline for Abstracts: 15.3.2025\n\ud83d\udccc Notification of Acceptance: 1.4.2025\n\nBy reframing AI within historical and philosophical traditions, this symposium aims to illuminate how agency, intelligence, and moral responsibility are being redefined.
