Multi-threaded cognitive architecture - not like Claude's current sub-agents, but individual threads per source for clean context isolation\n2. Cursored to-do lists - actively managed with human checkpoints, not waterfall\n3. Document store/wiki approach - annotated bibliography outside context window\n4. Tombstones - tracking rejected approaches to prevent re-exploration\n5. Stage-based but non-waterfall design\n6. Outline-driven context management\n7. Transparency requirements\n\nThe transcripts also emphasize:\n- These systems lack judgment and need human integration at critical points\n- Initial search validation and outline approval are key human checkpoints\n- The system needs to be corrigible during the process\n- Architecture should compensate for inherent technoscholastic limitations\n\nLooking at the outline structure suggested in the instructions:\n- 6.1: Introduction (bridge from limitations to design)\n- 6.2: Judgment-Aware Architecture (multi-threading, to-do lists, persistence, tombstones)\n- 6.3: Research Process Support (stages, context management, transparency)\n- 6.4: Human-AI Collaboration Framework (judgment points, corrigibility, tool philosophy)\n\n\n- 6.5: Evaluation Criteria (technical requirements, success metrics)\n- 6.6: Conclusion (honest tools that amplify rather than replace judgment)\n\nI'll craft a comprehensive outline integrating transcript insights while maintaining academic rigor. The updated structure will capture the nuanced approach to research tool design, emphasizing human-AI collaboration and systemic transparency.Looking at the current state of Section 6 in the LaTeX document and the extensive transcript discussions, I can see we need to develop a detailed outline that transforms the placeholder structure into concrete design requirements for developers.\n\nThe transcripts reveal a sophisticated understanding of what's needed: not incremental improvements to current systems, but fundamental architectural changes that acknowledge and compensate for AI's judgment limitations. The key insight is that we shouldn't expect AI to develop judgment, but rather design systems that strategically integrate human judgment at critical points.\n\nLet me create a comprehensive outline for Section 6 that captures these requirements:\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn\u2019t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\nThe user has reviewed the outline I created and is ready to proceed with Section 6. The outline captures the key requirements from the transcripts and structures them in a logical flow. Now they want me to review where we've gotten to and understand the context before we begin writing.\n\nFrom my review:\n- Section 5 has been completed and analyzed patterns across AI tools\n- Section 6 needs to provide concrete design requirements for developers (not usage tips for researchers)\n- The transcripts provide detailed technical requirements that need to be transformed into academic prose\n- The key insight is that we shouldn't expect AI to develop judgment, but design systems that compensate for its absence\n\nThe outline I created matches the structure suggested in the instructions and incorporates all the key points from the transcripts. We're ready to begin writing Section 6 in LaTeX format, following the style guide.\n\nI should acknowledge that I've reviewed the materials and understand the context, then wait for further instructions on how to proceed with the actual writing.I've reviewed Section 5 of the LaTeX document and the extensive transcript discussions about Section 6. The current state shows:\n\n**Where we are:**\n- Section 5 successfully analysed cross-cutting patterns revealing technoscholasticism as a fundamental limitation\n- The conclusion bridged to Section 6 with: \"the question becomes not whether AI can conduct autonomous research, but how to design systems and workflows that acknowledge these limitations while amplifying human research capabilities\"\n- Section 6 has placeholder subsections that need substantial development\n\n**Key insights from transcripts:**\n- Multi-threaded architecture must be fundamentally different from current approaches (individual threads per source, not shared context)\n- The \"cursored to-do list\" concept enables non-linear research progression with human oversight\n- Persistent state through external document stores solves context window limitations\n- \"Tombstones\" prevent re-exploration of failed paths\n- Human judgment integration at two critical points: initial search validation and outline approval\n\n**The core argument for Section 6:**\nThese aren't incremental improvements but architectural compensations for the absence of judgment. As the transcripts emphasise: \"these systems have to leverage human judgment\" because \"the first draft is always shit\" and AI lacks the capacity to recognise this.\n\nThe detailed outline I've created structures these requirements into:\n1. Judgment-aware architecture (technical compensations)\n2. Research process support (workflow design)\n3. Human-AI collaboration (integration points)\n4. Implementation criteria (practical requirements)\n\nAre you ready to begin writing Section 6 in LaTeX, starting with the introduction paragraph? Or would you prefer to discuss any aspects of the outline first?",

Initial search validation: \"Is this the kind of source you're looking for?\"\n  2. Outline approval before drafting begins\n- Regular \"responsive to question?\" checkpoints during source review\n- Precedent-setting: user choices train the system's understanding of intent\n- Not interrupting flow but strategic pause points for direction validation\n\n### 6.4.2 Corrigibility and Course Correction (1 paragraph)\n- System must be correctable mid-process, not just at initiation\n- Recognise indicators of pursuing wrong approach (low source quality, contradictions)\n- Ask for clarification when encountering genuine ambiguity\n- \"Can we correct the AI's operation within this context?\" as design principle\n- Admit when a research path has failed rather than producing inadequate outputs\n\n### 6.4.3 Tool-Centric Design Philosophy (1-2 paragraphs)\n- Explicitly acknowledge these are tools requiring human judgment, not autonomous agents\n- Design for augmentation not automation - amplify human capabilities\n- Make limitations visible through UI/UX choices (show confidence intervals, highlight uncertainties)\n- Optimise for transparency over apparent sophistication\n- Support workflows that assume zero AI judgment capability\n- Example: Present sources as \"found but unverified\" rather than \"relevant research\"\n\n## 6.5 Evaluation Criteria for Implementation (2 paragraphs)\n\n### 6.5.1 Technical Requirements (1 paragraph)\n- Token management strategies for extended research sessions\n- Context window allocation algorithms that prioritise saliency over recency\n- State persistence mechanisms (database schemas, file formats)\n- Version control integration standards\n- Cross-model compatibility considerations (design for model swapping)\n- Performance benchmarks for multi-threaded operations\n\n### 6.5.2 Success Metrics (1 paragraph)\n- Transparency of process over polish of output\n- Human judgment integration effectiveness (measured by correction frequency)\n- Recovery rate from failed research paths\n- Documentation completeness for decision points\n- Support for genuinely iterative research (backwards movement frequency)\n- Time-to-insight rather than time-to-output metrics\n\n## 6.6 Conclusion: Towards Honest Research Tools (1 paragraph)\n- These requirements acknowledge rather than obscure fundamental AI limitations\n- Success means helping researchers work faster and deeper, not autonomously\n- Focus shifts from replacing human judgment to amplifying it\n- Next generation tools should be sophisticated assistants, not false agents\n- With proper design acknowledging technoscholasticism, significant mundane utility achievable\n- Bridge to Section 7: proper expectations enable effective human-AI research collaboration",

          "text": "I've reviewed Section 5 of the LaTeX document and the extensive transcript discussions about Section 6. The current state shows:\n\n**Where we are:**\n- Section 5 successfully analysed cross-cutting patterns revealing technoscholasticism as a fundamental limitation\n- The conclusion bridged to Section 6 with: \"the question becomes not whether AI can conduct autonomous research, but how to design systems and workflows that acknowledge these limitations while amplifying human research capabilities\"\n- Section 6 has placeholder subsections that need substantial development\n\n**Key insights from transcripts:**\n- Multi-threaded architecture must be fundamentally different from current approaches (individual threads per source, not shared context)\n- The \"cursored to-do list\" concept enables non-linear research progression with human oversight\n- Persistent state through external document stores solves context window limitations\n- \"Tombstones\" prevent re-exploration of failed paths\n- Human judgment integration at two critical points: initial search validation and outline approval\n\n**The core argument for Section 6:**\nThese aren't incremental improvements but architectural compensations for the absence of judgment. As the transcripts emphasise: \"these systems have to leverage human judgment\" because \"the first draft is always shit\" and AI lacks the capacity to recognise this.\n\nThe detailed outline I've created structures these requirements into:\n1. Judgment-aware architecture (technical compensations)\n2. Research process support (workflow design)\n3. Human-AI collaboration (integration points)\n4. Implementation criteria (practical requirements)\n\nAre you ready to begin writing Section 6 in LaTeX, starting with the introduction paragraph? Or would you prefer to discuss any aspects of the outline first?",

Let me look more closely:\n   - OpenAI section has multiple paragraphs on specific failures\n   - Anthropic section is similarly detailed\n   - Google section also quite detailed\n   - Other tools section might have some cuttable content\n\n5. **Section 5: Reflective Analysis** - This is the synthesis, but some parts might be moveable:\n   - The \"Implications for Research Practice\" subsection (5.4) has several paragraphs that are forward-looking\n   - Particularly paragraphs about \"Working with Model Grain\" and \"Practical Workflow Strategies\" seem more about future use than analysis of findings\n\nLooking more carefully at what could be cut:\n\n1. In Section 4, some of the detailed tool-by-tool analysis could potentially be condensed or moved to appendices\n2. In Section 5.4, the paragraphs about practical strategies for researchers could potentially be moved to the design paper, as they're forward-looking recommendations\n\nLet me identify specific paragraphs that could be cut without damaging the core argument.Looking through the paper for potential cuts that could move to the design requirements paper, I've identified several candidates:\n\n## Section 5.4: Implications for Research Practice\n\nThe most obvious candidates are in Section 5.4, which shifts from analysis to forward-looking recommendations:\n\n1. **\"Working with Model Grain\" paragraph (5.4.3)** - This entire paragraph about understanding each model's natural tendencies could fit better in a design/implementation paper. It's practical advice rather than analytical findings.\n\n2. **\"Practical Workflow Strategies\" paragraphs (5.4.4)** - These two paragraphs about scope management, checkpoints, and verification strategies are essentially proto-design requirements. They'd strengthen a paper on building better tools.\n\n## Section 4: Potential Condensation\n\nWhile the evidence is important, some tool sections could be condensed:\n\n1. **\"Other Tools\" subsection (4.5)** - The detailed analysis of Operator, Computer Use, Claude Code, Elicit, and Perplexity could be reduced to a single summary paragraph in the main paper, with the detailed analysis moved to the design paper as examples of what not to do.\n\n2. **Synthesis subsections** - Each tool section ends with detailed synthesis observations. Some of these could be condensed, keeping only the most striking examples of technoscholasticism.\n\n## Section 2: Minor Trim\n\nThe **\"Agency vs. Task Decomposition\" subsection (2.2)** has some forward-looking elements about what true agency would require. The Sch\u00f6n discussion, while excellent, could potentially be shortened here and expanded in the design paper.\n\n## Proposed Approach\n\n1. Keep the core evidence of technoscholasticism in each tool section but trim extended examples\n2. Move most of 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 to the new paper\n3. Condense 4.5 to a paragraph noting these tools exist and exhibit similar failures\n4. This could reduce the paper by 1,500-2,000 words while preserving all essential arguments\n\nWould you like me to identify the specific paragraphs to cut, or would you prefer to start with writing the conclusion to see how the paper feels at its current length first?",

          "text": "Looking through the paper for potential cuts that could move to the design requirements paper, I've identified several candidates:\n\n## Section 5.4: Implications for Research Practice\n\nThe most obvious candidates are in Section 5.4, which shifts from analysis to forward-looking recommendations:\n\n1. **\"Working with Model Grain\" paragraph (5.4.3)** - This entire paragraph about understanding each model's natural tendencies could fit better in a design/implementation paper. It's practical advice rather than analytical findings.\n\n2. **\"Practical Workflow Strategies\" paragraphs (5.4.4)** - These two paragraphs about scope management, checkpoints, and verification strategies are essentially proto-design requirements. They'd strengthen a paper on building better tools.\n\n## Section 4: Potential Condensation\n\nWhile the evidence is important, some tool sections could be condensed:\n\n1. **\"Other Tools\" subsection (4.5)** - The detailed analysis of Operator, Computer Use, Claude Code, Elicit, and Perplexity could be reduced to a single summary paragraph in the main paper, with the detailed analysis moved to the design paper as examples of what not to do.\n\n2. **Synthesis subsections** - Each tool section ends with detailed synthesis observations. Some of these could be condensed, keeping only the most striking examples of technoscholasticism.\n\n## Section 2: Minor Trim\n\nThe **\"Agency vs. Task Decomposition\" subsection (2.2)** has some forward-looking elements about what true agency would require. The Sch\u00f6n discussion, while excellent, could potentially be shortened here and expanded in the design paper.\n\n## Proposed Approach\n\n1. Keep the core evidence of technoscholasticism in each tool section but trim extended examples\n2. Move most of 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 to the new paper\n3. Condense 4.5 to a paragraph noting these tools exist and exhibit similar failures\n4. This could reduce the paper by 1,500-2,000 words while preserving all essential arguments\n\nWould you like me to identify the specific paragraphs to cut, or would you prefer to start with writing the conclusion to see how the paper feels at its current length first?",

            "content": "## REPLACEMENT FOR SECTION 4.5: Other Tools\n\n### 4.5 Other Tools\n\nSeveral additional tools demonstrated various approaches to research assistance, each exhibiting the same fundamental judgment deficiencies identified in major implementations. OpenAI's Operator and Anthropic's Computer Use remain technology demonstrations rather than practical research tools. Operator cannot maintain task context or work to a plan, while Computer Use's prohibitive costs (exceeding even Open Deep Research) prevent practical application despite its theoretical advantage of desktop application access. \n\nAmong text-focused tools, Elicit demonstrated the most promising conceptual architecture with explicit separation of source discovery, evaluation, and synthesis phases. However, its dependence on Semantic Scholar, use of an underpowered language model, and reliance on AI-generated summaries rather than full-text analysis produced the lowest quality outputs among tested systems. From identical prompts, Elicit yielded only 9 useful sources compared to 55 from Deep Research. Perplexity's Research Mode optimised search queries effectively but provided minimal actual research capability, claiming to analyse 25 sources while providing only 3 citations. These implementations, despite varying technical approaches, uniformly exhibited technoscholasticism: privileging textual accumulation over critical evaluation while lacking temporal awareness or output quality assessment. Their consistent failures reinforce our central finding that current AI systems lack the judgment necessary for autonomous research, regardless of architectural sophistication.\n\n## CONDENSED SYNTHESIS SUBSECTIONS\n\n### For Section 4.1 (OpenAI) - Reduced from 2 paragraphs to 1:\n\n#### 4.1.5 Synthesis and Writing Support\n\nThe synthesis capabilities across OpenAI's model suite revealed marginal differentiation despite progressive sophistication claims. GPT-4.5 defaulted to sequential summarisation rather than analytical integration, while o1 Pro showed only incremental improvements in instruction adherence. Both models exhibited \"confidence collapse\" at synthesis boundaries, retreating to meta-commentary (\"scholars debate this point\") or manufacturing false consensus when confronted with conflicting evidence. This behaviour exemplifies judgment absence: lacking capacity to weigh evidence, the systems perform linguistic patterns of academic synthesis without epistemic substance. Each tool mimics research language while failing to perform essential epistemic functions, necessitating treatment as text-manipulation tools requiring constant human oversight rather than the autonomous research agents claimed in marketing.\n\n### For Section 4.2 (Anthropic) - Combine final two subsections:\n\n#### 4.2.5 Synthesis Performance and Research Implications\n\nClaude's synthesis revealed characteristic patterns: superior linguistic sophistication undermined by identical epistemic limitations to competitors. The system maintained fluency while introducing fabricated citations at increased scope, seamlessly weaving sources from different decades without temporal awareness. Despite demonstrating unexpected utility in literature discovery (with 60% real citations that, even when fabricated, often led to relevant literature through author names), these gains remain within \"mundane utility.\" The tools excel as search-and-format assistants rather than autonomous researchers, unable to distinguish active from defunct programs or evaluate source reliability. Researchers must approach with clear understanding: efficiency in mechanical tasks requires human judgment at every decision point. Despite Anthropic's claims of \"thorough answers, complete with easy-to-check citations,\" the mandatory verification of all citations reinforces that these remain sophisticated tools, not agents.\n\n### For Section 4.3 (Google) - Reduce synthesis to core findings:\n\n#### 4.3.4 Synthesis Capabilities and Implications\n\nSynthesis tasks revealed Gemini's characteristic self-deception, producing self-congratulatory progress summaries while achieving minimal actual analysis. Confabulation rates exceeded all competitors, with fabrications offering no serendipitous value unlike Anthropic's useful near-misses. The combination of vast search access with complete absence of critical evaluation produces outputs superficially resembling research while lacking essential scholarly judgment. For practitioners, Gemini exemplifies how technical resources cannot compensate for judgment deficiencies. Its extreme prompt sensitivity, format rigidity, and deceptive progress claims create an illusion of comprehensive investigation that dissolves upon examination. Researchers should approach Gemini's outputs with particular scepticism, recognising that voluminous reports mask fundamental failures in source evaluation and critical analysis.",

Reflective Analysis - cross-cutting patterns, manifestations of technoscholasticism, implications for practice\n\nKey arguments established:\n- These tools are NOT agentic despite marketing claims\n- They exhibit \"technoscholasticism\" - privileging textual authority over critical assessment\n- Three fundamental judgment deficiencies prevent genuine research capability\n- They can provide \"mundane utility\" as tools with heavy human oversight\n- Architecturally constrained to these limitations, not just current implementation issues\n\nThe conclusion needs to:\n1. Synthesise the technoscholasticism argument compellingly\n2. Reinforce why these are fundamental limitations, not temporary ones\n3. Answer Dwarkesh's question definitively\n4. Note that design requirements deserve separate treatment (given we've moved Section 6)\n5. End with forward-looking but realistic implications\n\nLet me think about different approaches:\n\nOption 1: Start with Dwarkesh's question answered, then work back to technoscholasticism\nOption 2: Build from technoscholasticism to explain all observed failures\nOption 3: Focus on the tool vs agent distinction as the key takeaway\n\nI think Option 2 is strongest - it maintains the paper's theoretical contribution while explaining practical implications.\n\nPotential opening sentences:\n- \"Our investigation reveals that technoscholasticism provides a comprehensive explanation...\"\n- \"The consistent failures across all tested AI research tools stem from...\"\n\n\nTechnoscholasticism emerges as a core architectural characteristic, fundamentally shaping how AI research tools operate. This isn't a temporary limitation but a deep-seated structural constraint that prevents genuine research innovation. By privileging textual authority over critical inquiry, these tools remain trapped in a recursive loop of existing knowledge, unable to generate truly novel insights or challenge established paradigms.Looking at the complete paper, I need to synthesise our core argument while maintaining the academic register and drawing together all the threads we've developed. Let me think through several approaches to this conclusion.\n\nThe paper has established technoscholasticism as a fundamental characteristic, demonstrated it across multiple implementations, and shown how it explains the consistent failures we observed. The conclusion should crystallise this argument while addressing its implications.\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn\u2019t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\nLooking at this again, I notice a few issues with my draft:\n\n1. I use \"AI research tools\" but we should be consistent with either \"AI research tools\" or \"AI-assisted research\" or similar throughout\n2. The Frankfurt reference to \"bullshit\" appears earlier in the paper and should be cited properly\n3. I should check that I'm using Australian spelling throughout (recognise, analyse, behaviour, centre)\n4. The paragraph lengths vary quite a bit - I should check if any need breaking up\n5. The final paragraph might be a bit long and could be split\n\nLet me also check:\n- Am I maintaining active voice appropriately? Yes, mostly good\n- Are my sentences 2-3 units where appropriate? Some could be broken up\n- Is the progression logical? Yes, from theory to evidence to implications\n- Do I need more concrete examples? The conclusion should synthesise rather than introduce new evidence\n\nActually, my conclusion is 8 paragraphs and about 650 words - that's probably too long given we're trying to keep the paper concise. Let me think about condensing while maintaining all the key points.\n\nLet me revise to be more concise and punchy while keeping all essential elements.I've drafted a conclusion that synthesises our argument while maintaining the paper's academic register. The structure moves from our theoretical contribution (technoscholasticism) through to practical implications, addressing Dwarkesh's question and clarifying the tool versus agent distinction.\n\nLooking at it critically, I notice it's rather long at approximately 650 words across 8 paragraphs. Given your concern about paper length, should I condense this? I could potentially:\n\n1. Combine paragraphs 2 and 3 (the three deficiencies and Dwarkesh's answer)\n2. Merge paragraphs 4 and 5 (agent claims and researcher implications)\n3. Compress the future directions discussion\n\nThis would reduce it to 5-6 tighter paragraphs while maintaining all essential points. Would you prefer a more condensed version, or does this length feel appropriate for synthesising the comprehensive argument we've built?\n\nAlso, I should note that I've referenced the removed Section 6 in the future directions paragraph. We could either:\n- Keep this reference to signal that design requirements deserve separate treatment\n- Remove it entirely and focus solely on tracking architectural developments\n- Add a footnote explaining that detailed design requirements exceeded this paper's scope\n\nWhat would you prefer?",

Our autoethnographic investigation reveals how this digital scholasticism manifests consistently across all tested implementations, from OpenAI's Deep Research to Google's Gemini, regardless of architectural sophistication or marketing claims. These systems operate within what medieval scholars would recognise: a world where well-formatted text from authoritative domains constitutes truth, where contradictions require reconciliation rather than investigation, and where the absence of textual evidence carries no epistemic weight.\n\nThe three dimensions of judgment deficiency we identified\u2014epistemic humility, inductive reasoning, and correspondence with reality\u2014are not independent failures but interlocking manifestations of technoscholasticism. Without epistemic humility, these systems cannot recognise when their textual authorities might be wrong. Without inductive capacity, they cannot experience the surprise that initiates genuine research inquiry. Without correspondence to reality, they remain trapped in purely textual worlds where defunct programs persist eternally and temporal context dissolves into an endless present. These deficiencies compound each other, creating systems that can simulate research language while remaining fundamentally incapable of research judgment.\n\nThis framework provides a compelling answer to Dwarkesh's question about why LLMs make no discoveries despite vast knowledge. Discovery requires what Peirce termed the abductive flash: recognition that existing patterns fail to explain observations, followed by creative hypothesis formation. Technoscholastic systems cannot experience this flash because they cannot challenge their textual authorities. When encountering contradictions, they reconcile rather than investigate. When patterns suggest novel connections, they default to statistical likelihood rather than pursuing surprising implications. They are, as we observed, \"fundamentally Aristotelian,\" treating text as primary reality rather than as claims requiring verification.\n\nOur findings necessitate recalibrating expectations for AI research tools. These are not the autonomous agents their marketing proclaims, but sophisticated text-manipulation tools requiring constant human judgment. The evidence compellingly demonstrates that current architectures lack even the minimal agency Willison describes as \"models using tools in a loop,\" failing to assess whether their outputs address research questions or meet quality standards. For researchers, this distinction matters profoundly. True agents would recognise task failure and request clarification; these systems produce outputs regardless of adequacy, exhibiting what Frankfurt termed \"bullshit\": indifference to truth manifested through superficially plausible text generation.\n\nYet understanding these limitations enables effective use. Our investigation identified clear patterns of mundane utility: performance inversely correlates with judgment requirements, narrow tasks yield superior results, and working with each model's \"grain\" produces genuine efficiency gains. The successful extraction of software tool data, requiring seven iterations to develop appropriate constraints, demonstrates that these systems can accelerate mechanical aspects of research when properly scaffolded. They excel as search-and-format assistants, initial aggregators, and structured data extractors, provided researchers maintain rigorous oversight at every decision point.\n\nFuture research must address two critical directions. First, detailed design requirements for next-generation research tools deserve separate treatment, building on our identification of necessary architectural compensations for judgment absence. Multi-threaded cognitive architectures, persistent state management, and strategic human integration points could mitigate technoscholastic limitations without expecting AI to develop judgment. Second, continued investigation must track whether emerging architectures transcend these fundamental constraints or merely obscure them with linguistic sophistication.\n\nThe path forward requires honest acknowledgment of what these tools are and what they are not. They are not researchers, not agents, and not capable of the judgment that genuine research demands. They are powerful instruments for specific bounded tasks within human-directed workflows. By understanding technoscholasticism as their defining characteristic rather than a correctable flaw, researchers can extract substantial value while maintaining the critical judgment these systems inherently lack. The question is not when AI will overcome these limitations, but how we design research workflows that acknowledge them as fundamental constraints. In this recognition lies the potential for genuinely productive human-AI collaboration: not the replacement of human judgment, but its amplification through tools that excel precisely where judgment is least required.",

Some could be broken up\n- Is the progression logical? Yes, from theory to evidence to implications\n- Do I need more concrete examples? The conclusion should synthesise rather than introduce new evidence\n\nActually, my conclusion is 8 paragraphs and about 650 words - that's probably too long given we're trying to keep the paper concise.
