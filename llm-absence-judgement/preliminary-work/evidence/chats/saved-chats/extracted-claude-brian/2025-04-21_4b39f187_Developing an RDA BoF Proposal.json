The proposal requires a 300-word 'objectives' section. The subject of the BOF is 'application of LLMs to research data management' under the pathway of ' AI meets data: exploring use cases, applications and innovation'. Selection criteria include:\u00a0\n-Alignment with the RDA mission and vision\n-No overlap with existing Interest Groups (IGs) or Working Groups (WGs)\n-Not focused exclusively on one technology / product\nIn addition, it should reference existing IGs and WGs.\u00a0\nThe BOF should consider how to maximise 'mundane utility' from LLMs, embed best practice in open research (e.g., good and explicit research design; overall transparency and - where appropriate in the disciplinary context - reproducibility; machine-actionable FAIR data, research software, and other digital objects; etc.). It should primarily consider LLM use as a partnership between the researchers and the LLM - augmentation rather than automation of research, and look at (possible) pitfalls like the loss of researcher autonomy and diminution of creativity.\n</prompt>\nObjectives\nThe proposed Birds of a Feather (BoF) session aims to explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of research data management (RDM), aligning closely with the Research Data Alliance (RDA) mission to build social and technical bridges that facilitate open data sharing and reuse. Our primary objectives are:\n1. **Explore Practical Use Cases**: Identify and discuss concrete examples where LLMs enhance the efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility of research workflows. This includes improving documentation quality, metadata enrichment, dataset description, and semantic interoperability, contributing to machine-actionable FAIR data and research software.\n2. **Promote Best Practices**: Establish guidelines that embed principles of open research when integrating LLMs into data management tasks. We aim to support explicit research design, transparency, reproducibility (where appropriate), and the generation of FAIR digital objects, ensuring ethical, responsible, and effective use of AI in research.\n3. **Foster Human-LLM Partnerships**: Emphasise augmentation rather than automation, exploring frameworks where researchers retain critical judgement and creative autonomy. This will involve discussions on mitigating potential risks such as over-reliance on AI, diminished researcher agency, and erosion of creativity.\n4. **Identify Gaps and Complementarities**: Ensure our initiative complements rather than overlaps existing RDA Interest Groups (IGs) and Working Groups (WGs), such as the \"FAIR Data Maturity Model WG,\" \"Research Metadata Schemas WG,\" and \"Ethics and Social Aspects of Data IG.\" This approach ensures broad relevance across diverse disciplines and technological contexts, aligning with RDA's interdisciplinary ethos.\nUltimately, this BoF will collaboratively explore strategies for maximising the \"mundane utility\" of LLMs in research, creating a shared understanding of opportunities and challenges while maintaining alignment with RDA\u2019s vision of an open, interconnected research data ecosystem.\n</draft>\n\n\n<form>\n**My Profile**\n**LogoutContact**\n* Who We Are\n* What We Do\n* What We Work On\n* Get involved\n* Events\n* RDA Groups\n* News & Media\n**Birds of a Feather (BoF) Session Application Form for the RDA\u2019s 25th Plenary, 13-16 October 2025**\n*Please ensure all required fields (*) are completed before submitting the form.*\n* Session Abstract\n* Preferences & Conflict Considerations\n* Plenary Details\n**Session Abstract**\nSession Title *\nWe strongly encourage you to make your session title brief and short. 7-10 words is the optimal length for a session title.\nMeeting objectives *\nParagraph\n\u00a0\nMeeting presenters *\nPlease include presenters name, separated by comma\nMeeting agenda *\nParagraph\n\u00a0\nHave you presented a session on the same topic at any previous plenaries? *\n* **Yes**\n* **No**\nAdditional links to informative material\nParagraph\n\u00a0\n\n* **Search All Groups**\n* **Search Recommendations & Outputs**\n* **Adoption Stories**\n**Who We Are**\n* About RDA\n* Code of Conduct\n* Our Governance\n* Our Strategy\n**Stakeholders**\n* Early Career Individuals\n* Funders & Policy Makers\n* Industry\n* Infrastructure Providers\n* Libraries\n* Regions\n* Research Performing Organisations\n**Memberships**\n* Individual Membership\n* Organisational & Affiliate Membership\n* Regional membership\n* **Follow us on X**\n* **Follow us on LinkedIn**\n* **Follow us on Custom/Other**\n* **Follow us on Youtube**\n\u00a9 2025 Research Data Alliance | Privacy Policy\n**Subscribe**\n</form>\n(We're going to want to strip that draft down to its bones for ideas.

      "text": "\nThank you for providing the BoF description, a previous draft of a proposal, and the application form for the RDA's 25th Plenary. Let me analyze these materials to understand what we're working with.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a BoF (Birds of a Feather) session is in this context. Based on the first document:\n- It's a one-off meeting at a plenary where RDA members can propose a topic to assess interest\n- The outcome would be either converting the idea to an Interest Group (IG) or Working Group (WG), or retiring the idea\n- Selection criteria include:\n  * Alignment with RDA mission and vision\n  * No overlap with existing IGs/WGs\n  * Not exclusively focused on one technology/product\n\nFrom the previous draft, I can see:\n- The topic is \"application of LLMs to research data management\"\n- It falls under \"AI meets data: exploring use cases, applications and innovation\"\n- The focus is on \"mundane utility\" of LLMs, best practices in open research, and viewing LLMs as partnership/augmentation rather than automation\n- Potential pitfalls include loss of researcher autonomy and diminished creativity\n- The previous draft has four main objectives\n\nFrom the application form, I can see we need to create:\n1. Session Title (7-10 words recommended)\n2. Meeting objectives\n3. Meeting presenters\n4. Meeting agenda\n\nYou mentioned \"stripping down that draft to its bones for ideas\" and that you \"loathe the register\" - which I take to mean you want a cleaner, more direct approach to the language and content.\n\nNow let me think about effective questions to ask. I need to understand what you want to keep from the previous proposal and what you want to change or improve. I also need to understand if there's any new focus or direction you want to take.\n\nMy first question should probably establish what you liked and didn't like about the previous draft, and what your current priorities are for this BoF session.\n\nThank you for sharing these documents. I now have a better understanding of the RDA BoF proposal requirements and your previous draft. \n\nMy first question: What specific aspects of the previous draft do you want to preserve, and what elements do you feel need the most significant revision or improvement?",

Let me analyze these materials to understand what we're working with.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a BoF (Birds of a Feather) session is in this context. Based on the first document:\n- It's a one-off meeting at a plenary where RDA members can propose a topic to assess interest\n- The outcome would be either converting the idea to an Interest Group (IG) or Working Group (WG), or retiring the idea\n- Selection criteria include:\n  * Alignment with RDA mission and vision\n  * No overlap with existing IGs/WGs\n  * Not exclusively focused on one technology/product\n\nFrom the previous draft, I can see:\n- The topic is \"application of LLMs to research data management\"\n- It falls under \"AI meets data: exploring use cases, applications and innovation\"\n- The focus is on \"mundane utility\" of LLMs, best practices in open research, and viewing LLMs as partnership/augmentation rather than automation\n- Potential pitfalls include loss of researcher autonomy and diminished creativity\n- The previous draft has four main objectives\n\nFrom the application form, I can see we need to create:\n1. Session Title (7-10 words recommended)\n2. Meeting objectives\n3. Meeting presenters\n4. Meeting agenda\n\nYou mentioned \"stripping down that draft to its bones for ideas\" and that you \"loathe the register\" - which I take to mean you want a cleaner, more direct approach to the language and content.\n\nNow let me think about effective questions to ask. I need to understand what you want to keep from the previous proposal and what you want to change or improve. I also need to understand if there's any new focus or direction you want to take.\n\nMy first question should probably establish what you liked and didn't like about the previous draft, and what your current priorities are for this BoF session.",

Here's a 300-word objectives section that addresses your requirements:\n**Objectives**\nThis Birds of a Feather session aims to explore the responsible integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into research data management workflows while preserving researcher agency and creativity. Our objectives are to:\n1. Identify practical, \"mundane utility\" applications of LLMs that enhance research data management without replacing human expertise or judgment. This includes data documentation, metadata generation, and improving data discoverability while maintaining researcher oversight.\n2. Develop frameworks for human-LLM partnerships that augment rather than automate research processes, positioning LLMs as assistive tools that expand capabilities while researchers retain decision-making authority.\n3. Examine potential integration points with existing RDA work, particularly the FAIR Data Maturity Model WG and the Research Metadata Schemas IG, to ensure LLM applications align with established best practices for machine-actionable research outputs.\n4. Outline governance principles for LLM use in research that preserve transparency, reproducibility, and researcher autonomy while leveraging AI capabilities. This includes documenting LLM contributions to research processes and outputs.\n5. Map potential pitfalls including overreliance on LLMs, erosion of researcher skills, and hidden biases in model-assisted data management, with corresponding mitigation strategies.\n6. Establish a cross-disciplinary community of practice sharing effective patterns for LLM integration that respect disciplinary norms while promoting open science principles.\nThis BOF distinguishes itself from existing RDA groups by specifically focusing on the human-LLM partnership paradigm in research data management, rather than on general AI applications or specific technical implementations. By bringing together researchers, data managers, and AI specialists, we aim to develop guidance that maximizes LLM benefits while preserving the human creativity and critical thinking essential to scientific advancement.\n</attempt2>\n\nMy colleague says: \"but emphasis isn't quite right, needs more about FAIR, data improvement, data legibility, somewhat less on augmentation vs. automation\"\n\nFor me, my most important thing is around \"How do we turn the prompting and outputs of LLM interactions into a data standard? How can we get consistent reporting on AI use such that not only is it disclosed, but people have standards on how each other have prompted and used specific models? How can we develop norms and tools around this part of the research data lifecycle, to allow for FAIR data production from LLM use?\"",

      "text": "\nI'm getting a clearer picture of the vision now. The proposer wants to focus on:\n\n1. A general approach to standardizing LLM interactions across research\n2. Emphasizing the humanities perspective where prompting itself is considered a data artifact\n3. The human practice of creating and using prompts as a scholarly activity \n4. Ensuring that LLM use in research contributes to FAIR data principles\n\nThey prioritize researcher-to-researcher sharing of effective prompts as the primary use case, followed by journal/publisher requirements for AI disclosure, and then repository archiving of AI-assisted research artifacts.\n\nThe mention of \"riffing on Breen\" likely refers to work by a scholar named Breen who has discussed textual technologies from a humanities perspective.\n\nFor the BoF proposal, I should shape it around:\n1. The need to standardize documentation of LLM interactions in research\n2. Treating prompts as scholarly artifacts that deserve documentation, citation, and curation\n3. Developing formats and tools (like bookmarklets, RO-crate extensions) to support this\n4. Creating ethical and technical norms for AI use throughout the research lifecycle\n5.

As LLMs become integral to research processes across disciplines, the prompts and interactions themselves constitute valuable data artifacts that warrant standardization and preservation. Our objectives are to:\n\n1. Frame LLM prompting as a formal research methodology requiring documentation standards comparable to code, protocols, and other methodology components, enabling transparency and reproducibility\n\n2. Address the current lack of norms, formats, and tools for documenting AI use in research by establishing foundational principles for an \"LLM interaction standard\" that aligns with FAIR data principles\n\n3. Develop preliminary specifications for formats and tools (such as bookmarklets or browser extensions) that could capture LLM interactions as structured, shareable research objects\n\n4. Explore opportunities to extend existing frameworks (like RO-Crate) to incorporate LLM interaction documentation, and identify potential repository solutions for a community-maintained \"grimoire\" of research prompts\n\n5. Initiate cross-disciplinary discussions that will form the basis for potential working groups focused on technical standards, ethical norms, and disciplinary best practices for LLM use throughout the research data lifecycle\n\nThis BoF distinguishes itself from existing RDA groups by specifically addressing the emerging need to treat researcher-LLM interactions as data artifacts worthy of standardization, documentation, and sharing within the open science ecosystem.\n\n## Meeting Presenters\n[Your name and affiliations, plus any co-presenters]\n\n## Meeting Agenda\n1. Introduction and Problem Statement (10 minutes)\n   - Framing prompting as methodology\n   - Current fragmented landscape of AI use disclosure\n   - The concept of \"research grimoires\" in the scholarly context\n\n2. Current Challenges in Documenting LLM Research Use (15 minutes)\n   - Missing standards for prompt documentation\n   - Inconsistent publisher/journal requirements\n   - Technical barriers to capturing interactions\n   - Ethical considerations in sharing prompts\n\n3. Interactive Discussion: Requirements Gathering (20 minutes)\n   - What elements of LLM interactions need standardization?\n   - Which existing standards might be extended?\n   - What tools would facilitate documentation?\n\n4. Formation of Potential Working Themes (30 minutes)\n   - Breakout discussions on key areas of interest\n   - Identifying champions for potential working groups\n   - Documenting shared priorities across themes\n\n5. Next Steps and Action Items (15 minutes)\n   - Synthesizing outcomes\n   - Establishing communication channels\n   - Timeline for follow-up activities\n\n## Additional Links to Informative Material\n- Mollick, E.

As LLMs become integral to research processes across disciplines, the prompts and interactions themselves constitute valuable data artifacts that warrant standardization and preservation. Our objectives are to:\n\n1. Frame LLM prompting as a formal research methodology requiring documentation standards comparable to code, protocols, and other methodology components, enabling transparency and reproducibility\n\n2. Address the current lack of norms, formats, and tools for documenting AI use in research by establishing foundational principles for an \"LLM interaction standard\" that aligns with FAIR data principles\n\n3. Develop preliminary specifications for formats and tools (such as bookmarklets or browser extensions) that could capture LLM interactions as structured, shareable research objects\n\n4. Explore opportunities to extend existing frameworks (like RO-Crate) to incorporate LLM interaction documentation, and identify potential repository solutions for a community-maintained \"grimoire\" of research prompts\n\n5. Initiate cross-disciplinary discussions that will form the basis for potential working groups focused on technical standards, ethical norms, and disciplinary best practices for LLM use throughout the research data lifecycle\n\nThis BoF distinguishes itself from existing RDA groups by specifically addressing the emerging need to treat researcher-LLM interactions as data artifacts worthy of standardization, documentation, and sharing within the open science ecosystem.\n\n## Meeting Presenters\n[Your name and affiliations, plus any co-presenters]\n\n## Meeting Agenda\n1. Introduction and Problem Statement (10 minutes)\n   - Framing prompting as methodology\n   - Current fragmented landscape of AI use disclosure\n   - The concept of \"research grimoires\" in the scholarly context\n\n2. Current Challenges in Documenting LLM Research Use (15 minutes)\n   - Missing standards for prompt documentation\n   - Inconsistent publisher/journal requirements\n   - Technical barriers to capturing interactions\n   - Ethical considerations in sharing prompts\n\n3. Interactive Discussion: Requirements Gathering (20 minutes)\n   - What elements of LLM interactions need standardization?\n   - Which existing standards might be extended?\n   - What tools would facilitate documentation?\n\n4. Formation of Potential Working Themes (30 minutes)\n   - Breakout discussions on key areas of interest\n   - Identifying champions for potential working groups\n   - Documenting shared priorities across themes\n\n5. Next Steps and Action Items (15 minutes)\n   - Synthesizing outcomes\n   - Establishing communication channels\n   - Timeline for follow-up activities\n\n## Additional Links to Informative Material\n- Mollick, E.
