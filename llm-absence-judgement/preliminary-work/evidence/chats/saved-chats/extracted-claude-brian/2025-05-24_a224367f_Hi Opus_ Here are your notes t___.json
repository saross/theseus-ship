Section 4 Writing Notes and Evidence.md - This contains:\n   - Key analytical framework (3 judgment deficiency categories)\n   - Specific evidence by tool\n   - Key examples across tools\n   - Writing reminders\n   - Implicit template per tool\n   - Scope/confabulation insight\n   - Willison quote context\n\n3. transcript.tex - This contains multiple transcribed conversations about the research experience with these tools. There are many specific examples and observations.\n\nNow let me functionally decompose the task:\n\n1. Transform outline \u2192 paragraph-by-paragraph structure with claims, evidence, warrants\n2. Ensure Section 4 provides concrete evidence for the paper's core thesis\n3. Each tool section must demonstrate:\n   - Specific judgment failures (epistemic humility, inductive capacity, correspondence with reality)\n\n\n4.
