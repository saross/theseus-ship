(I'm including that as a joke since the folks at the research data alliance may appreciate it...)\n\nI need to figure out how to bullet my intro text:\n\n<intro_blurb>\nDr Brian Ballsun-Stanton is leading Macquarie University's Faculty of Arts understanding, policy, teaching, and research initiatives around the techniques and appropriate uses of Generative AI. With a PhD in Philosophy of Data that enables him to bridge theoretical frameworks with practical implementations, he has developed the university's \"Guidance Note: Using Generative Artificial Intelligence in Research\" and pioneered AI integration across multiple disciplines, winning the 2024 Faculty of Arts Educational Leadership Award for his innovative work in AI-enhanced learning. His implementations span Languages, Security Studies, and Law, each featuring unique aspects such as AI-optional and AI-required assessments, cross-model critical evaluation, and simulations. He teaches the effective use and techniques of generative AI to undergraduate and post-graduate students, reaching more than 1,500 students through various initiatives.Brian has conducted invited workshops and presentations on LLMs for staff, postgraduate students, and external stakeholders internationally, in Europe and the United States. He has presented his \"Introduction to LLM\" workshop to early-career researchers and postgraduate students across Australia, the United States, and Europe on more than 20 occasions and has advised organisations from the University of Tasmania to NBNco on AI policy and implementation. His work on effective AI use has led to invitations from IEEE Silicon Valley and multiple Australian universities to present and consult on policy and practical pedagogy.He has more than 15 years of experience as a data scientist, educator, sysadmin, and data security specialist, with particular expertise in natural language processing and social network analysis. He has served as Chief Investigator on grants and projects in humanities, social sciences, and security studies totalling over AUD$3,559,083, and has led a big data investigation of violent extremism using tens of millions of social media posts. As Technical Director for the FAIMS Project, he has delivered more than 70 field data collection modules since 2013, bridging the needs of archaeology, geology, ecology, and oral history projects. Brian is an internationally respected researcher in the Digital Humanities with 18 peer-reviewed publications, commissioned reports, newspaper articles, book chapters, and conference presentations, including recent publications on AI policy and implementation in higher education.In the digital humanities, he has established himself as a mentor and leader, guiding researchers and emerging scholars in the effective use of technology for digitally enabled research. His experience implementing theoretically informed technical solutions while accommodating diverse research practices has made him a key figure in bridging technological innovation with humanities scholarship, university AI policy, and educational leadership.\n</intro_blurb>\n\nWhat 3-4 bullets do you recommend for that intro slide, besides linking to my orcid?",
