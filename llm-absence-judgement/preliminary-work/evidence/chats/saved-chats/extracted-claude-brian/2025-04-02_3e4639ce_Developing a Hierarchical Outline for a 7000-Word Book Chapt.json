          "extracted_content": "Okay, here is the transcription of the conversation, diarised and segmented according to the two questions discussed.\n\n***\n\n## q1: \"My first question: Your abstract introduces the \"Rumsfeld Matrix\" alongside Transformative Learning Theory as a key theoretical framework, but I'm curious about the specific methodological connection between these frameworks. How exactly did you operationalize the movement from \"unknown unknowns\" to \"known unknowns\" in your course design, and what specific indicators or evidence did you collect to demonstrate this epistemological shift in students?\"\n\n**Brian:** Uh, all right. So, sound check. It is okay. Volume keeps dropping. Don't love that. But cool, we now have good volume. Okay. Um, we'll do the first question. Your abstract introduces the Rumsfeld Matrix along Transformative Learning Theory as a key theoretical framework, but I'm curious about the specific methodological connection between these frameworks. How exactly did you operationalize \u2013 noting that we're using Australian spelling here AI \u2013 the movement from unknown unknowns to known unknowns in your course design, and what specific indicators or evidence did you collect to demonstrate this epistemological shift in students? Your question is incorrect.\n**Brian:** We are doing this as a description or, oh nope, and the volume just dropped again. Okay.\n**Brian:** Uh, I think it's going to be Slack that's dropping volume.\n**Brian:** So I'll just quit Slack.\n**Brian:** Okay.\n**Brian:** Cool. Volume is back up.\n**Brian:** Although now we're, whatever, it doesn't matter.\n**Brian:** Um, your question is incorrect. So, when we, when we ran, when I ran ARPS 3500,\n**Brian:** it was with the intention of teaching students, volume dropped again.\n**Brian:** I, I, there are too many things fighting.\n**Brian:** Where's Teams?\n**Brian:** Here's Teams.\n**Brian:** And where's Zoom?\n**Brian:** There's Zoom.\n**Brian:** Okay.\n**Brian:** Again, volume up, volume up.\n**Brian:** You know, trying to, trying to do this is, is, is kind of a joke. Okay. Um,\n**Brian:** my intention when teaching wasn't to deal with Rumsfeld's matrix or to deal with any of this. My intention with teaching was to engage with this as one of Brian's textual technologies.\n**Brian:** Um,\n**Brian:** And so, it wasn't so much\n**Brian:** me using the Rumsfeld matrix or\n**Brian:** whatever. You know what? Just speak up, use your indoor voice.\n**Brian:** Um, it wasn't me using the Rumsfeld matrix, it wasn't any of that. It was, um,\n**Brian:** convincing these humanity students\n**Brian:** that they could learn this.\n**Brian:** Um, don't really want to talk about Dweck here. I think, I think bringing in fixed mindset is, is wrong. But\n**Brian:** in my, in my teaching, in, in terms of like, uh, software carpentry instructor training, breaking through fixed mindset was actually quite part of that. And so for me, this was breaking through the, the intentions that the students\n**Brian:** couldn't learn this, not the intentions, the, the mindset that the students couldn't learn this and couldn't master this. And instead, swapping to a place where they\n**Brian:** could play\n**Brian:** and fail, and that they would trust me to catch them.\n**Jodie:** And I think on reflection of that experimental class experience and the change in mindset that we observed, we almost backward mapped it to transformative learning theory. So in terms of transformative learning theory and its components of experiential engagement, we, you know, you did present them with um, a disorientating dilemma and that was even using and incorporating AI into their.\n**Brian:** Almost every week, to be clear. Yes.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** Like, yeah.\n**Jodie:** And so, um, you know, through the, the, the role play simulations, through the learning design, that also created intentional disorientating dilemmas.\n**Brian:** Yes, and actually quite intentionally. Um.\n**Jodie:** So where they encountered like limitations and biases of AI systems.\n**Brian:** Yes, because that was the point of this, this section of the class was to do this. And that was also the structure of my reflections.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. And so though that was like in a context that created then real-time decision making. So that was, you know, sitting in that disorientating dilemma, which married very nicely with um, the transformative learning theory part. And also in terms of transformative learning theory, the critical reflections, which, you know, you, you were doing continuously throughout\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n**Jodie:** as a key part of your learning design.\n**Brian:** Although, like quite specifically, like, besides getting them to reflect in class, the fact that they, I had them reflecting on their prompting, the week six assignment.\n**Jodie:** Yes.\n**Brian:** I actually thought was, is very intentional here. Because I, basically what I did in that was I connected their quality of words with the quality of output, and I forced them to really sit and stew in what didn't they like about the output, and then more to the point, how did they cause that?\n**Jodie:** Yeah. And I guess then reflecting on, like it was a, that metacognitive space where their failures became valuable learning opportunities\n**Jodie:** rather than assessment penalties, and that, that's the whole thing too. And I guess the, the final part of the transformative learning theory is about rational discourse,\n**Jodie:** and you were able to, like your whole, once again, learning design process focused on the ability for both students and yourself to negotiate new understandings, collaboratively. So collaboratively come up with and discuss why things worked, why things didn't work.\n**Brian:** To create a structure for the future. So that was the week nine assignment where they were literally going, giving me mentorship.\n**Jodie:** So it was that collab- like community of practice, I guess, that was developed throughout the semester.\n**Jodie:** Um, where they, you know, that socio-constructivist type of approach, you can look at what worked, what didn't work. Um, and sharing their intuitions about AI and their experiences with AI. So I think all of those components of that transformative learning theory,\n**Jodie:** just it it explains the experience.\n**Brian:** Great.\n**Jodie:** You know what I mean? I think nicely. And in terms of connecting it to\n**Jodie:** Rumsfeld's matrix.\n**Brian:** I mean, a lot of this was confronting the students and getting them to realize that their mental models of AI didn't correspond with the tool itself.\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n**Brian:** Right? To, to, to move\n**Brian:** knowledge of AI qua tool into a known unknown from an unknown unknown.\n**Jodie:** Right. Yeah.\n**Brian:** Where, where the students, like, if, if we take a look at some of their case studies,\n**Brian:** Um,\n**Brian:** which I should have prepared earlier, but\n**Brian:** whatever. Um,\n**Brian:** Of course I've closed Slack, which is great. Uh, if we take a look at some of their case studies, um,\n**Brian:** Let's see here. We have\n**Brian:** No, so Lily, sorry, I'm just meditating on document and then has attachments.\n**Brian:** Okay, so Francesca's thing,\n**Brian:** Yeah, like it, you know, when, when, when she noted that a student said, our degrees are going to have so much more value in the future, even with the growth of AI, because we are the humanities, we are the people and AI is not human, it will never be able to do what we do,\n**Brian:** is realizing\n**Brian:** the correct\n**Brian:** level of control that the students had over AI,\n**Brian:** rather than them treating it as an all-knowing fact generator or treating engine?\n**Jodie:** Mmm.\n**Brian:** Like this, this draws on our locus of control stuff. But effectively, the, the, when,\n**Brian:** when students were started the class, they were very skeptical.\n**Brian:** They mostly saw this as a\n**Brian:** um,\n**Brian:** reason not to take the, the, the main, um, unit. Um,\n**Brian:** they, they,\n**Jodie:** I guess, Yeah. if we talk about mapping it to Rumsfeld matrix. Yeah.\n**Jodie:** Like, quite a pragmatic sense, the known knowns, you had an intentional learning design structure\n**Brian:** Yes.\n**Jodie:** that has been developed from\n**Jodie:** your extensive knowledge and experience.\n**Jodie:** Uh, so you came into this experience with\n**Jodie:** how you wanted to...\n**Brian:** How I would teach my class.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** Well, specifically, how, like, I had knowledge of how to teach technology.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** And so I treated this as a technology teaching challenge, not as, as a plastic pal who's fun to be with challenge.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. And I guess the known knowns for yourself in terms of the way you like to structure your class.\n**Brian:** Yes. So how do I structure my class? What are my norms in teaching?\n**Jodie:** Your expectations for, um, even collaborative participation and just the way you allowed them to have a voice.\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n**Jodie:** You know, that's part of your teaching philosophy.\n**Brian:** Absolutely. Yeah.\n**Jodie:** And that's part of your known knowns. Um, and the fact that you did want the assessment to kind of be, shall we say, flipped, but not about the content of AI per se, but about the reflections of and measuring their growth and understanding, um, which kind of shown demonstrated how they moved into those different categories of known, known unknowns and, you know, unknown unknowns. Um, yeah. And I guess, like, you know, really, like, the known unknowns, you didn't know the students' backgrounds. You didn't know how, how engaged or interested they were in AI. Yeah. Um, you didn't know the potential pathways of the interactions with AI, uh, because and how, how the class would kind of developed. You went in with a, uh, sense of sense of risk, like in...\n**Brian:** Oh, a great deal of risk. I knew that I didn't know...\n**Jodie:** And you were prepared. Like that was not outside your comfort zone. You were prepared to like jump in and...\n**Brian:** And find out.\n**Jodie:** And find out together.\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n**Jodie:** With your students. And, uh, so there's that I guess mindset that you came with your teaching approach.\n**Jodie:** And I guess unknown unknowns, like,\n**Jodie:** you they behaviors towards AI, like you didn't know how that would actually go. Um, and where they would end up in the course with their understanding conceptually of AI.\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n**Jodie:** Like, you didn't know how far this would go. And how successful, to be honest, like looking back. And it was fantastic.\n**Brian:** Oh, absolutely. It was so successful. But no, I didn't, we didn't know that that worked. And so, you know, Marina said in her intro to her case study, um,\n**Brian:** I took part in an experimental philosophy of AI unit. I chose the subject as I was eager to engage in deeper philosophies, uh, philosophical analyses of AI, rather than repeat the same conversations that had been occupying my newsfeed.\n**Brian:** Um, how students were using AI to write their essays, how stupid we'll all become, et cetera.\n**Brian:** Um, and then, and I wasn't necessarily scared of AI before this, but I didn't use it as I didn't know how to. Over the course of the semester, I became significantly less intimidated by the topic and more confident in using LLMs. It was as if this endlessly complex, big bad technology shrank before my eyes.\n**Jodie:** Mmm.\n**Brian:** Um, and then the next paragraph, um, there was little other scope provided, and we were encouraged not to limit ourselves in determining what this meant. The approach of the teaching staff embraced uncertainty, frustration, active experimentation, and failure, thereby paralleling many of the contemporary concerns surrounding AI.\n**Jodie:** That's an interesting point, isn't it? Paralleling the... And I guess if, uh, we're focusing on, uh, the approach of teachers is how to, how to, how to teach about AI and how to embrace that risk and pedagogical risk. Yeah. Then yeah, we hope that the two frameworks we've chosen, um, like, they support each other. I guess I'll say that more, more scholarly. Absolutely. Yeah. Is that enough for this section or?\n**Brian:** Yeah, I mean, like I, I can, I can keep pulling this up, but we, we basically had the same vibes for, for all of these. Um,\n**Jodie:** I mean, so you did an approach using an AI, uh, like learning design using simulations, and that created disorientating dilemmas, as well as the big picture of it being a disorientating dilemma in itself. Yeah. And then you planned regular critical reflections and, and then you, you know, that facilitated those rational discourses. Yeah. And that kind of impacted students themselves, I guess, changing from the unknown unknowns to perhaps known unknowns.\n**Brian:** Quite intentionally, my reflections were there to push them from unknown unknowns to known unknowns because I forced them to, to engage in this metacognitive theory.\n**Jodie:** But I don't think you were aiming for known knowns.\n**Brian:** No, no, no, no.\n**Jodie:** Nobody knows.\n**Brian:** I, I wanted them to realize what they didn't know so that we could start to have the conversation. That took eight weeks.\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n**Brian:** Well, that was question one. Uh, it was 15 minutes conversation. I think that was good. And now I've lost the screens again.\n\n***\n\n## q2: \"**First specific and pointed question:** In your extended abstract, you emphasize the deliberate pedagogical strategy of decoupling students' success in AI activities from their assessment outcomes to encourage structured risk-taking. You claim this approach significantly enhanced students' agency and critical intuition about AI interactions. However, given traditional higher education frameworks\u2014where success and clear metrics of achievement are often closely linked to student motivation\u2014what **specific evidence or theoretical backing** do you have, or plan to gather, to substantiate the claim that decoupling success from assessment does not undermine student motivation or lead to disengagement, particularly among students who might be strongly grade-oriented or traditionally risk-averse?\"\n\n**Brian:** Question two.\n**Brian:** In your extended abstract, you emphasize, oh God, the deliberative, deliberate, let's try that again. In your extended abstract, you emphasize the deliberate pedagogical strategy of decoupling student success in AI activities from their assessment outcomes to encourage structured risk-taking. You claim this approach significantly enhanced students' agency and critical intuition about AI interactions. However, given traditional higher education frameworks where success and clear metrics of achievement are often loosely linked to student motivation, what specific evidence or theoretical backing do you have or plan to gather to substantiate the claim that decoupling success from assessment does not undermine student motivation or lead to disengagement, particularly among students who might be strongly grade-oriented or traditionally risk-averse?\n**Brian:** Woof.\n**Jodie:** Woof.\n**Brian:** I, you want to go?\n**Jodie:** Uh, yeah. Um, hang on.\n**Jodie:** I just...\n**Brian:** I mean, honestly, this is where I would like us to talk about our colleague Honneth paper.\n**Brian:** Um, this also going to be in the volume. Um, Oh no, now I have to find that one.\n**Jodie:** Um, well,\n**Jodie:** Where, where is it?\n**Jodie:** I, I don't have, like, I can't pull out at the moment off the top of my head, but there is a lot of research on teacher-student relationships and the impact that that has on motivation and, um, and then you could argue motivation then leads, can lead to, you know, academic success and outcomes. I think that, um,\n**Brian:** I mean, this is, this is exactly what Marina was talking about.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. So we're moving, looking at the process of learning. Yeah. And there's a lot of self-regulated learning research. Uh, if you look at, you know, Zimmerman, you look at Pintrich, like all sorts of things that the process of learning, um, also contributed, like getting that sorted also contributes to academic achievement. So it's not just purely the output of learning. So we're more focused on the, the process and connection. You can argue that your approach of community of practice and that rational discourse really fostered a strong rapport.\n**Brian:** Yes.\n**Jodie:** Uh, and...\n**Brian:** They trusted me to catch them.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. And I think that that was, um, that class culture of, you know, being encouraged to have an opinion, being encouraged to like you said, fail early, fail often. Take risks, explore, and let's evaluate together. I think that that built that sense of safe environment where when they were encouraged to, it was okay to make a mistake, it was okay to talk about it,\n**Jodie:** then that actually fostered and increased their motivation.\n**Jodie:** So we need to find, there, there are articles... and there's play. There are citations to support that as well. Exactly right. And when you feel like you're a valued member of the class and that your interactions matter,\n**Jodie:** then that does positively impact motivation. And then from there, they want to do well, they want to give a damn about the...\n**Brian:** Because I give a damn about them.\n**Jodie:** That's exactly right. So...\n**Brian:** Although we have to note that this was a cherry pick, like this was cherry-picked. This was the people who opted in. This wasn't mandatory.\n**Jodie:** That's true. Although there were a few that did it because they...\n**Brian:** Who just wanted to do the other one.\n**Jodie:** Didn't want to do the other one.\n**Brian:** Yeah. And like they muddled through and it was fine. But like Marina said, um, \"I argue, quote, I argued that the pedagogical approach of endorsing uncertainty, failure, and active experimentation facilitates epistemic humility, a deeper understanding of a given topic and empathy, drawing on the work of Singhal et al 2023. I argue that empathy is an epistemically valuable trait.\"\n**Brian:** And so, but also Russo, um, so Russo is, uh, one of the other authors in this, uh, book. Um, he makes the point that the Deweyan model, um, let me quote.\n**Brian:** So, um, uh, quote, a specific normative model of education implicitly shapes this analysis. The focus on student performance, teaching efficiency, and effectiveness as goals in themselves without considering the intellectual and moral development of the child reflects a particular interpretive framework. This perspective clearly aligns with what John Dewey critically describes as traditional education in Experience and Education. Dewey argues that this framework conceives of the goals of education as the quantitative transmission of knowledge from teacher to student, ensuring that the student develops skills useful for their future work. The key issue is that education is reduced to performance, requiring students to demonstrate their acquisition of skills and techniques in purely quantitative terms. And I think what I realized, so, look, the, this class was structured with a number of constraints ahead of time. I had to get, it was a pass/fail unit. I had to match the assessments of the larger unit so that we didn't have to go to academic Senate.\n**Brian:** So the way I structured this, although ironically, it's probably the way I would structure it again because it worked, was to test the students on their reflections because I could assess how well they reflected on their success and failure. And so for grade-oriented and traditionally risk-averse, the failure in using the tools \u2013 and this is something I drew, had as a drum beat, because they were terrified. The success or failure in using the tools was not a success or failure in the class. I didn't even care if they liked AI.\n**Brian:** I cared if they could articulate their understanding about the use in these reflections. So all of my assessments were reflections on activities because I cared what the students were thinking, not what skills they had mastered. I had an explicit rejection, now that I have these words, of the Deweyan model because, at the end of the day, this is something I've been, I've been shouting for the last 110 weeks. The emperor has no clothes. With, with where we're at, the idea that we can simply cram knowledge into students' heads with the advent of AI is wrong.\n**Jodie:** Holding that with, you did explicitly scaffold and model and teach how to prompt effectively. Oh, 100%. And so that you did handhold them and then gradually reduced your scaffolding. So like worked examples. So like explicit teaching model, things that John Hattie really is promoting in teaching. You did that as well. But it wasn't the be all end all.\n**Brian:** Well, it wasn't accessible.\n**Jodie:** It wasn't accessible. But you certainly provided that, um, depth of knowledge and understanding for them to apply, Yeah. for them to, you know, critique and evaluate. So, you know, if you look at Bloom's taxonomy, you then...\n**Brian:** Oh, I was very intentional all the way up at the top.\n**Jodie:** That's right. But you did provide that foundational support and knowledge\n**Brian:** I just didn't assess it.\n**Jodie:** to go from.\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n**Jodie:** And I guess, so that's perhaps the thing, you didn't...\n**Brian:** And look, it, this is the traditionally risk-averse, the students who are terrified, who know only how to write essays, they're going to have a bad time of this. They're going to have a bad time in university that has been haunted by AI. A lot of what I was experimenting with is how to make a university unit that not only was agnostic to AI, but welcomed it.\n**Jodie:** Right?\n**Brian:** And, and so, so this was me proving that we could move beyond the Deweyan model where experimentation and play was what I wanted and what I modeled to them. Like I, you, like you remember when I was just talking about how I used it to figure out recipes? Like I, I did not try to be the sage on the stage.\n**Jodie:** But I think though, you you were respected as the sage on the stage. Yeah, yeah. And I think quite intentionally as well. You know, you were, you were the expert, you were supportive, um, positive, enthusiastic, and you encouraged their risk taking and listened to students. So I think, like I said, that development of community of practice and valuing the student, those attributes Yeah. really impacted, like that had a huge impact on the success, your pedagogical approach. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.\n**Brian:** And so in terms of student motivation, honestly, it is rejecting the Deweyan model that what I care about is engagement, not mastery, because these things change so often.\n**Brian:** Like, I care about introspection, I care about this thoughtfulness, I care about...\n**Jodie:** You care about that it was a safe, supportive environment as well. And that environment, students were encouraged to question, Yeah. encouraged to debate and discuss and to challenge Yeah. to participate. So if they weren't sure...\n**Brian:** Like they actually did challenge me every so, like quite often.\n**Jodie:** Exactly. So that rational discourse, I think that's where it pulls back to the the theory that you, your pedagogical approach was encouraging of that, which is so different to having an approach of like, you know, I know everything, do not question me, do what I say, you know, focus on assessing perhaps lower order knowledge transmission. You know, it yeah.\n**Brian:** Yeah. Great. Cool.\n**Brian:** That was 20 minutes on one question.\n**Jodie:** All right, I'm gonna sit on the couch.\n**Brian:** So, okay."

          "extracted_content": "Okay, here is the transcription of the second part of the conversation, segmented according to the two new questions.\n\n***\n\n**(General discussion/Reflection on previous points)**\n\n**Brian:** Right, we're just going to record this, yeah.\n**Jodie:** Okay. The focus now on explicit teaching and that how that is just the be all and end all at the moment, the the latest thing. Yeah.\n**Jodie:** Uh, it that's a pedagogical approach that reduces risk for teachers Yeah in their pedagogy. So in other words, you're even a script bound Yeah by lots of things. You have to say the script and then, you know, they they say they're scaffolding like is a cognitivist approach.\n**Jodie:** And that's fine. But if you don't allow any sort of Yeah agency of students within that process of learning, then that's a dangerous thing to focus on, which is how education in Australia is going unfortunately. So a risk pedagogy, a pedagogy of, you know, like community of practice with your learners, like respecting and understanding and encouraging and evaluating and, you know, all of those higher order thinking skills. Yeah.\n**Jodie:** That's a little, you have to be prepared to take the risk and just have a go and perhaps the known unknown in your approach. You know, not everything is known known. Yeah.\n**Jodie:** And if you set yourself up to think you know known, then that's dangerous too. Because you're not actually considering the learner and their experiences and their reactions to the experience and...\n**Brian:** Yeah. And like Carpentry is explicitly explicit teaching.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** This is a script.\n**Brian:** But I don't, when I teach from the carpentries, I'm like, cool, this is going to be the stuff that I cover in this order. I'm not going to read this out loud and I'll go on digressions and I will own this content.\n**Jodie:** I mean, the same as explicit teaching provides a basis to start from. Like it... But it's dangerous to think it's the only way.\n**Brian:** Exactly. Otherwise, you just have an AI reading out to the students and not answering their questions.\n**Jodie:** And that feeds into the fear that everyone's worried about Yeah that teachers will become redundant. Yeah. So...\n**Brian:** Whereas, whereas in my experience with the carpentries, it's the exact opposite, that the valuable part of the lessons is not the script. It is when the teacher is typing stuff out into the terminal, pausing, explaining, discussing, like because the point of of the carpentries is type along where we expect the students to be typing on their computers as we're typing, getting errors. The errors are the pedagogy is one of the the refrains. And so here, it's like, cool, well, can they open the terminal? Can they type this? It's not passive, it's active.\n**Jodie:** But expecting errors then means that you as an instructor can fix them. Exactly. And that is the problem though with AI technologies because they're so unknown Yeah. that even, you know, a lot of people are fearful of like how they even work themselves. So how are you going to teach this to my students when I don't even understand the implications or or the nuances of the tech.\n**Brian:** And it's worse because how is does Macquarie expect me to teach this to more than classrooms of 30 people?\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** Like, I can't, how do I get tutors? How do we, like, how do we turn this into an Australian class versus an American?\n**Jodie:** That's true. But I the point though, I think was that you had the mindset and the willingness to be a learner with your students. Oh yeah, even though you were the expert.\n**Brian:** Well, I was an expert in the technology. I was not an expert in teaching the technology.\n**Jodie:** Hm. So what, I mean, this digresses. But what happens if you're not an expert in the technology?\n**Brian:** Oh, socks for you.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. I mean, no. So, so...\n**Brian:** Which most teachers aren't an expert in this technology yet.\n**Jodie:** So this is why the carpentries is explicit teaching.\n**Brian:** Because this is not geared for me, who's an expert in these technologies. It's geared for PhD students and postdocs who are teaching this while learning this. So this is, this, this mode of instruction, the carpentries mode, is intended for low expertise teachers.\n**Jodie:** Okay. So it's like an explicit...\n**Brian:** It is explicitly...\n**Jodie:** ...explicit model with scripts almost which is...\n**Brian:** With scripts. Explicitly. No like not not not almost. This is a script.\n**Jodie:** So you're saying that teachers it would be beneficial to have a script of like what... Oh 100%. Like if if... What are good prompts? If I was doing, well, no, no. Like if I was doing this for Macquarie, I would write it up as a carpentries lesson. Where it's like, here's your script. Here are the exercises you're going to do. Here's how you run, like, in class, here are your formative exercises. Here is your script.\n**Jodie:** So are we saying that's what's needed then for effectively teaching about AI?\n**Brian:** So if the instructors are low expertise, yes.\n**Jodie:** And that by doing actively... And by playing alongside... playing alongside... And and more to the point, like the best parts of a carpentry workshop are when the instructor gets an error and has to debug in front of their class,\n**Jodie:** because it models recovery, it models thinking through, it models triage, it models all these things. And so so long as the tutors have more experience than their class, but not that much more, then when they get into a bind and start reflecting on it, that's where the teaching comes in. Because a lot of this is modeling good behaviors and modeling the right attitudes towards\n**Jodie:** AI.\n**Brian:** Which is going to go down like a lead balloon here, but yeah.\n**Jodie:** If we're talking about school teachers too.\n**Brian:** If we're talking about teaching the unknown, the way, which is literally the title of this piece, the way we would do this to start with is through explicit teaching and in fact, breaking down the sage on a stage mentality,\n**Brian:** where the teacher has confidence because they know the exact script they're following, they know exactly what formative exercises there are. And the students have confidence because they know if they fail in the use of the technology, it doesn't mean that it's a failure in the unit.\n**Jodie:** It's a learning opportunity.\n**Brian:** It requires, uh, unfortunately, this requires us breaking the Deweyan model.\n**Jodie:** Because what's that? You didn't learn this one fact, fail. It's it's an assessment problem. And so for me, it was pass fail because then it didn't matter.\n**Jodie:** Um, if this class was not pass fail, I think it would have actually gone a very different route because then they're like, oh no, if I don't get a high distinction, it's going to ruin my grades forever.\n**Jodie:** So the fact that this was a low stakes class that encouraged them to excel not for a number, but because it was a challenge, I actually think really worked to its benefit.\n**Jodie:** We should probably talk about the questions, shouldn't we?\n**Brian:** Oh. All right.\n\n***\n\n## q1: \"You mentioned that all your assessments were reflections on activities rather than evaluations of students' mastery of AI skills. This seems central to your pedagogical approach. Could you elaborate on the specific design of these reflection assignments? What prompts or frameworks did you provide to students that helped them move from simply describing their experiences to engaging in the metacognitive analysis that you valued? And how did your assessment rubrics reinforce the value of critical reflection over technical success?\"\n\n**Brian:** You mentioned that, question one. You mentioned that all of your assessments were reflections on activities rather, okay, rather than evaluations of student mastery of AI skills. This seems central to your pedagogical approach. Could you elaborate on the specific design of those reflection assignments? What prompts or frameworks did you provide to students that helped them move from simply describing their experiences to engaging the metacognitive analysis that you valued? And how did your assessment rubrics reinforce the value of critical reflection over technical success?\n**Jodie:** Okay. Well, I think it was a twofold approach, Brian. Yeah. That there were informal prompting of yourself, but also then we started to notice within, uh, from peer-to-peer collaboration as well, um, where there were comments such as a student saying, \"Can I add a little something?\" And someone else saying, \"Maybe that's not quite right. Maybe you could ask AI to do XYZ.\" You know, um,\n**Jodie:** you know, like and you prompting students for stuff like, \"What mode are you in? Did you supply the sources to it?\" So like specific prompts um, to students about techniques that you'd sat in. So there was kind of that level of um, reflection and and prompting, which I think was different to the formal assessment type of things. So formative and summative kind of...\n**Brian:** Yeah. So my formative, okay, that's actually important. My formative assessments were quite technical.\n**Jodie:** But they were very low stakes because they weren't couched as something that they could fail at. They were couched as something like, literally every start of class, show me your prompts. That was a formative assessment.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. And then as I reflected on their prompts, that was, oh, you're not doing this, think about this, think about this, think about this. That was a failure of a formative assessment. But because there wasn't a low grade, Yeah. they didn't view it as a disspiriting thing.\n**Jodie:** And but also with your pedagogical approach. Yeah. Show me your prompts, which yes, was, you know, like activating prior knowledge, which was, you know, reinforcing your prior skills and stuff. It was also expected that everyone did contribute and, and also the way that you set up the class, like it was kind of everyone pulled their chairs around in like a semi-circle. Everyone it was, you know, focused on you and also the the social collaboration of the moment. It was there was no devices, you know, for that aspect of reflection.\n**Jodie:** Um, so, yeah, it's part of your learning design, but also they knew that you expected a response.\n**Brian:** Yeah. And that I would just let the awkward silence go.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** Um, like I, I am certainly, there are ways to do negative reinforcement in formative assessments.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. Like I could just let the awkward silence hang for a while and let them feel that nervousness.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. Like that was intentional. Yeah. Um, so like you prompted like big picture musings things like, what is the value of this class? Yeah. You know. That was week nine. Where is the purpose of incorporating AI? You know, like those philosophical kind of...\n**Brian:** Hit me.\n**Jodie:** Which was, uh, it got some really robust conversations happening, which then they fed off each other. Yes. So because...\n**Brian:** I didn't shut them down.\n**Jodie:** ...you built up a culture of respect and a community of practice, people, it became the norm to piggyback off other people's ideas and to then, you know, the conversation almost like directed itself. Yeah. So that is a pedagogical approach. 100%. That wouldn't have happened if you hadn't have established that...\n**Brian:** Designed the class culture that way.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. Yeah.\n**Brian:** Um, so for week six, so we had four assessments. And again, these assessments were dictated to us by the parent class. Sorry, this, the timing and rough topical nature was dictated by the parent class. So this is an awkward fit, but I still think it it worked fairly well. So the week six assignment, um, was their participation in the Center for Foreign Relations overcoming communism simulation. Um, and so during that in weeks three and four, so this is for the PLIR class that you have the most experience with. Um, in weeks three and four, I wanted them to use AI to help them engage in the simulation. They, it broke them out of their shells and they realized what they were doing wrong, basically. Um, so, so during the simulation, I told them to quote, use AI tools to help articulate different ideological perspectives, document your prompts and the AI's responses. So this, this idea that their prompts were what I was interested in more than the AI's responses was really important. Because then I had them do in week six, the AI output analysis, where they, I wanted them to identify biases, assumptions, and safety risk factors in the outputs, investigate whether these factors stem from the AI model or your prompting.\n**Brian:** Um, focus on biases that persist. So, so this was, this this class's theme was bias. So I, I was, I was poking them to do this. But one of the, then I had them do AI log annotation, where I wanted them to review their logs and, and this I think was the most important part of the entire class, to identify effective and ineffective prompts, and then reflect on the experience of using AI in real time during the simulation. So the best part about this was, was when, uh, student 23 in the, in the, um, transcripts, highlighted their 41 page prompt with effective and ineffective. And they were, they were tracing where their prompts caused effective and ineffective output, and where their prompts were effective and ineffective. And this was fantastic.\n**Jodie:** So, so that was, that was week six. Um, week nine was common to all of them. Um, mostly because we had a requirement for mentoring in there. Um, part of this was me riffing on Ethan Mollick's Grimoires. So one thing, and and this is where they were sharing their prompts. One thing that I did is I wanted them to all be sharing their prompts publicly in a, uh, uh, one note folder, so that everyone else could then riff on each other's prompts and use it as a baseline for experimentation. And so my week nine assignment was for them to contribute to the shared and personal Grimoire. Um, it was okay. It didn't, it didn't work as well as I wanted to. OneNote was not a good mechanism for this. Um, the idea of a Grimoire worked. Some of them really liked it. Um, I set the norm that they would mentor each other. I don't think they really did. I think that that was absolutely a, a...\n**Jodie:** Oh no, I think that during, I think that that was all part of the formative happenings of the class because I noticed comments like, um, should we do this? What do you think? Yeah. Where would this work? Did it? So those sort of comments in student groups demonstrated or provided evidence that they were asking each other, they were collaborative in their group tasks. Yes. And they did learn from each other. Like, you have a go. No, I'll try this. Or, um, you know. Yeah. Did it? Let's try it. Let's make a new scenario. Try it on your thread. Claude's not working for me. Could you add your prompt into mine? Let's see what happens. Okay. Yeah. So it is that collaborative mentoring. Yeah. So whether the the question is whether you assess that formally. No. But that to me, that was so powerful in creating this class culture and this, this we are learners together. Isn't that the big picture of what you want in learning is? So we could be have this reductionist view of oh but like Stuff the facts into the skull. You know, like that. And then how do we, you know, measure at the end whether they've got things? Oh, um, I know that's important, but...\n**Brian:** And then the, the major thing I did for this week nine is I had recorded in-class discussions where I gave them prompt, that gave, sorry, gave the humans prompts to talk about.\n**Brian:** Um, where, you know, some of the the topics that I asked, and then, and then I had each of them individually write up a reflective analysis of address the following questions using AI assisted analysis of the week nine discussion transcript. So again, it's norming AI plus. Let's be clear, some of these were, were indifferent. Um, this is, this is definitely a place where if this was graded, they would start stratifying. Mm. Uh, that's fine. Um, but like, so I asked them, identify effective uses of generative AI tools, techniques, and technologies in the unit so far, which was, is absolutely a biased question, but like I wanted them to, to go, well, what worked. And then recommend AI tools and techniques for inclusion in a first-year techniques of AI unit. So this was explicitly getting them to go, how would we teach this in a first-year unit? And then suggest AI tools and techniques for a final year Capstone with AI unit, reflect on the mentoring you've provided to teaching staff about AI teaching, that was mostly waffle, and summarize your peer mentoring that was also waffle. Um, but really it was getting them to think through the topics of a first and third year unit was very good.\n**Jodie:** And even with those questions, they chose to riff off each other. Yeah. And the discussion was then bouncing and addressed and and digressed quite significantly to their own kind of personal views of um, you know, attitude, attitudes towards AI, their change perceptions from the beginning of the unit, and how they were more critical in its use and how they felt that it really benefited them for the future doing this sort of thing. So, attitudes towards AI was quite noticeable from that um reflection, which was our previous paper kind of coded all of that. Um, Yeah. So the week 12 assessment kind of went off the rails. Um, it was going to be just running a second simulation, and then the class kind of had the idea, I think around week six, that they wanted to make their own simulation. I honestly wouldn't do it again this way. Um, I think that that asked a lot of them, and I'm not sure it, I mean, to be clear, they also succeeded in making the simulations. Like they succeeded in the task. It just, they succeeded mostly because I was there very strategically propping up one bit or the other bit Yeah. behind the scenes. Um, but effectively, this was again a reflection and debrief of how well did you use the AI to help you do this thing that you have no idea how to do? And they were applying the specific teaching that you had done throughout um and modeling and scaffolding. So it was a chance to, you know, as a, as a group, um, you know, create their simulation.\n**Brian:** And so like this reflection was very much looking at what worked and more to the point, what didn't work. And because I was asking them to talk about what worked and what didn't work, there's that, there that is the metacognitive analysis. And then last and what I think is quite interesting is for the the final assessment, I got them to write a position memo around the use of generative AI in government or education, so that they could, that I forced them to take a stand. I didn't care what stand they took, I forced them to take a stand around, all right, so now that you've used this for a semester, what is your recommendation around AI to to something? And and I think that this put a quite decent cap on on this stream of the unit.\n**Jodie:** Um, so my assessment rubrics... My assessment rubrics, um, talked about depth and analysis of their reflection rather than um facts. So like just taking, okay, let's not, let's do the week nine because that's a little bit cleaner. Like for week nine, I what were their consistent, what were their Grimoire contributions? Were they consistent, high quality, innovative? That got the best marks. Um, was their discussion participation active and insightful? That got the best marks. Was their reflective analysis comprehensive?\n**Jodie:** Like, and and then how well did they document their tool use? So, look, honestly, the rubrics kind of didn't matter because it was pass fail. Um, and and this is a place where a more innovation is necessary. But effect, but basically, I was grading them on their human tasks of annotation and reflecting. I wasn't grading them on their AI tasks. Mm mm. And that was an intentional circuit breaker so that they could fail with AI and do well in the unit. Mm mm.\n\n***\n\n## q2: \"You argue explicitly against the Deweyan model of education, critiquing its focus on the quantitative transmission of knowledge and student performance measured through clearly defined skills mastery. You position your pedagogical strategy as intentionally prioritizing reflection, epistemic humility, and community-building. However, you also mention that you provided structured and scaffolded instruction (drawing on explicit teaching methods like those championed by Hattie) to enable students to use AI effectively and confidently. Given this, could you clarify exactly how your assessment structure balances the explicit teaching and mastery of technical skills (e.g., effective AI prompting and interactions) against your explicit rejection of the Deweyan, quantitative transmission approach?\" (Including sub-questions on criteria and evidence)\n\n**Brian:** Cool. Awesome. You argue specifically, so question two, you argue specifically against the Deweyan model of education, oh, here we go, critiquing its focus on the quantitative transmission of knowledge and student performance measured through clearly defined skills mastery. You position your pedagogical strategy as intentionally prioritizing \u2013 remember, Australian, use S's, not Z's \u2013 uh, reflection, epistemic humility, and community building. However, you also mentioned that you provided structured and scaffolded instruction drawing on explicit teaching like methods like those championed by Hattie to enable students to use AI effectively and confidently. Given this, could you clarify how your assessment structure balances the explicit teaching and mastery of technical skills against your explicit rejection of the Deweyan quantitative transmission approach?\n**Brian:** Sub question one and that we've we've talked about this, uh, which is nice. What concrete criteria did you use to eval- We've talked about this. Uh, to evaluate student reflections and how did those uh criteria clearly differentiate reflective engagement from mastery of content? We've just talked about that. Um, what specific evidence or examples from student reflections do you have or plan to include demonstrating students' successful shift towards epistemic humility rather than skill, uh mere skill acquisition? Well, honestly, all the things that we were quoting in the last answer were those shifts. And so if I pull open Luke's, um, draft where uh, Can I say like, I think you've got to be careful that if you're just focusing on demonstrating explicit AI skills in a world of tech that technology that is continually changing, then that is quite like narrow-minded short-sighted. It's it's the it is what happens. So honestly, this is me reacting to how I was taught technology where I was being taught Microsoft Access in 2000, right? And like the technology that I was being taught was so outdated by the time it was, it filtered down to the classroom, that it left a really sour taste in my mouth.\n**Jodie:** So...\n**Brian:** And when it's changing every six to eight weeks, I just I just went, no, I can't teach it that way.\n**Jodie:** I mean, you but you did provide specific guidance.\n**Brian:** In formative...\n**Jodie:** As well as those big picture, you know, philosophical posing, you know, like musings, like...\n**Brian:** Yeah, I bounced between specific technical and abstract philosophical because that could engage as a textual thing these humanity students.\n**Jodie:** And also it then applies it and and goes into that higher order conceptional thinking really. So it's not just a lower order acquisition of knowledge and demonstration of skills. It's actually then applying it to your life, applying it to your your thing as university student or you know.\n**Brian:** So as as Luke said, um, oh, where does it say? I as someone, so quote, I as someone who takes immense pride in their work, was not a fan of AI and its potential implications and consequences for me as a student, as well as for incoming and future high school student and university students. However, upon reflection of my experiences on learning how to effectively use AI as a complement to modern day education and work, I came to the conclusion that my anxieties came down to one common denominator: trust. How could I attempt to place trust in a foreign concept which, prima facie, embodied all that we were taught not to do? But those anxieties arose because I was ill-informed and scared.\n**Jodie:** This case study will draw upon the importance of trust to demonstrate reality and necessity of incorporating AI as a tool within education.\n**Jodie:** Wow. So, honestly, it's this. It is they, they viewed this, and and this is Marina's thing on, um, empathy and epistemic humility. Um, this is, oh, okay. So, so Jessica was my, um, was EAP, so she's, she's from, um, Hong Kong. Um, I'll begin with my initial position, coming from Hong Kong where LMs weren't accessible, my complete lack of prior knowledge and the mixture of excitement and fear I felt, all established the context of the, uh, yeah. Um, early struggles, my anxiety and uncertainty about how to begin, language barriers I faced in learning about AI. The significant time investment to learn effective prompt writing. That is one of the major things. Um, how my English proficiency initially limited my ability to get desired results from the AI. But she then talks about how the revelations when I demonstrated effective pro- sorry, when, quote, the revelations when Professor Boston Stanton demonstrated effective prompt writing, my discovery of AI's limitations possibilities, my breakthrough when I realized that using a mixture of Chinese and English in prompts produced better results than either language alone. Right? I got her to play with this as part of my formative assessments. And I mean, look, the the way I'd say this is all these students talk about how my teaching and my modeling of effective use in formative, they don't say formative, but like in, in our formative assessments was essential. And so the explicit teaching was the formative side of things. And the Honneth metacognition, how do you be a successful citizen? How do you think about this? How do you contextualize this? was the summative side of things. So I was looking at epistemic virtues effectively for the summative side of things, and I was dealing with the technical mastery as the formative side of things.\n**Jodie:** Is actually, yeah, no, I think that's the split. That I was bouncing back and forth between these worlds. Crunch, crunch, crunch, incorporate, incorporate. Crunch, crunch, crunch, incorporate, incorporate. And it wasn't, will this be on the test next week?\n**Jodie:** Mm. So then do you argue it's not a rejection of Dewey per se?\n**Brian:** No, it absolutely is a rejection.\n**Jodie:** But you still need that skills and like explicit teaching of something, but it's the, the focus, isn't it? It's...\n**Brian:** So it is specifically a rejection of Dewey, not in a rejection of education, but, um, as Russo says, um, the key issue is that education is reduced to performance, requiring students to demonstrate their acquisition of skills and techniques in purely quantitative terms. That's where I broke.\n**Jodie:** Yeah, right. That their demonstration of acquisition of skills happened in class, in formative assessments, where I wanted them to take risks such that they failed. That is a rejection of Dewey. Dewey says failure means that you're a bad person, you should feel bad, and you have to go work in the mines.\n**Jodie:** Implicitly. Right? Or in this case, in, in, um, cafes. Right? I'm like, no, that's not okay. Your success in my class has nothing to do with how well you use AI. Your success in my class from a summative assessment perspective is how well you articulate and understand your position in regards to AI. So I had an intentional disconnect between success in using the tools and success in my class.\n**Jodie:** Mmm hmm."

          "extracted_content": "Okay, here is the transcription of the final part of the conversation, segmented according to the two questions discussed.\n\n***\n\n## q1: \"You've described creating a pedagogical environment where students could experiment, fail, and reflect without grade penalties, while still operating within the constraints of a pass/fail unit that needed to align with a parent class's assessment structure. This raises an important question: How might your pedagogical approach transfer to more traditional university contexts with graded assignments and competitive assessment structures? What specific modifications or scaffolds would be necessary to implement this 'risk pedagogy' in settings where students' GPAs and future opportunities might depend on their performance?\"\n\n**Brian:** Okay. Uh, next question. This one's Claude.\n**Brian:** You've described creating a pedagogical environment where students could experiment, fail, and reflect without grade penalties, while still operating within the constraints of a pass/fail unit that needed to align with the parents classes' assessment structure. Oh my God, that sentence. This raises an important question. How might your pedagogical approach transfer to more traditional university context with graded assignments and competitive assessment structures? What specific modifications or scaffolds would be necessary to implement this risk pedagogy in settings where students' GPAs and future opportunities might depend on their performance?\n**Brian:** So, my, my vibe for that is actually quite simple. I gave them grades in each of these assignments. There were, the reflections had rubrics.\n**Brian:** They did better and worse than each other. There was a clear marking there. Now, let's be clear, some of these I graded like a a a drunk sailor.\n**Jodie:** Mhm.\n**Brian:** Um, especially compared to my American standards because we had some other constraints. But...\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n**Brian:** I think most of the change would be getting rid of some of the wording that was compelled. Like the mentoring wording as an assessable output, I think is a bit silly.\n**Brian:** Um, and the timing would be different. Like I wouldn't have 6, 9, 12, week 6, 9, 12, 13.\n**Brian:** Um, but I actually don't think I would change much of the, for a end class, I don't think I would change much of the, you're graded on your reflections, not on your prompting. I might put one assignment on prompting to make sure that they can get outputs. But I would say I would grade more on the, can you achieve this technical thing that is well understood in a first-year class, because those are basically, were you paying attention assignments, not, did you understand assignments? Like, have you internalized it?\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n**Brian:** Um, so I still think I would lean quite heavily on reflections.\n**Jodie:** And you think about the structure where they each kind of reflective assignment built on previous knowledge and learning. Yeah. That process-based approach to assessment, Yeah. although it was ultimately pass/fail.\n**Brian:** Well, the unit was pass/fail. The assessments were not.\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n**Brian:** The assessments were fully marked.\n**Jodie:** Did they receive their...\n**Brian:** They received numerical marks and they received my comments. And, and it varied, like it wasn't clustered.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** So...\n**Jodie:** So there you go. In terms of talking about university approaches to assessments and how you can differentiate for people that need to achieve, you know, HDs on their final grades.\n**Brian:** I mean, honestly, that is easier this way because the quality of the reflection is easier to assess.\n**Brian:** Like, when I had them annotating their prompts, yeah, there was clear change difference. Some, some of them marked, like student 23 marked up her 48-page transcript with blue and purple highlighter for effective and ineffective. So when I showed everyone, some of them just did a quick reflection. So it is quite possible to look at them reflecting and the artifacts of their reflection and say, yes, this is high distinction, this is distinction, and so on and so forth.\n**Brian:** Because what this means is I don't care if your task succeeds or fails, I care if you think deeply about how you accomplished or did not accomplish it.\n**Jodie:** Mm hmm.\n**Brian:** And that's the standard, like, that can be done through rubric.\n**Jodie:** And that's what you said before about it wasn't about, yeah, the AI output per se. It was your interaction and skill development, I guess, with prompt crafting and Yeah. that that, um...\n**Brian:** And I mean, we we, what was I trying? So, if we wanted technical skills, we would make that one of the lines in the rubric of use appropriate jargon when talking about these systems.\n**Jodie:** Hm.\n**Brian:** Right? Like, bundling in basic Deweyan, have you stuffed this knowledge into your head into what amounts to a writing task.\n**Jodie:** And I think in terms of creating a culture within the classroom of being able to take a risk Yeah. in a safe environment, when you remove the, you know, like people came in not knowing about AI in the first place. When you remove that element of, oh my goodness, I'm going to be, you know, assessed and marked and graded uh on my AI knowledge. Like you just take that away and you're actually assessing kind of almost reflective ability, like reflective skills and, yeah, that's it just reduces stress, anxiety, I don't know. Yeah. Pressure.\n**Brian:** Yeah. And and I mean, making it clear that what they are assessed on are the skills that the university has taught them, which is writing.\n**Jodie:** Hm.\n**Brian:** And group collaboration. Yeah, and group collaboration and and just all all of the standard things. Yeah.\n**Jodie:** Hm.\n**Brian:** Um...\n**Brian:** Yeah, so like we have the student here, um, oh no, who said, \"I have found that, quote, I have found that AI usage is generally discouraged. This is primarily due to the belief that large language models discourages critical thinking, writing the essays of tertiary students struggling to keep up with the study work-life balance. Such a misconception continues to pervade humanities-based areas of study. Even I, a student engaging in these areas of tertiary education, erroneously believed AI was a concept inapplicable to the humanities.\" And she's a law student.\n**Jodie:** Hm mm.\n**Brian:** And so this is...\n**Brian:** Um...\n**Brian:** Making sure that they're graded on the output in the ways that they are used to, while making it clear that their engagement with this novel technology is expected, is the tension to, to, um, to do this. And I would say the scaffolds are having course, having unit learning outcomes and assessments that are designed around this rather than mapping kind of poorly to to an established unit. Um, that's the main thing. And for scaffolding, yeah, there there will need to be scaffolding. All of the students said that they there needed to be a basic skills first-year unit. Um, and and for the first-year unit, that would just be a a technical competency of this week we are covering this way of engaging with AI. Demonstrate that you can do engagement with this AI. Like, that's going to be a much more traditional unit because we're not asking them to take risks.\n**Brian:** Um, yeah, I'm happy with that.\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n\n***\n\n## q2: \"You articulate clearly that your summative assessments were intended to measure students' epistemic virtues\u2014such as epistemic humility, reflection, and trust in community\u2014rather than technical skills in using AI. However, epistemic virtues are inherently challenging to measure and evaluate consistently. To effectively argue this approach in your chapter, you'll need explicit justification and a robust theoretical basis.\" (Including sub-questions on theoretical frameworks and evidence for virtues)\n\n**Brian:** Cool. Let's see if we can do these two bullet points in six minutes.\n**Brian:** GPT 4 or 5, you articulate clearly that your summative assessments were intended to measure students' epistemic virtues such as epistemic humility, reflection, and trust in community rather than technical skills using AI.\n**Brian:** Elicit, not measure. That that's a misunderstanding. Um, however, epistemic virtues are inherently challenging to measure and evaluate consistently. Correct. To effectively argue this approach in your chapter, you will need to explicit justification or robust theoretical basis. Well, no. We're not arguing that we are measuring epistemic humility or these virtues. That we're just saying that these these were necessary virtues to have while taking the unit and to get useful output of the unit.\n**Jodie:** And also to think of as a teacher Yeah. to learning design the this whole thing Yeah. with that kind of Yeah. lens.\n**Brian:** Um, so what specific theoretical frameworks or literature will you draw on to justify your selection of these epistemic virtues as learning outcomes? They're not learning outcomes. No, this is just... this is...\n**Jodie:** But if you think about um class culture and Yeah yeah. And so so I would say that learning design. Yeah. That this is that if we try to measure them, we'll Goodhart them to death, right? Goodhart's law. When the when the thing becomes the measure, it gets perverted. Whatever Goodhart's law actually is, right? But like, you can't measure epistemic virtues. So, so we're talking about, um, Marina's uh case study here. And honestly, I will be quoting from her case study when we talk about the intentional inculcation of epistemic virtues.\n**Brian:** But no, as as as and honestly, what I was assessing in the reflections was self-awareness. That were they able to understand their interactions with these tools?\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n**Brian:** So...\n**Jodie:** Which you encouraged Oh, I learned I I encouraged having Yeah. an environment that was trusting and built on empathy. Yeah. One where So I modeled the virtues. Yeah, you could take a risk in Yeah. um...\n**Brian:** And I clearly acknowledged the virtues when they appeared.\n**Jodie:** But having that culture Yeah. meant that students could question and ask and uh and be confident to take risks and share their failures. Yes. And uh before they even submitted an assessment. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? Like that it was okay to admit that you didn't know everything or that something didn't work.\n**Brian:** Yeah. Or that changed, things changed, or there was frustrating.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** And so what I would say is, no, both of these bullets are just wrong. That I don't want to, I mean, obviously, I'll be quoting from Marina and I'll be quoting from the one that I just I pulled up. Um, because both of these are are around that level of epistemic humility, but these are certainly not learning outcomes. The, the outcome, the learning outcomes were changing the student's relationship to the technology, and more to the point, getting them to articulate a well-founded choice of where and when to use AI.\n**Brian:** So, so in the PLIR unit where the last assessment was make a policy brief, I did not dictate what that policy should be. Like I did not say that it should be pro-AI or anti-AI or anything, just that it should be articulated.\n**Brian:** And so this is growth of capability rather than the epistemic virtues.\n**Jodie:** And more evidence from the students in the week nine reflection. Um, when I asked them about reflecting on the pedagogical approach of the class, there was overwhelming agreement that they enjoyed the small group, relaxed style of the class. They liked learning to fail. Yeah. And they liked the slower pace where they could sit with their learning and apply it and have that time to mull over what was happening. Um, and yeah, sharing resources and that it was quite reflective as a unit.\n**Brian:** Yeah. So yes, um, honestly, Chat GPT, these these questions are wrong. Um, that we were quoting from one of the students talking about her growth of these epistemic virtues, but, but the, the intentional teaching of these virtues is through being a role model, not something that I can assess that, oh, you only got an 89% in humility. It's completely wrong.\n**Brian:** Um, also, you can't make that a formative or summative assessment because you can't operationalize it, you can't falsify it. So what I care about is seeing thoughts that engage with their use and failure and success in AI, not in saying, oh, I got virtue such and such when I did my homework in such and such a way, because that's just staged. And that's our time. Anything else?\n**Jodie:** No.\n**Brian:** Cool."

What particular changes in languages, language, interaction patterns or reflection quality most clearly indicated this transformation and at what point did you notice this shift?\"\n\n**Brian:** Could you elaborate on the specific behavioral indicators or evidence you observed that demonstrated students' shifts from an external AI lock where they viewed AI as having agency to an internal AI lock where they recognize their own agency in directing AI? What particular changes in languages, uh language, interaction patterns or reflection quality most clearly indicated this transformation and at what point did you notice this shift?\n**Brian:** Um,\n**Brian:** As we both scramble for references.\n**Jodie:** If you want if you if you want to, yeah.\n**Jodie:** Uh, well, I did observe changes in behavioral factors from\n**Jodie:** during over the duration of the semester. Specifically, at the start of the semester, students were quite hesitant to work independently, like um, you know, you as the instructor, Brian, were going round and and encouraging them and giving them explicit help and setting guidelines and parameters with their prompting techniques and um, you know, that sort of things. And like one student said, like, should we ask it, AI, how they're going to review this? Or, you know, what should we put into the text? And, you know, yeah. Quite at the beginning of the journey, whereas Yeah. as I went going through the semester, they were more independent, like, you know, more confident to have a go without you having to be there all the time. Yeah. So you would pop in and go, is everything okay here? Or I believe you, when they'd say everything everything's going well. I believe you. You'd say or...\n**Brian:** I mean, to be clear, I was, I was, you know, leaving a space for them to contradict me. But yeah.\n**Jodie:** Yeah. Yeah. And so, by the end, I was uh observing conversations where the students were reporting back to the class. So, confident enough to say to the class, prompt Claude, if you just put in the scenario as the first prompt as put it in the scenario as the first prompt as a system prompt, then add your character description as the user prompt, and you know, that sort of thing. So they were actively contributing to the class's knowledge. Yeah. Rather than you know what I mean? That that was the shift. At the start, they were hesitant to they didn't even really know how to take risks. And by the end, they were happy to say it in the group. But that was also class culture and that um having a safe environment. fail safe environment.\n**Brian:** Yeah. For me, I think it's when they started sharing their explorations outside of the context of the class.\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n**Brian:** Um, so like Leon, um, which we shouldn't, whatever, we'll blind it later. Um, you know, was was doing her her clothing things. And Sky's experiments with those things. And so Yeah, yeah. I mean, and and like Sky was quite early in the class. Um, but Leon didn't didn't really do much until like like week six or so. Um, my the the English as a second language person talked about her hesitation because of Hong Kong's cautious stance, educators concerns around plagiarism. We had we had a lot of plagiarism um concerns. And so, no, you know what the moment was? The moment was in the moot court. So, in in the one that you and I did, it was in the moot court when they first, when they all realized when someone started giving a speech in character, and there was this click and they all started typing. Because they were all getting speeches. And and so fundamentally, it was mimesis of each other that wasn't directed from me. Right? That that they they realized that a thing was possible and beneficial to them, and that it was licit and allowed.\n**Jodie:** So a socio-constructivist approach to learning.\n**Brian:** And and I think also that week nine reflection where they sat around and Yeah, the class environment was structured so that everyone was equal. They were not hidden behind desks or anything.\n**Jodie:** And I think definitely by week six, because also just thinking about it, because what punctured their faith in the goodness of it was um, one of them said something and and one of the other students made, you know, the eagle an eagle calling sound because it was like this hyper-patriotic thing. And you know, it was it was it wasn't it wasn't a mockery of the other student, it was a mockery of the speech. It was like, and and and what that did is it punctured that the the thought that AI was good. Like, you know, in the sense that that AI had authority over them. So it was almost letting the air out of the bubble that increased their autonomy because they realized that it wasn't a magical answer engine that they still had to engage their brains.\n**Jodie:** Mm.\n**Brian:** And then of course, the week six assignment where they had to reflect on what was effective and not effective certainly worked.\n**Jodie:** So the metacognitive strategies, uh reflection and that self-regulated learning aspect where they reflected and then and then modified their practice, which is part of self-regulation self-regulated learning where you can monitor your learning process.\n**Brian:** So, yeah. And I think a lot of them saw this because they were sharing, like I made a space for them to share prompts and made it graded. Um, and so I think that they saw and started copying each other's prompts. That was important.\n**Jodie:** Right.\n**Brian:** Um, just thinking about the other classes here. So in the philosophy, okay, what did what did what did Jessica say? So her initial struggles, vague prompts often led to an irrelevant or unhelpful outputs, language barriers made it difficult to articulate needs in English, breakthroughs, code switching, mixing English and Chinese in prompts helped improve clarity and results. And so, so it's it's when they discovered how to get useful things to them.\n**Jodie:** And by constructivist pedagogical approach. Hey, it wasn't you saying this is the prompt. You try. You gave scaffolds and help and give guidance.\n**Brian:** I mean, I like I was sitting with that that the...\n**Jodie:** But ultimately she came up. Yeah. Is that correct? That with a little...\n**Brian:** I mean, well...\n**Jodie:** You guided her.\n**Brian:** She came to the conclusion I wanted her to come to.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** Right? But but like, here's the thing, she framed it as a breakthrough in her recollection. So she felt that she earned it.\n**Jodie:** Right. So in terms of pedagogical approach, because that's what this paper is about. Yeah. It's you did do the scaffolding and the explicit why and how.\n**Brian:** Actually, and so what I what I told her to do is try try it in English, or try it in in Chinese. And so then she worked out how to make it useful.\n**Jodie:** Mm. Mm. So giving space for that.\n**Brian:** Yeah, giving space for that.\n**Jodie:** And giving reflection and spending the time on it.\n**Brian:** Yes. And reflection is huge part of that. Yeah. So... Um... But also, I think... And it was personalized to their context because that student was dealing with, you know, Chinese and English as the...\n**Jodie:** So for changes in language, I think this is where they started adopting my jargon.\n**Brian:** Yes.\n**Jodie:** Where where before it was AI, and after it was LLM. After they were talking about prompts, and system prompts, and user prompts, and they were talking about models, and that their under their granularity of understanding changed. I didn't test them on this. I echoed this towards them.\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n**Jodie:** Um, and interaction patterns, their prompts got longer.\n**Brian:** But also their collaborative efforts got longer too.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** Because there was that class culture of fail safe environment and let's co-construct with each other and peer collaborations, group assignments, you know, that, you know, socio-constructivist approach.\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n**Jodie:** Okay.\n**Brian:** Yeah. And at what point? Honestly, I would say for PLIR, I managed to get it at the start of the semester when I got them to do silly system prompts. But I think they got it during the simulation because they were on on stage, like they weren't on stage, but like they were performing in a different venue and it was out of their comfort zone and they were taking the persona of these 1940s people. And then, um, Francesca gave her the Dorothy, the the racist conservative one. And and I think it clicked because there was there was this tension in the air. Now I'm just thinking about it. There was this tension of, oh, you can't get it to say that. Like it's it's the most mild transgressions, but the fact that she got it to transgress, made them go, oh. Right? Like it was it was it was that kind of oh. Um, the ancient history class, they just trucked along. Like they were troopers. It was definitely the most traditional of the classes. Um, they were also really good students, so that it was it was, I gave them space to work and they just they got to it. Um... I think definitely that um... I don't know, the language...\n**Jodie:** There was there was real language change, but there was...\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n**Jodie:** There was also when to turn to it change? Because like looking at their prompts, they started using it for other purposes.\n**Brian:** Yeah, yeah.\n**Jodie:** Now, I didn't see that until the end of the semester when I asked for all their prompts. But they grew comfortable around the the limits of it.\n**Brian:** But they shared what they'd used it for with, you know, show me your prompts at the start of each lesson. So there was starting remember that...\n**Jodie:** And and and there was that whole...\n**Brian:** This picture one...\n**Jodie:** ...that they were assessing.\n**Brian:** Yes. That's right. And the student that asked Yeah. asked it for ideas for its marketing campaign for their music or something like that.\n**Jodie:** Critiqued it. Yeah. Yeah.\n**Brian:** It was um... And and someone else who wanted had had a friend who was unwell and Yeah. gave it some ideas for gifts.\n**Jodie:** And these are all trivial examples, but they were trivial examples that were supplied by the students that I acknowledged with attention.\n**Brian:** And they reflected on their own...\n**Jodie:** Yeah.\n**Brian:** It's they weren't even positive all the time.\n**Jodie:** Yeah, yeah.\n**Brian:** Like they were disappointed with the output. And then, ah, they were disappointed with the output, and then they we started talking about why they were disappointed. So it wasn't viewing the AI as an edifice that you merely can have one emotion to. It's viewing the prompt as a series of levers that you can control to...\n**Jodie:** Yeah. Yeah.\n**Brian:** Yes. And and it is... And how would you do it differently? You know? Oh yeah, that's a good idea. And not by the end, the change for that was that by the end of the semester, everyone was able to bounce these ideas was bouncing this...\n**Jodie:** How they could have made it more effective. Whereas in the beginning it was just you Yeah. giving like the feedback as the...\n**Brian:** Modeling, yeah.\n**Jodie:** As the expert. Yeah.\n**Brian:** Yeah.\n\n***\n\n## q2: \"In your current pedagogical approach, you emphasize epistemic humility, critical reflection, and risk-taking over the quantitative mastery of technical AI skills. How does this emphasis on reflective and risk pedagogies specifically impact students' Locus of Control (LOC) in relation to AI, and how might this connect with your previously documented findings on the plasticity and development of AI-LOC through structured, reflective instruction?\"\n\n**Brian:** Okay dokey.\n**Brian:** In your, Oh God. In your current pedagogical approach, you emphasize epistemic humility. No, one of my students emphasizes epistemic humility, you bucket of bolts. Critical reflection and risk taking. Okay, that that is fair. I do emphasize those. Over the uh quantitative mastery of technical AI skills. Fair. How does this ash, I should not have that in the transcript. Oh well. How does this emphasis on reflective and risk pedagogies specifically impact student locus of control in relation to AI? And how might this connect with your previously documented findings on the plasticity and development of AI lock through structured reflective instruction?\n**Jodie:** You're so bucket of bolts.\n**Brian:** That sure is a bunch of words. What is it asking?\n**Jodie:** Okay. Well, by allowing and actually specifically planning for that pedagogical approach of reflective learning and Yeah. and being able to take a risk and giving space and time in a lesson to take a risk and apply, then Yeah. they that gave them time and space Yeah. to then be able to discuss that locus of control issue and to be able to sit in that awkward and be able to really unpack how and whether they felt they retained agency and how they did retain agency. And you know what I mean? Yeah. So, yeah. Time was a huge...\n**Brian:** Yes. And and honestly, the the parallel there is in humanities classes, we have classes that are fact-based, right? That you you pack students' heads full of knowledge and you expect them to regurgitate. But we also have classes that are practice-based. Creative arts, where it's, no, no, go master the skill. And I think, treating this as almost quite literally an art, where it's practice and repetition and feedback and risk and failing and practice and repetition and feedback, is how I did it.\n**Jodie:** Rather than a set of specific design skills that tick off and Yeah. master.\n**Brian:** Yeah. Because because by the end, the class was delivering a project that they creatively created, not... And all of them, like all of them did, right? The the 160 item bibliography was an output. So therefore, that learning design aspect of how to I guess plan and design your lessons or even unit of work, it's not so much that they've got to do this type of prompt, they've got to do...\n**Jodie:** Like the curriculum in Australia and New Zealand and most places around the world.\n**Brian:** Yeah. I have a story that I need to recommend to you when we're not on tape. Um... Um, and so, whereas... Mm. Yes. I think... So, for... Based learning.\n**Jodie:** It is 100% inquiry based, but it's personalized. So I met my students where they were. I didn't expect them to master some corpus. Um, that that, I mean, this is the problem with me trying to figure out how to teach other people to teach this, is go up and vibe. Like, I I am increasingly of the opinion that I treat this almost purely as an art, underpinned by a great deal of technical knowledge that I have, that I've certainly lectured on and they got whatever they got from those lectures and then and discarded the rest. But the thing is is that my lectures in terms of the technical content were useful only by virtue of space repetition. That I had the drum beats that I wanted and I made sure to keep bringing them up over and over week after week, not, here's the knowledge, it's in your head now. Um, so so in terms of reflective, it is there needs to be space to fail and there needs to be time to fail. And above all else, the reflections have to be respected. Because it is the and critiqued, like the reflections matter to a degree, like normally reflections are there because the teachers want some sort of vibe from the students, they want some sort of evidence that of engagement. No, like normally reflections are not treated as serious things. They're not. Like okay...\n**Jodie:** But the point is usually because it's rushed and at the end...\n**Brian:** Because it's rushed, because it's tokenized or or even more to the point, you don't have enough space in your grading budget. If a reflection's 20%, that means any given weekly reflection's two. Right? It's used as a proxy for participation. It's used as a pulse check. Whereas for me, the reflection was the point. And like reflection to whom, by whom? And and I definitely aimed the mirror in a bunch of different ways. Reflect to me, reflect on your prompts, reflect to each other. Like I I was very intentional about aiming the reflection. Um, but it is a spiral design where you keep orbiting around a concept. I don't know why I'm drawing in the air, the AI can't see it. Um, whatever. You know what I mean? And and and it's it is starting with the core of the thing, making sure that they had the basic skill of get words into AI, get words out of AI, and then always returning to a few touchstones as they looked at themselves playing.\n**Jodie:** Mmm. Mm hmm.\n**Brian:** Sure."

Integrates both theoretical frameworks (Transformative Learning Theory and the Rumsfeld Matrix) that you discussed\n2. Captures your core pedagogical approach of decoupling successful AI use from assessment success\n3. Emphasizes the development of internal AI-LOC through risk pedagogy and reflection\n4. Incorporates your observations of student transformation over the 13-week course\n5. Details the specific behavioral and language changes that indicated shifts in student agency\n6. Follows an academic structure with claims, evidence, and warrants at the sub-paragraph level\n\nThe outline is structured to highlight your rejection of the Deweyan model in favor of a reflective, risk-embracing approach that prioritizes epistemic virtues over technical mastery.\n\nSome key components I've emphasized based on your conversations:\n- The importance of time (8+ weeks) for cultural development\n- The \"Show me your prompts\" ritual as central to community building\n- The metacognitive emphasis in assessment design\n- The specific indicators of shifting from external to internal AI-LOC\n- The philosophical implications of treating AI education as liberal arts rather than technical training\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular section, or would you like to suggest any modifications to the structure or emphasis of the outline?",
