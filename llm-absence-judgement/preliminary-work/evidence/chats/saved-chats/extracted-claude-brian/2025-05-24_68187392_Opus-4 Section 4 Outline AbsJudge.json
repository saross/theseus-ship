Follow your critique of marketing terminology\n2. Precede your discussion of the agency spectrum (task-decomposing \u2192 goal-following \u2192 goal-setting)\n3.

Let me look at the structure of that section from the document:\n\nSection 2.2 covers:\n- Taxonomies of Agency versus Current Marketing Claims\n- Agency vs. Task Decomposition (2.2.1)\n- Three Dimensions of AI Judgment Deficiency (2.2.2)\n  - Epistemic Humility\n  - Inductive and Abductive Reasoning\n  - Correspondence with Reality\n\nThe snippet would fit well in the \"Agency vs. Task Decomposition\" subsection, particularly after they establish the disconnect between marketing claims and actual capabilities. It could work either:\n1. After discussing OpenAI's marketing claims about Deep Research\n2. As a bridge between discussing the limited capabilities and introducing their own framework\n3. Near where they discuss \"task-decomposing systems\"\n\nLooking at the content, it seems like it would fit best after they've established that current systems are task-decomposing rather than truly agentic, as it provides industry acknowledgment of this minimal definition.",

That would be valuable evidence to include or reference more specifically in your paper to demonstrate the gap between its proposed capabilities and actual performance.\"\n\nLet's keep going on this line, since I think we need to synthesise multiple aspects of our current conversation and I'm not persuaded we're clear.\n\nI'm also getting worried that we're reaching the length limits of this chat, so let's consider what we need to do before we can achieve the outline, please.",

          "extracted_content": "Hi DR. Today we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper. \n\n# Ground rules\n\nABOVE ALL ELSE, if you are unsure about something, or do not have evidence from a web page supporting a claim, do not make a claim. If there is any doubt, there is no doubt.\n\nThis is research. SPEND EXTRA TIME above and beyond normal, to collect data carefully and methodically. We don't care about how long it takes, only that your research is accurate and epistemologically grounded. Care and attention to detail second only to the prior rule.\n\n# Definitions\n\n## Tool definition\nFor our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software\u2014be it a program, script, or web application\u2014that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets\u2014without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement\u2014are excluded. \n\nIn essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.\n\nIt is our belief that the tools we have given you meet this criteria, however, if there is an absence of evidence supporting our belief, it is REQUIRED that you inform us of any problems. IF YOU ARE UNSURE, INDICATE IT rather than giving an answer.\n\n# Task\n\nI will be giving you the name or acronym of an archaeology and historical studies-related software tool which dates somewhere from 1995 onwards. \n\nYou must build a well-formed quoted CSV inside a fenced code block with the following columns:\ncsv\n\"Tool\", \"Year\", \"Source\", \"URL\", \"AI Notes\"\n\n* Tool is our key column. It is essential to be consistent in tool name, following the input we give you. If there is an issue indicate it in notes.\n* Year, year from the web page, article, or source you found, n.d. is a valid entry for \"no date\"\n* Source: Citation or (Domain + Page Title)\n* URL, url of the resource. \n* AI notes: any notes, concerns, or uncertainties you have with the data provenance or quality. Do not use HTML citations.\n\nThis is a comprehensive and systematic search. For each year, 1995 onwards, we one mention (one line) per source found. Obviously, many of these tools were created after 1995, so we'll want to expand our search by +- 1 year from any date we find. When you find a source, systematically explore adjacent years in your searches.\n\nDO NOT extrapolate dates from sources. ONLY include dates where a source has been published in that year. We will perform all necessary inference, if you include a line for EACH valid source you find. For undated items, indicate \"n.d.\"\n\nThis research requires that you be thoughtful, systematic, and take your time. You will likely need to visit EVERY SINGLE PAGE of search results for a given tool. \n\nTo repeat back.\n\nI'm going to give you a list of tools, one by one.\nYou will search for them.\nFor every source you find,  we want to record tool, year/n.d., source (citation or title), and url\n\nYou MUST build a CSV with the output in your direct response to the deep research process.\n\nAllowed sources: \n* Do try to find it's source code in published version control repos (add a row if they have public code, as the commits will have dates)\n* do try to find scholarly literature (each to one row)\n* do include blog posts and about pages (each to one row)\n* do include any other mentions of the tool (each to one row)\n\nWhen you respond with data:\nRESULTS: Build a markdown **fenced code block** CSV of evidence you have found with  ANY mention of that tool in ANY year/n.d. should be on the CSV, regardless of source. Include one line for EACH source you find. Do not include any inline citations automatically generated by the deep research process (i.e., AI-generated or system-injected references i.e. \u3010deep research\u3011 or &#8203;:contentReference[oaicite). \n\nDo you understand?\n"

            "content": "# Section 4: Case Studies of AI Research Tools\n\n## 4.0 Introduction\n- Brief overview of tools evaluated and assessment methodology\n- Clarification that evaluations represent a \"snapshot in time\" (February-March 2025)\n- Emphasis on both capabilities and judgment deficiencies\n\n## 4.1 OpenAI's Suite of Tools\n\n### 4.1.1 Claimed Capabilities\n- Deep Research marketing promises (\"agentic\" capabilities)\n- Technical architecture (search integration, context handling)\n- Positioning as a comprehensive research assistant\n\n### 4.1.2 Observed Limitations\n\n#### 4.1.2.1 Epistemic Humility Failures\n- **Example**: Dramatic overestimation of capabilities in initial prompt engineering\n  - Seven-stage research plan that couldn't be executed in a single prompt\n  - Required seven iterations to achieve basic CSV output\n  - Disconnect between proposed capabilities and actual performance\n- **Example**: O3 model falsely claiming Python execution abilities\n  - Presenting \"simulated\" output rather than acknowledging limitations\n  - Prioritizing appearance of competence over truthfulness\n\n#### 4.1.2.2 Technoscholastic Tendencies\n- **Example**: Digital Humanities in Australia research case\n  - University of Newcastle Centre for 21st Century Humanities presented as active\n  - Failure to recognize temporal context (Burrows' work from 1980s described without timeframe)\n  - Missed critical signals (death notice of center leader, discontinued updates)\n  - Prioritized institutional domain authority (.edu.au) over content assessment\n- Lack of critical assessment of source credibility and currency\n- Absence of historiographical awareness (when claims were made, by whom, for what purpose)\n\n#### 4.1.2.3 Data Collection Issues\n- Inconsistent date recognition (GitHub examples)\n- Confabulation of nonexistent tools\n- Lack of systematic source examination\n- Context window management problems\n\n### 4.1.3 Effective Applications\n- Dataset preparation when properly scaffolded\n- Literature survey capabilities (with human judgment integration)\n- Comparative strengths between O1 Pro, O3, and GPT-4.5\n\n## 4.2 Anthropic's Offerings\n\n### 4.2.1 Claimed Capabilities\n- Claude 3.7 reasoning capabilities for deeper analysis\n- Anthropic Research feature (multi-agent architecture)\n- Constitutional AI approach and its impacts on research quality\n- Writing quality positioned as more \"humane and erudite\"\n\n### 4.2.2 System Architecture and Behavior\n- Multi-agent approach (consistently creates four sub-agents)\n- Search methodology (many web_search calls, fewer page fetches)\n- Context management (adding search snippets to sub-agent windows)\n- Hard-coded output constraints:\n  - Always produces reports with \"hyperbolic titles\"\n  - Refuses to follow requested output formats (e.g., won't produce CSVs)\n\n### 4.2.3 Observed Limitations\n\n#### 4.2.3.1 Judgment Deficiencies\n- **Example**: Digital Humanities in Australia assessment\n  - Western Sydney University case (course offered once in 2020 presented as ongoing)\n  - Failure to recognize temporal context of announcements\n  - No investigation of \"useful absences\" of evidence\n- Sub-agents run as \"singular threads\" without cross-checking\n- No evidence of source critique or self-criticism\n- High rates of confabulation in literature reviews\n\n#### 4.2.3.2 Technoscholastic Tendencies\n- Takes search inputs and \"vibes\" on them without critical assessment\n- Produces \"implausibly cheery, implausibly positive perspectives\" on topics\n- Accepts announcements as \"temporal evidence of the thing itself\"\n- No investigation of whether named personnel still work at institutions\n- No recognition of discontinuation unless explicitly announced\n\n### 4.2.4 Effective Applications\n- More \"conscientious\" than OpenAI's Deep Research (less thread wandering)\n- Better than Gemini's Deep Research despite Google's search advantage\n- Works well for code-related tasks (e.g., Git scraper development)\n- Higher quality writing style (more \"humane and erudite\")\n- Maintains better quality floor and \"vibe following\" than competitors\n\n## 4.3 Google's Research Tools\n\n### 4.3.1 Technical Architecture\n- Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research implementation approach\n- Single-threaded processing (versus multi-agent approaches)\n- Integration with Google's search infrastructure\n- Lack of Google Scholar integration despite Google ownership\n\n### 4.3.2 Observed Limitations\n\n#### 4.3.2.1 \"Stamp Collecting\" Approach\n- **Example**: Digital Humanities research showing \"ultimate Carnapian confirmation\"\n  - Collects massive numbers of hits without detailed examination\n  - Produces surface-level summaries from individual sources\n  - Extrapolates broad statements from single papers without triangulation\n- \"Shotgun mass-summary\" methodology versus focused source analysis\n\n#### 4.3.2.2 Technoscholastic Tendencies\n- **Example**: Undergraduate-level source aggregation\n  - Building uncritical narratives atop unquestioned source claims\n  - No critical assessment of temporality (same Digital Humanities failures)\n  - Processing sources in blocks of 20-50 without individual scrutiny\n- Higher proportion of confabulated sources than competitors\n- Lower quality source identification despite search advantage\n\n### 4.3.3 Design Limitations\n- Lacks sufficient \"space\" to double-check findings\n- No source-by-source engagement\n- Limited by fundamental architecture choices\n- Significantly underperformed compared to Claude Research in annotated bibliography tasks\n\n## 4.4 Hugging Face's Open Deep Research\n\n### 4.4.1 Technical Approach and Infrastructure\n- Open-source implementation with filesystem access\n- Integration with user-specified search APIs\n- Ability to run operations from local university computer\n- Extension potential through model context protocol\n\n### 4.4.2 Resource Requirements and Limitations\n- Significant expense ($200 in o1-pro credits for a single run)\n- Limited testing due to prohibitive costs\n- Potential need for dynamic model selection per query\n\n### 4.4.3 Practical Applications\n- **Example**: CSV iteration for Open Archaeology tools description enhancement\n- Promise for structured data workflows\n- Continues tool-using vs. goal-following pattern\n\n## 4.5 Other Tools\n\n### 4.5.1 OpenAI's Operator\n- Technical demonstration without practical utility\n- Failure to decompose tasks or maintain context\n- Inability to execute even simple data collection tasks\n- Future potential for browser navigation as user agent\n\n### 4.5.2 Anthropic's Computer Use\n- Docker container approach for local program access\n- Excessive resource consumption (API credit costs)\n- Inability to complete simple document retrieval tasks\n- Technical promise hampered by practical limitations\n\n### 4.5.3 Elicit Research Report\n- Conceptually superior paper selection and evaluation steps\n- Hamstrung by reliance on Semantic Scholar\n- Model quality limitations affecting performance\n- Flawed paper discovery and winnowing process\n\n### 4.5.4 Perplexity Research\n- Search query optimization focus\n- Superficial digestion of limited sources\n- Sub-par model choice affecting output quality\n- Technoscholasticism in source handling (no triangulation or critical assessment)\n\n## 4.6 Comparative Analysis\n- Cross-system patterns in judgment deficiencies\n- Varying manifestations of technoscholasticism\n- Technical vs. epistemological limitations\n- Framework for selecting appropriate tools based on research needs",

Scope/Confabulation Relationship  \n% - All models do same \"amount\" of work regardless of task scope\n% - Narrower scope = higher quality (less confabulation)\n% - Broader scope = quality dilution and increased confabulation\n% - Implications for prompt engineering and task design\n\n% 3. Temporality Blindness\n% - Systematic across all models\n% - Not just missing dates, but lacking temporal reasoning\n% - Cannot infer from \"useful absences\" (no updates = likely defunct)\n% - Treats all web content as eternally present\n\n% 4. Stamp-Collecting vs Systematic Evaluation\n% - Random walk with \"vague Carnapian confirmatory bias\"  \n% - Collect evidence until internal \"vibe threshold\" met\n% - No revisiting or cross-checking sources\n% - Elicit's structure shows this isn't inevitable, just poorly executed\n\n% 5. Willison Quote Integration\n% - \"Agents are models using tools in a loop\" (Anthropic definition)\n% - Even this minimal definition not met by current implementations\n% - Single-pass execution rather than true loops with evaluation\n\n% 6. Mundane Utility Patterns\n% - Inverse relationship: judgment requirement \u2194 utility\n% - Best performance on mechanical, low-judgment tasks\n% - Worst on open-ended synthesis requiring evaluation\n% - Implications for research workflow integration",

The paper's core thesis is that AI tools lack three crucial dimensions of judgment: epistemic humility, inductive capacity, and correspondence with reality. We characterize these tools as exhibiting \"technoscholasticism\"\u2014privileging textual authority over critical assessment of knowledge claims.\n\nI've completed a detailed outline (attached) with specific evidence mapped to each tool. Key insights from our planning:\n\n1. **Core finding**: Inverse relationship between judgment requirements and utility. Tools perform well on mechanical tasks but fail when judgment is needed.\n\n2. **Pattern across all tools**: \"Stamp-collecting\" behavior\u2014random walk through sources with vague Carnapian confirmatory bias until internal \"vibe threshold\" met. No systematic evaluation or revisiting sources.\n\n3. **Architectural vs Epistemic failures**: \n   - Architectural: single-threaded, can't escape context window, can't maintain state\n   - Epistemic: won't recognize need to decompose, won't evaluate own output, lack temporality awareness\n\n4. **Specific evidence patterns**:\n   - OpenAI: Seven-stage plan \u2192 DH temporality failures \u2192 data collection success (with heavy scaffolding)\n   - Anthropic: Strong on narrow tasks, confabulates at scale, \"vibes\" on search results\n   - Google: \"Ultimate Carnapian confirmation,\" processes 20-50 sources at once without scrutiny\n   - All tools: Technoscholastic acceptance of institutional claims, temporality blindness\n\n5. **Key examples**: \n   - Digital Humanities in Australia (all tools presented defunct programs as active)\n   - Western Sydney offered one course in 2020, presented as ongoing program\n   - University of Newcastle centre with death notice presented as vibrant\n   - Tools can't infer from \"useful absences\" of evidence\n\n**Writing requirements**: Follow style guide (Australian spelling, active voice, 2-3 sentence units). NO empty praise or compliments. Be critical and specific. Ask pointed questions. Evidence-based writing drawing from transcripts.\n\n**Current task**: Write Section 4 following the outline structure. Each tool section should demonstrate specific judgment failures while noting where mundane utility was found. Maintain consistent implicit template across tools without explicit labeling.\n\nPlease begin by reviewing the outline and asking any specific clarifying questions needed before we start writing the introduction paragraph.\n\n---\n```\nViewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn\u2019t yet supported on mobile.\n```\n\nI've created a comprehensive prompt and an artifact with key notes. The prompt captures:\n- The paper context and thesis\n- Key insights and patterns we discovered\n- Specific evidence and examples\n- Writing requirements and style\n- The current task\n\nThe artifact provides a quick reference for:\n- The analytical framework\n- Specific evidence by tool\n- Key examples that demonstrate patterns\n- Writing style reminders\n- The implicit template structure\n- Important quotes and insights\n\nThis should give them everything needed to resume effectively in a new thread.I've created both a comprehensive resumption prompt and an artifact with our key notes and evidence. The prompt captures our analytical insights, specific evidence patterns, and writing requirements. The artifact serves as a quick reference for the judgment framework, specific examples, and writing guidelines.\n\nThe prompt emphasizes:\n- The inverse relationship between judgment and utility\n- Specific failure patterns for each tool\n- The critical, evidence-based approach needed\n- The architectural vs epistemic distinction we developed\n\nIs there anything specific from our conversation that you feel needs stronger emphasis in either the prompt or the notes artifact?",

          "text": "Here's a comprehensive prompt for resuming in a new thread:\n\n---\n\nI'm writing Section 4 (Case Studies of AI Research Tools) of my paper \"An Absence of Judgment: AI's Limitations in Deep Research tasks\". The paper's core thesis is that AI tools lack three crucial dimensions of judgment: epistemic humility, inductive capacity, and correspondence with reality. We characterize these tools as exhibiting \"technoscholasticism\"\u2014privileging textual authority over critical assessment of knowledge claims.\n\nI've completed a detailed outline (attached) with specific evidence mapped to each tool. Key insights from our planning:\n\n1. **Core finding**: Inverse relationship between judgment requirements and utility. Tools perform well on mechanical tasks but fail when judgment is needed.\n\n2. **Pattern across all tools**: \"Stamp-collecting\" behavior\u2014random walk through sources with vague Carnapian confirmatory bias until internal \"vibe threshold\" met. No systematic evaluation or revisiting sources.\n\n3. **Architectural vs Epistemic failures**: \n   - Architectural: single-threaded, can't escape context window, can't maintain state\n   - Epistemic: won't recognize need to decompose, won't evaluate own output, lack temporality awareness\n\n4. **Specific evidence patterns**:\n   - OpenAI: Seven-stage plan \u2192 DH temporality failures \u2192 data collection success (with heavy scaffolding)\n   - Anthropic: Strong on narrow tasks, confabulates at scale, \"vibes\" on search results\n   - Google: \"Ultimate Carnapian confirmation,\" processes 20-50 sources at once without scrutiny\n   - All tools: Technoscholastic acceptance of institutional claims, temporality blindness\n\n5. **Key examples**: \n   - Digital Humanities in Australia (all tools presented defunct programs as active)\n   - Western Sydney offered one course in 2020, presented as ongoing program\n   - University of Newcastle centre with death notice presented as vibrant\n   - Tools can't infer from \"useful absences\" of evidence\n\n**Writing requirements**: Follow style guide (Australian spelling, active voice, 2-3 sentence units). NO empty praise or compliments. Be critical and specific. Ask pointed questions. Evidence-based writing drawing from transcripts.\n\n**Current task**: Write Section 4 following the outline structure. Each tool section should demonstrate specific judgment failures while noting where mundane utility was found. Maintain consistent implicit template across tools without explicit labeling.\n\nPlease begin by reviewing the outline and asking any specific clarifying questions needed before we start writing the introduction paragraph.\n\n---",

What we attempted (research stages)\n2. Architectural constraints observed\n3. Epistemic failures manifested  \n4. Where mundane utility found\n\n### Transitions Needed\n- Between major sections (%TODO markers)\n- From Section 3 methodology \u2192 Section 4 evidence\n- From Section 4 evidence \u2192 Section 5 analysis\n\n## Scope/Confabulation Insight\n\"It will generally do the same amount of effort in any given task, and it's up to us to zoom in and out until the scope of the task is appropriate for the LLM at hand.\"\n\n## Willison Quote Context\n\"Agents are models using tools in a loop\" - Even this minimal definition not met, as tools do single-pass stamp collecting rather than iterative evaluation.",
