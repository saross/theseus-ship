There seems to be an issue about search scope or parameters:\n   - Something about 64 issues\n   - A suggestion that starting from issue 1 would have been better\n   - A need to rerun some searches\n\n2. An important observation about operational limitations:\n   - The system follows instructions but not necessarily in the most efficient way\n   - There's something about it not being properly \"operationalized\"\n\n3. A key point about sustained attention:\n   - The system cannot \"stay on task for a sustained period\"\n   - This relates to your earlier points about it not being truly agentic\n   - You mentioned something about it being \"in the unhanded balance\"\n\nWould you mind clarifying some of these points, particularly about the operational aspects and what specific search issue you encountered? This seems like it could be another concrete example of the system's limitations.\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about why this research hasn't been done previously - could you elaborate on that point?",
