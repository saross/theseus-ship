          "extracted_content": "Digital Humanities SWOT analysis \n\n(Research experiment using perplexity.ai https://www.perplexity.ai/collections/DH-SWOT-prep-QRBYe_QaSo6LiEXObetJag?s=c) \n\n \n\nObjective: Understand and operationalise how universities across the world use the term \u201cDigital Humanities\u201d in terms of their centres, undergraduate and graduate offerings, labs, and research support services. \n\n \n\nHot wash: DH is poorly operationalised. It may be any or all of: \n\nCorpus linguistics \n\nDigital Cultures \n\n\u201cBig Data\u201d \n\nGLAM preparation (plus magical technology) \n\nWebsites and New Media \n\nKCL describes their department as all of the above: \u201cThe Department of Digital Humanities is a global leader in researching digital culture and society, and in exploring the use of advanced technology-related methods in humanities research.\u201d1 notably offering \u201cDigital Culture\u201d as their only undergraduate degree.  \n\nIn contrast, if we look at ANU, their \u201cSchool of Cybernetics\u201d offers: \u201cCybernetics is the science of control and communication in complex systems such as computers, the human body, ecological systems, information systems, government and human cultures.  \u2026  It was a way of thinking about how to build autonomous machines and \u2018intelligent\u2019 computing systems. It looked to processes in nature, and social systems, ... [and thus] generated ways of understanding how complex systems steer towards a goal, through interacting parts of a system that can sense, act, and respond to one another.\u201d 2  \n\nWhereas JLU (with whom we have a close relationship) says: \u201cDigital Humanities (also e-Humanities and Computing in Humanities , i.e. \u201cdigital humanities\u201d) is an interdisciplinary research area at the interface between the humanities and computer science. The subject of Digital Humanities involves the application of computer-based methods to work with digital resources such as text, audio and video. The aim of Digital Humanities is the differentiated and complex preparation and analysis of these resources, as well as ensuring their sustainable use.\u201d3  \n\nWhereas Western Sydney University says: \u201cDigital Humanities is an emerging field of inter-disciplinary study. It involves the application of digital techniques and computational analysis to the sorts of research questions traditionally asked by scholars in the humanities disciplines.\u201d But then shows their hand when they list the available jobs as \u201cGLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives or museums), \u2026 [and] The technology sector (e.g. social media and web design)\u201d4 \n\nA look at the DH2023 conference5 shows the same incoherence. Workflows, SPARQL queries, text analysis, cultural analysis, the semantic web, Natural Language Programming, web archives \u2013 while all very personally interesting, shows the fundamental \u201cmultidisciplinary\u2019 (read: distracted) nature of the field.  \n\nIt\u2019s digital humanities if it contains computers and \u201cthe humanities\u201d (broadly conceived). The choice of technical and theoretical dial settings comes from the power plays and politics involved. JLU (Giessen) has an extreme emphasis on corpus linguistics due to the academic discipline of its President, Mukherjee (now at Cologne). ANU has cybernetics because of Professor Bell. KCL\u2019s DH department was \u201c... started as the 'Centre for Computing in the Humanities' in 1992.\u201d And brought that \u201chypermedia\u201d multidisciplinary big-tent focus forward. Even so, \u201c... [the] Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH)) in 2015 split into the academic department, focussing on the teaching of digital culture, and King's Digital Lab, which operates the research and development activities formerly carried out by the Department/Centre\u201d6 \n\nMost universities have DH Centres for the multi-disciplinary people like me. They draw upon interested students and offer a haven for projects like Michagain State\u2019s MATRIX center for digital humanities and social sciences. Even there, MATRIX focuses on cultural heritage and preservation \u2013 and builds software to do so, not least because of the influence of Ethan Watrall. \n\nThe term is fundamentally incoherent. It has no particular relevance to employers, and judging from how it is sold to students as either \u201cparticipate in a digital centre\u201d or \u201cdigital cultures.\u201d Many of the DH programs in Australia have been wound down over the last three years. Looking at the executive committee of the aaDH 7:  \n\nWestern Sydney: Masters discontinued in 2021 \n\nFlinders: No DH. GLAM connection \n\nMonash: Corpus Linguistics, Big Data. DH major discontinued 2020 \n\nMelb: DH unit discontinued 2021, GLAM focused \n\nANU:  \n\nStill offers a MA https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2024/program/mdhpu \n\nOffers a minor https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2024/minor/DIHU-MIN Mostly focused on digital culture and art due to the listed contact person. \n\nExtremely confusing \n\nOtago: Library support and a \u201chub\u201d \n\nMQ: Shawn Ross.  \n\nThere are no commonalities, except for a decline in programs and scholarship in Australia since the pandemic. There is an insufficient core community of scholars here to support \u201ctraining the next generation of academics.\u201d And \u201ceResearch\u201d has fallen upon hard times across the sector. \n\n \n\nStrengths:  \n\nBig Tent: Libraries, GIS, Digital Tools, Corpus Linguistics, \u201cBig Data,\u201d website publishing, digital automation, social media, digital cultures \u2013 all feature in some subset across all these centres and researchers. \n\nProvides an interdisciplinary space for deep collaboration between computing and the humanities, however construed. \n\nEnables new modes of research and more extensive research in Arts and Social Sciences. \n\nAn established label to mean \u201ccomputing bits\u201d within arts and social sciences.  \n\nWeaknesses: These are the internal factors that place the organization at a disadvantage relative to others. They could include areas where the organization is lacking or where improvements could be made. \n\nMQ has no infrastructure. According to a pre-covid eResearch survey, we have quite a distance to go before we achieve \u201caverage\u201d eResearch support comparable to other universities. This is also the case for DH. \n\nThe MQ FoA Strategic Plan asserts a \u201cdigital transformation\u201d with relation to students and \u201cand digitally enabled research in the strategic and everyday decision making of the Faculty of Arts.\u201d -- this has not happened effectively. We do not have a digitally enabled research strategy.  \n\nTo improve this lack, we need to ensure that from a Workload perspective, building digital skills is an accepted use of Service time, that digitally enabled projects get \u201cbonus points\u201d in terms of promotion committee evaluations, and that we have enough infrastructure to allow for this encouragement. \n\nDH, as a sector, is \u201cplayed out.\u201d There has been a declining emphasis across Australia on \u201cDH,\u201d with minors, masters programs, and units being in decline. Bell\u2019s work at ANU on cybernetics represents a pivot away from the Humanities. WSU has dropped their DH experiment, and Melbourne\u2019s eResearch centre is also in decline. There is little to no evidence of DH or \u201cdigital culture\u201d being relevant to students or employers. \n\nDigital skills are expected. Few folks know what that means beyond \u201ccompetence with excel\u201d or \u201cCan use Adobe products.\u201d There are significant missed opportunities here. \n\nWe have no ability to teach these advanced digital skills within a humanities context. We have not the people, nor the time, nor the resources to support an initiative like this. If we were to change our priority, it would have to be at the expense of other opportunities. \n\nOur students are exhausted and from recent interactions, terrified of technology. There is a great anxiety around using Generative AI with the general feeling that (from discussions with multiple convenors) that it is just \u201ctoo hard\u201d (unfortunately a direct quote from a student) to use effectively.  \n\nOur staff is exhausted and doesn\u2019t have a good sense of where to begin, even if they had the time and resources to start. There is no sense that going down this route is an effective use of their limited time. \n\nOur HDR students are keen but lack supervision in this regard. We do not encourage the use of tools like LaTeX for thesis writing (as supervisors demand documents in Word), nor do we encourage supervisors to push their students in this direction. Again, it\u2019s a resourcing and intention issue. \n\nOpportunities: These are external factors that the organization could exploit to its advantage. They could include market trends, changes in technology, policy changes, or shifts in consumer behaviour \n\nThere are opportunities with Generative AI to have this be the spearhead of our focus. As Breen notes: \u201cBut the thing is: LLMs are deeply, inherently textual. And they are reliant on text in a way that is directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in university humanities classes.\u201d8 -- We have an opportunity to lead the university and the nation if we focus strongly on this digital opportunity. We have six months to start this pivot. \n\nDH is not a useful label for Generative AI, but there are people spruiking DH 2.0: https://www.unlv.edu/news/unlvtoday/digital-humanities-20-generative-ai-oct-24 There is an opportunity to follow Breen to argue for this label as part of our research. It could form a \u201cCentre\u201d (following most DH models) rather than a degree. \n\nThere is massive demand for digitally literate students who can use prompts as part of their everyday work. \u201cPrompt Engineering\u201d utterly misses the point, but we can use this impluse to sneak in \u201ctelling stories about data\u201d as a secondary objective \u2013 either as part of assessments, a unit on AI, or a named \u201cDH\u201d opportunity. \n\n \n\nThreats: These are external factors that could harm the organization. They could include competition, economic downturns, regulatory changes, or negative public perception \n\nWe have no comms or guidance from the chancellery. While I helped write the guidance note for the use in Research \u2013 it's hard to tell what position they have on its use. (They do seem to be very excited to research about it, but it is harder to understand their position about its use.) \n\nNo one in FoA \u201cowns\u201d DH/Generative AI \u2013 and is empowered to make decisions and policy across all of its facets. \n\nFor Generative AI: \n\nThere may be copyright or IP implications. There are certainly terms of service \timplications. \n\nAny meaningful use will have significant infrastructure costs. \n\nAny meaningful use will have extremely significant training implications. As well as additional time implications for assessment redesign. \n\nFor DH: \n\nNo reliable academic community in Australia \u2013 makes it hard to recruit academics \n\nWe are at the wrong part of the cycle in terms of Australian support for this discipline \n\nPoorly operationalised and even more poorly understood \u2013 hard to sell as a desirable skill in this form. Few universities have demonstrated success with a DH degree (undergraduate or postgraduate.) \n\n \n\nAnalysis:  \n\n\u201cMoral reforms and deteriorations are moved by large forces, and they are mostly caused by reactions from the habits of a preceding period. Backwards and forwards swings the great pendulum, and its alternations are not determined by a few distinguished folk clinging to the end of it. \u2013 Sir Charles Petrie, THE VICTORIANS.\u201d (From Neal Stephenon, The Diamond Age) \n\nThe pendulum has swung away from Digital Humanities 1.0 as it was concieved in the last two decades. While there are established and uncontroversial uses for Geographic Information Systems, Digital Cultures, Web Development, Corpus Linguistics, and \u201cdoing humanities with technology\u201d -- the big tent approach supporting \u201cdigitally enabled scholarship\u201d9 has ebbed after COVID. Universities across Australia have deemphasised or pivoted their Digitally Enabled Research/Digital Humanities support into specialised centres or approaches. ANU has Cybernetics (control systems, organisations, and societies \u2013 not merely robots) with a DH major run by an Art Historian. Their degree offering requires students to take digital culture, a light dusting of technology, and then a random set of Arts, Design, Computing, and Media units. This major maps quite closely to the one from King\u2019s College London10. This \u201dDigital Culture\u201d major is also offered by USyd11 , Queensland12, Newcastle13, and University of the Sunshine Coast14. Reading between the lines, these seem to advertise: \u201dhow to be an online influencer.\u201d GLAM, the more entailed technologies, corpus linguistics, and GIS have no mention in this \u201csocial media influencer\u2019s degree.\u201d We do not need to offer one of these.  \n\nThere are researchers exploring corpus linguistics here, at USyd15, and across Australia \u2013 but no extraordinary undergraduate emphasis on the topic. To a first approximation, much of the oxygen in the room has been consumed by \u201dData Science\u201d -- emphasising statistics and computer science over communications and effective comprehension. Most universities have GIS units, but few are part of the Arts and Humanities faculties. Internationally, DH usually takes the form of a research centre, operationalised according to the parent disciplines of the founders of the centre. I.e. Michagan State\u2019s MATRIX center focuses on digital cultural preservation due to Watrall\u2019s influence. Giessen (JLU) hosts the Text Encoding Initiative due to Mukherjee.  \n\nThe label \u201cDigital Humanities\u201d is worthless to undergraduates and of little value as a department label. The pendulum is at the extreme of its arc \u2013 though Generative AI and Breen\u2019s \u201ctextual approach\u201d to understanding these systems16 suggests that the pendulum may swing back the other way. The grave danger of Generative AI, in terms of employability, is Borgmann\u2019s \u201dEfficiency for efficiency\u2019s sake.\u201d17 There are, suddenly, opportunities for \u201dGenerative AI\u201d degrees and units \u2013 those degrees should be in the Arts as the tools from arts: historiography, critical readings, and the very act of encoding expertise in a prompt are fundamentally textual and activities that history and philosophy may already contribute to. Digital techniques will be most useful and most opposed when they are embedded into assessment. They will be useful because many of our students will need to engage with digital tools \u2013 sources of data, analysis techniques, query techniques, prompt techniques (as of February) -- and will need to be able to examine them and tell stories. Not necessarily in the statistical sense, but the patterns of application and critical comprehension will be invariant for many jobs using the skills from our disciplines. \n\nHowever, these digital skills are antithetical to the self-narratives/mindset of many of our students and many of our faculty. Their narrative can be that they don\u2019t see themselves as technical, that they don\u2019t like or \u201cget\u201d programming.  \n\nWith the advent of Generative AI, these narratives of opposition may be subverted. While \u201cknowing something about something\u201d 18 is still necessary \u2013 knowledge of the technique\u2019s existence and mechanisms of application is the minimum, rather than knowledge of how to use excel properly, or even to (heavens forbid) program. Thus, if we are to embrace the opportunities of digital humanities this decade, much of that hope lies with Generative AI. Though I still maintain that our geography department should offer GIS units.  \n\nOur students must be able to ask questions of data and tell stories about the results, using the techniques and contexts of their disciplines. These questions should require transformation and analysis, not mere regurgitation. We must assume that effective Generative AI use is a prerequisite for graduation. We do not want to make \u201cDigital Cultures\u201d -- how to be an influencer \u2013 degrees. "

This will help gather the latest information to update your analysis with current developments in Digital Humanities.\n\n## Primary Research Directive\n\nConduct a thorough and exhaustive search of all academic, institutional, and high-quality sources on Digital Humanities (DH) as of 2025. Create an annotated bibliography organized by source type to support an update of a SWOT analysis. Do not create the SWOT itself, but provide comprehensive source material that would enable such an update.\n\n## Functional Decomposition of Research Areas\n\n### 1. Conceptual Evolution of Digital Humanities\n- How is \"Digital Humanities\" defined and operationalized across different institutions globally in 2025?\n- Identify significant shifts in how DH has been conceptualized since 2020-2023\n- Document how leading DH centers and departments frame their mission and scope\n- Analyze whether the field has become more coherent or remains fragmented in its definition\n\n### 2. Current Academic Landscape\n- Catalog and describe active DH centers, departments, and labs at major universities worldwide\n- Document undergraduate and graduate programs specifically focused on DH\n- Identify trends in program creation, continuation, or discontinuation since 2020\n- Compare curriculum structures and focus areas across different institutions\n\n### 3. Relationship with Generative AI\n- Research how DH has integrated or responded to generative AI technologies\n- Document any emergence of \"DH 2.0\" frameworks incorporating AI\n- Analyze how DH centers are researching, teaching, or utilizing generative AI\n- Identify scholarly work examining the intersection of DH methodologies and generative AI\n\n### 4. Infrastructure and Resource Models\n- Identify successful models for DH infrastructure support at universities\n- Document funding structures for sustainable DH initiatives\n- Research technical requirements and platforms commonly used in current DH practice\n- Compare resource allocation strategies across different institutional contexts\n\n### 5. Employment and Skills Relevance\n- Research current job market demand for DH-related skills\n- Identify which specific DH competencies are valued by employers\n- Document career outcomes for DH program graduates\n- Analyze how industry perceptions of DH qualifications have evolved\n\n### 6. Pedagogical Approaches\n- Document innovative teaching methods in DH education\n- Research assessment strategies that effectively incorporate digital tools\n- Identify successful approaches to teaching technical skills to humanities students\n- Compare student engagement and outcomes across different pedagogical models\n\n### 7. Regional Developments\n- Provide detailed analysis of the state of DH in Australia in 2025\n- Compare with developments in North America, Europe, and Asia\n- Identify regions experiencing growth vs. decline in DH initiatives\n- Document international collaborations and knowledge exchanges\n\n### 8. Future Trajectories\n- Identify emerging technologies or methodologies being incorporated into DH\n- Document scholarly predictions about the future evolution of the field\n- Research strategic planning documents from major DH centers\n- Analyze funding trends and priorities from major grant organizations\n\n## Source Requirements\n\n1. **Academic Publications**: \n   - Peer-reviewed journal articles from 2023-2025\n   - Conference proceedings from major DH conferences (DH2023-2025)\n   - Published books and edited collections on DH topics\n\n2. **Institutional Sources**:\n   - University websites, particularly DH centers and departments\n   - Strategic plans and mission statements\n   - Program descriptions and curriculum documentation\n   - Annual reports from DH initiatives\n\n3. **Professional Organizations**:\n   - Publications and reports from ADHO, aaDH, and similar organizations\n   - Job postings and career guidance materials\n   - Professional development resources\n\n4. **Industry Perspectives**:\n   - Reports on skills demand from relevant industries\n   - Case studies of DH applications in non-academic contexts\n   - Partnership initiatives between universities and external organizations\n\n5. **Government and Funding Bodies**:\n   - Policy documents related to digital research and education\n   - Grant priorities and funded project descriptions\n   - National strategies regarding digital skills and humanities research\n\n## Annotation Requirements\n\nFor each source, provide:\n1. Complete citation in Chicago style\n2. Brief summary of key findings or arguments (100-150 words)\n3. Explicit relevance to SWOT categories (which strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat does this inform?)\n4. Assessment of the source's reliability and potential limitations\n5. Cross-references to other sources that confirm, challenge, or extend its findings\n\n## Output Format\n\nOrganize the annotated bibliography by source type and then chronologically within each type. Include:\n1. Executive summary highlighting the most significant findings (500-750 words)\n2. Thematic clusters that emerged across multiple sources\n3. Identification of knowledge gaps where further research is needed\n4. Full annotated bibliography as described above\n5. Index of institutions and their current DH initiatives\n\nDoes this approach encompass everything you need for your research? I can adjust any section to better align with your specific goals for updating the SWOT analysis.",
