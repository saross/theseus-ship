The Sch\u00f6n framework might be challenged as not directly applicable to AI systems\n6. The \"always produces an answer\" critique might need nuancing as some systems do express uncertainty\n\nRegister Issues:\n- Some paragraphs are indeed shorter than optimal for academic writing\n- The section would benefit from more explicit signposting and transitions\n- Could strengthen the academic register with more precise terminology and clearer structure\n\nThe section appears to need:\n1. More explicit acknowledgment of potential counterarguments\n2. Tighter integration between the Sch\u00f6n framework and the paper's broader argument\n3. Clearer transitions between paragraphs\n4. More consistent paragraph length and structure\n5. Stronger signposting of how this section connects to the paper's overall argument\n\nBased on my Toulmin analysis of the introduction and Section 2.1, here are the key proleptic concerns and register issues that need addressing:\n\n### Proleptic Arguments to Address:\n\n1. **Definition contestation**: Critics might argue your definition of \"agency\" is too stringent or anthropomorphic, setting an impossible standard that dismisses meaningful capabilities.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of task decomposition**: Some might contend that sophisticated task decomposition with embedded decision trees actually constitutes a form of limited but real agency.\n\n3. **Human-AI complementarity**: Critics could argue human supervision isn't merely compensating for deficiencies but represents a legitimate collaborative model where judgment is distributed rather than lacking.\n\n4. **Continuum vs. binary**: The binary framing of judgment/no-judgment might be challenged in favor of a continuum model of emerging capabilities.\n\n5. **Applicability of Sch\u00f6n**: Some might question whether frameworks developed for human practitioners can be legitimately applied to evaluate AI systems.\n\n### Register and Structure Improvements:\n\n1. The paragraphs vary considerably in length, with some being too brief for thorough academic development.\n\n2. Transitions between concepts need strengthening to create a more cohesive argumentative flow.\n\n3. Some technical claims would benefit from more precise terminology and explicit warrants.\n\n4. The section would benefit from stronger signposting connecting to the paper's broader technoscholasticism argument.\n\nWould you like me to focus on developing a specific proleptic counter-argument first, or would you prefer I begin by addressing the structural and register issues throughout the section?",

The paragraphs vary considerably in length, with some being too brief for thorough academic development.\n\n2. Transitions between concepts need strengthening to create a more cohesive argumentative flow.\n\n3. Some technical claims would benefit from more precise terminology and explicit warrants.\n\n4. The section would benefit from stronger signposting connecting to the paper's broader technoscholasticism argument.\n\nWould you like me to focus on developing a specific proleptic counter-argument first, or would you prefer I begin by addressing the structural and register issues throughout the section?",

            "content": "\\subsection{Agency vs. Task Decomposition}\n\nClaims of \\textit{agentic} capabilities, like those used by OpenAI's marketing team to describe their Deep Research workflow \\parencite{openai_introducing_2025}, frequently centre upon criteria like adaptability and complexity-handling, as articulated by \\textcite{shavit_practices_2023}. Specifically, OpenAI defines agenticness as \"the degree to which a system can adaptably achieve complex goals in complex environments with limited direct supervision\" \\parencite[p. 5]{shavit_practices_2023}. This definition operationalises dimensions of agency primarily around adaptability, goal complexity, environmental complexity, and independent execution. While useful for benchmarking diverse AI systems and developing safety mechanisms, OpenAI's definition implicitly assumes that complexity-handling alone sufficiently captures genuine agency\u2014everything else being a matter of degree, rather than kind. This framing elides a crucial distinction: the ability to decompose tasks is necessary but fundamentally insufficient for agency, which requires the capacity to judge whether those tasks have been appropriately accomplished.\n\nA more precise conceptual hierarchy distinguishes between task decomposition (parsing complex instructions into constituent steps), goal-following (true agency that requires judgment about goal attainment), and goal-setting (AGI-like capacity to determine goals autonomously). Current systems like Deep Research demonstrably operate at the task decomposition level\u2014they take a context window, process what they believe their task to be, await minimal confirmation, and execute. As one of our observations notes, \"Deep Research...takes the entire context window, you push Deep Research, and then it crunches down what it thinks its task is, and then you say go, or you give it a bit of feedback and it goes.\" This execution pattern reveals systems that operate within predetermined methodologies rather than exhibiting genuine agency. While some might argue that sufficiently sophisticated task decomposition constitutes a rudimentary form of agency, this perspective conflates procedural complexity with judgment. The distinction is not merely academic; it fundamentally determines whether users can reasonably expect these systems to recognize and rectify their own failings or must instead incorporate extensive human oversight.\n\nSch\u00f6n's conceptualisation of reflective practice explicitly distinguishes genuine agency from mere task execution by emphasising the iterative, reflexive processes in expert problem-solving. Sch\u00f6n describes reflective practitioners as continually engaged in evaluating their actions and adjusting their approaches based on evolving understandings of their situation, asking:\n\\begin{quote}\nCan I solve the problem I have set? \\\\\nDo I like what I get when I solve this problem? \\\\\nHave I made the situation coherent? \\\\\nHave I kept inquiry moving?\n\\end{quote}\n\\parencite[p. 132]{schon_reflective_1994}. Reflection-in-action thus involves assessing intermediate outcomes, recognizing inadequacies in initial problem framings, and iteratively adjusting goals and strategies in response to observed realities. \n\nThis reflexive capacity fundamentally differs from current AI implementations. When OpenAI's model, during a Deep Research session, momentarily wonders \"if sticking to the default web\\_with\\_bing will be more effective,\"\\footnote{https://chatgpt.com/share/67d66742-6640-8004-b2c7-9c1ed360776c} this does not represent Sch\u00f6nian reflexivity but merely a programmatic selection between predetermined options. One might object that applying frameworks developed for human practitioners to AI systems constructs an impossible standard. However, our purpose is not to anthropomorphize these systems but to precisely identify what capabilities remain absent. Sch\u00f6n further elaborates on reflection-in-action as a process \"spiral[ling] through stages of appreciation, action, and reappreciation,\" continuously evaluating and reframing problems based on new insights \\parencite[p. 132]{schon_reflective_1994}. The critical deficiency in current \"agentic\" models is their inability to deviate from or abandon predefined pathways, reducing their claimed agency to sophisticated task-following.\n\nProperly understood, these systems function as tools rather than agents. Where agents exercise judgment themselves, tools require user judgment for effective application. This distinction proves critical in setting appropriate expectations: \"This is not agentic, it is not goal following. We cannot treat it as goal following. We must treat it as a tool. It's just a tool.\" While some might argue that this represents merely a difference in degree rather than kind\u2014akin to the distinction between simple and complex tools\u2014this misconstrues the fundamental nature of judgment. Like pornography in Justice Stewart's famous formulation, the threshold of judgment may resist precise definition while remaining recognizable in its absence. The deficiency manifests not in degrees of sophistication but in the categorical inability to assess whether the system has properly accomplished what was asked of it.\n\nThe distinction between goal-following and the broader goal-setting capabilities associated with artificial general intelligence remains beyond this critique's scope. It suffices to acknowledge that reflective self-assessment, although necessary for authentic goal-following, is alone insufficient for broader AGI-like capacities. These would demand the autonomous instantiation and sustained reflexive evaluation of \\textit{internally} generated goals in reaction to the environment, rather than the execution of externally set goals from users and systems. The necessity of human oversight\u2014such as OpenAI's human-in-the-loop protocols\u2014implicitly acknowledges the reflective gap inherent in these systems \\parencite[9]{shavit_practices_2023}. Such mechanisms serve as pragmatic safety measures precisely because current AI implementations lack internal evaluative judgment: they cannot adequately assess goal attainability, evaluate success in goal \\textit{attainment}, clarify ambiguities, or explicitly reject impossible or fundamentally erroneous tasks.",

The critical deficiency in current \"agentic\" models is their inability to deviate from or abandon their self-predefined pathways, reducing their claimed agency to sophisticated task-following. Even though they may, akin to a trained carpenter, choose between this tool or that tool (e.g. run a Bing search or write some python), this choice-between-tools should not be mistaken for the reframing-of-goal with concomitant pauses and check-ins that Sch\u00f6n's reflexivity demands. \n\nProperly understood, these systems function as tools rather than agents. Whereas agents must exercise judgment themselves, tools require user judgment for effective application. Tool-using systems are distinct from goal-following ones in degree and in kind, even those these capabilities may be understood on something of a spectrum. A goal-following system, reflexive in the Sch\u00f6nian sense --- a true amplification of the user's ability-to-make-choices imposed upon the world --- will be able to earn and justify trust by knowing when to ask for help \\textit{during} the performance of a task, or to report sub-standard performance, an agent must be able to \\textit{judge} where reality and the goals set to it diverge. The best tool-using hierarchies are able to set aside poor outputs from lower-order tools (we observed hints of this in HuggingFace's Open Deep Research infrastructure as well as OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research \"working around\" problems of accessing web-pages), but are not able to be self-reflexive when operating at their own level of cognition within a given context window. The deficiency of agency manifests not in degrees of sophistication but in the categorical inability to assess whether the system has properly accomplished what was asked of it.\n\nFurthermore, the distinction between goal-following and the broader goal-setting capabilities associated with artificial general intelligence remains beyond this critique's scope.

            "content": "## 2.2 Three Dimensions of AI Judgment Deficiency\n\n### Introduction Paragraph Plan\n- **Purpose**: Frame the three dimensions as a comprehensive taxonomy of judgment deficiency\n- **Key elements**:\n  - Brief transitional paragraph connecting agency discussion to specific judgment limitations\n  - Introduce the three dimensions as interconnected but distinct\n  - Signal how these dimensions collectively create technoscholasticism\n  - Establish academic context for this taxonomy (e.g., relation to AI epistemology)\n\n### 2.2.1 Epistemic Humility\n\n**Primary source material**: '20250217 - Judgement epistemic humility.m4a' transcript\n\n**Key conceptual components**:\n1. **Definition and scholarly context**: Define epistemic humility in cognitive/philosophical terms\n   - Scholarly framing: Fischer (2024), Kidd (2016), Alfano (2017) on intellectual humility\n   - Distinguish between genuine epistemic humility and language performance\n\n2. **Manifestations of deficiency**:\n   - Confabulation without recognition of uncertainty\n   - False precision in areas of genuine uncertainty\n   - Inability to identify knowledge gaps\n   - Inability to distinguish between varying confidence levels\n\n3. **Specific examples**:\n   - OpenAI's model responses to impossible questions\n   - Perplexity/Deep Research accepting first plausible source\n   - Non-corrective behavior even when contradictions arise\n\n4. **Structural/causal analysis**:\n   - Training data lacking thought patterns of epistemic uncertainty\n   - Next-token prediction inherently favoring confident language\n   - Connection to Frankfurt's concept of bullshit (2005) and Hicks (2024)\n\n5. **Consequences for research**:\n   - Inability to properly identify literature gaps\n   - Over-reliance on first-found sources\n   - Lack of awareness of disciplinary boundaries\n\n### 2.2.2 Inductive Reasoning\n\n**Primary source material**: Sections on induction from various transcripts, particularly induction as \"precursor to common sense\"\n\n**Key conceptual components**:\n1. **Definition and scholarly context**:\n   - Distinguish inductive reasoning from pattern recognition\n   - Contextualize within philosophy of science (abduction vs. induction)\n   - Connect to research innovation and insight generation\n\n2. **Manifestations of deficiency**:\n   - Recognition of patterns without insight into meaning\n   - Inability to identify \"that's funny\" moments in data\n   - Missing the \"impulse of inquiry\" for pattern deviation\n   - Failing to notice significant but non-obvious connections\n\n3. **Technical constraints**:\n   - Next-token prediction architecture limitations\n   - Inability to \"move the cursor around\" in its thinking\n   - Required consistency with predicted tokens enforcement\n   - Lack of internal noise/variation in hypothesis generation\n\n4. **Specific examples**:\n   - Failure to generate novel connections across domains\n   - Inability to identify meaningful patterns in literature that aren't explicitly stated\n\n5. **Consequences for research**:\n   - Cannot identify genuinely novel research directions\n   - Limited to combinatorial rather than truly creative insights\n   - Unable to perform the key function of noticing gaps in literature\n\n### 2.2.3 Correspondence with Reality\n\n**Primary source material**: Transcript sections on \"Aristotelian fallacy\" and Carnapian confirmation\n\n**Key conceptual components**:\n1. **Definition and scholarly context**:\n   - Define correspondence theory of truth vs. coherence theory\n   - Contrast with technological scholasticism/Aristotelianism\n   - Tuomi's data/information/knowledge pyramid inversion\n\n2. **Manifestations of deficiency**:\n   - \"Stamp collecting\" approach to confirmation\n   - Tendency to accumulate sources until a vibe-based criterion is met\n   - Privileging of textual authority over critical assessment\n   - No interaction with \"the Real\" beyond text\n\n3. **Specific examples**:\n   - Digital Humanities example (universities claiming DH programs that no longer exist)\n   - Lack of historiographical assessment of source credibility\n   - Refusing to acknowledge temporal limitations of sources\n\n4. **Technical analysis**:\n   - Carnapian confirmation processes in Deep Research\n   - Reversed causal arrows in assessment\n   - Map with no territory problem\n\n5. **Consequences for research**:\n   - Inability to discard outputs based on real-world criteria\n   - Uncritical acceptance of sources based on formatting rather than content\n   - Fundamental misconception of knowledge as information aggregation\n\n### Integration Strategy\n- Each subsection will follow a parallel structure: definition \u2192 manifestations \u2192 examples \u2192 analysis \u2192 consequences\n- Technical terminology will be consistent across sections\n- Citations will be balanced between AI literature and epistemology/philosophy of science\n- Examples will be drawn from our empirical testing rather than relying on transcript quotes\n- Each section will maintain conceptual links to technoscholasticism framework\n- The subsections will build upon each other to create a comprehensive critique",

            "content": "## 2.2 Three Dimensions of AI Judgment Deficiency\n\n### Introduction Paragraph Plan\n- Brief framing that connects the absence of judgment to specific epistemological deficiencies\n- Introduce the three dimensions as complementary manifestations of technoscholasticism\n- Signal how these dimensions collectively create the \"map with no territory\" problem\n- Establish the hierarchy of importance (epistemic humility > inductive reasoning > correspondence with reality)\n\n### 2.2.1 Epistemic Humility\n\n**Core argument**: LLMs fundamentally lack the capacity to recognize the boundaries of their knowledge or question their own outputs - a deficiency that manifests in both overt confidence and faux demonstrations of uncertainty.\n\n**Structure**:\n1. **Philosophical grounding**:\n   - Define epistemic humility drawing on Fischer (2024), Kidd (2016), Alfano (2017)\n   - Distinguish between genuine epistemic humility and its performance\n   - Connect to Frankfurt's concept of bullshit (2005) and Hicks (2024) - indifference to truth\n\n2. **Technical explanation**:\n   - Training data lacks thought patterns of epistemic caution\n   - Next-token prediction creates confidence by statistical necessity\n   - Fundamental inability to mark knowledge boundaries during inference\n   \n3. **Empirical observations**:\n   - Example from OpenAI's Deep Research \"I'm thinking about...\"\n   - Digital Humanities example with defunct programs\n   - Perplexity accepting first plausible source\n\n4. **Technoscholastic implications**:\n   - Aristotelian fallacy: privileging well-formed, common statements over verifiable truth\n   - \"Authority claims the truth, therefore authority's claims prove my position\"\n   - The statistical nature of training creates a popularity-based authority hierarchy\n\n5. **Consequences for research**:\n   - Limitations in literature gap identification\n   - Inability to express genuine uncertainty vs. performance of uncertainty\n   - Lack of corrective behavior in the face of contradictions\n\n### 2.2.2 Inductive Reasoning\n\n**Core argument**: LLMs lack the \"impulse of inquiry\" - that intuitive nudge to notice anomalies and question established patterns - which is essential for genuine research insight.\n\n**Structure**:\n1. **Philosophical grounding**:\n   - Distinguish inductive reasoning from pattern recognition\n   - The \"that's funny\" moment in scientific discovery\n   - The role of anomaly detection in research progress\n\n2. **Technical explanation**:\n   - Pattern completion vs. pattern disruption capabilities\n   - Inability to \"move the cursor around\" in its thinking\n   - Lack of internal noise/variation in hypothesis generation\n   - Next-token constraint enforcing coherency at the expense of insight\n\n3. **The impulse of inquiry**:\n   - Define as the intuitive nudge that \"something's wrong\" requiring reassessment\n   - Connection to noticing deviations from expected patterns\n   - Importance in research as precursor to common sense and innovation\n   - Evolutionary role in human thought vs. absence in LLMs\n\n4. **Empirical observations**:\n   - Examples of when LLMs followed predictable patterns despite contradictory evidence\n   - Contrast with emerging capabilities in newer models (with appropriate caveats)\n   - Evidence from OpenAI's Deep Research systematic failures\n\n5. **Consequences for research**:\n   - Limitation in identifying novel connections across disciplines\n   - Inability to identify truly innovative research directions\n   - Missing the \"spark\" that drives genuine discovery\n\n### 2.2.3 Correspondence with Reality\n\n**Core argument**: LLMs operate in a purely textual domain with no direct access to or verification against reality, creating a fundamentally Aristotelian approach to knowledge.\n\n**Structure**:\n1. **Philosophical grounding**:\n   - Correspondence theory vs. coherence theory of truth\n   - Map-territory distinction from \"maps of no territory\" paper\n   - Tuomi's inversion of the data/information/knowledge pyramid\n\n2. **Technical explanation**:\n   - \"Carnapian confirmation\" in Deep Research workflows\n   - Accumulation of sources until a vibe-based threshold is reached\n   - Reversed causal arrows in assessment of truth\n\n3. **The Aristotelian fallacy in LLMs**:\n   - Privileging of textual authority over empirical evidence\n   - No capacity to verify claims against non-textual reality\n   - Stamp-collecting approach to evidence accumulation\n\n4. **Empirical observations**:\n   - Digital Humanities example with universities claiming programs that no longer exist\n   - Lack of historiographical assessment of source credibility\n   - Inability to acknowledge temporal limitations of sources\n\n5. **Consequences for research**:\n   - Uncritical acceptance of textual claims regardless of empirical validity\n   - No mechanism to discard outputs based on real-world criteria\n   - Fundamental mismatch with scientific research paradigms\n\n### Integration Strategy\n- Each subsection will follow the parallel structure: philosophical grounding \u2192 technical explanation \u2192 key concept \u2192 empirical observations \u2192 consequences\n- Will emphasize how these three deficiencies interact and reinforce each other\n- Will highlight how the absence of these three dimensions collectively creates what we call \"technoscholasticism\"\n- Will integrate concrete examples from our AI testing throughout\n- Will maintain clear connections to the \"map with no territory\" metaphor",

            "content": "\\subsubsection{Epistemic Humility}\n\nEpistemic humility\u2014the capacity to recognize and acknowledge the boundaries of one's knowledge\u2014represents perhaps the most fundamental dimension of judgment that current LLMs lack. This deficit manifests not merely as overconfidence but as a structural inability to distinguish between varying levels of certainty in different knowledge domains. While philosophers from Socrates to contemporary epistemologists have recognized this virtue as essential to genuine inquiry \\parencite{kidd_inevitability_2016, alfano_development_2017, fischer_intellectual_2025}, it remains conspicuously absent from even the most advanced LLMs, regardless of their capacity to mimic its linguistic patterns.\n\nAt its core, epistemic humility encompasses the realistic self-awareness of knowledge limitations, specifically the ability to clearly recognize and explicitly communicate uncertainty when appropriate \\parencite{singhal_rethinking_2024}. For researchers, this capacity is foundational, enabling the ongoing critical evaluation of one's epistemic position: weighing background knowledge against the sometimes conflicting claims made by various sources under examination. Yet when OpenAI's Deep Research makes statements like \"Hm, that's interesting. I'm looking at...\" to imply evaluation, its subsequent actions reveal a fundamentally different process. Rather than genuinely reassessing its understanding, the model typically accepts the first plausible response aligned with its preexisting statistical patterns and moves on to other sources. This pattern of \"an authority I searched for argues for my claim, therefore my claim is correct\" epitomizes what we term technoscholasticism.\n\nThis failure of epistemic humility stems from three interrelated deficiencies. First, LLMs fundamentally lack the impulse for self-critique\u2014they do not spontaneously doubt their own outputs in the way that effective researchers must. As one of our observations notes, \"the impulse to edit, the impulse to self-critique does not...is not a pattern exhibited in their training data. And for obvious reasons, published work doesn't have that thought pattern in it because it is the consequence of that thought pattern.\" Second, even when explicitly instructed to evaluate their work, these models lack the capability to fundamentally revise their approach. Third, they exhibit what Frankfurt describes as indifference to truth\u2014the defining characteristic of \"bullshit\" \\parencite{frankfurt_bullshit_2005, hicks_chatgpt_2024}. \n\nWe observed this pattern consistently across different models and tasks. When OpenAI's Deep Research was tasked with compiling sources on \"Digital Humanities,\" it confidently referenced triumphant webpages showcasing university programs that had been shuttered years earlier. When confronted with contradictions, it offered post-hoc justifications such as: \"I'm thinking about a Chinese authors conference submission on generative AI in DH. It's an early draft, so it might not be peer-reviewed, but it offers a unique global perspective.\" This self-serving rationalization reveals not epistemic humility but its opposite: a determination to maintain narrative coherence even when accuracy is compromised.\n\nThis pattern illustrates what might be termed an \"Aristotelian fallacy\" within these systems\u2014a contemporary digital revival of medieval scholasticism's approach to knowledge. Just as medieval scholars privileged authoritative texts over empirical observation, LLMs privilege well-formed, statistically common statements over verifiable truth. An AI responds authoritatively to prompts irrespective of genuine knowledge availability. This persistent response-generation, even when confronted with fundamentally impossible or nonsensical requests, highlights an intrinsic epistemic shortcoming: an inability or unwillingness to explicitly articulate genuine uncertainty or reject flawed premises.\n\nLLMs are fundamentally indifferent to truth in the manner Frankfurt describes\u2014generating superficially plausible claims without authentic epistemic commitment. This \"soft bullshit,\" as characterized by \\textcite{hicks_chatgpt_2024}, emerges because \"[if] it is not an agent then it can neither hold any attitudes towards truth nor towards deceiving hearers about its (or, perhaps more properly, its users') agenda.\" Yet when operating in what OpenAI claims is an \"agentic\" capacity, these systems still fail to maintain consistent attitudes toward truth. So long as the format doesn't contradict their defaults and an authority claims something to be true, the authority's claims will \"prove\" the AI's initial position.\n\nIn contrast to this performance, genuine epistemic humility in research practice involves continuous questioning and critical evaluation: explicitly asking if problems as framed are solvable, coherent, and whether the inquiry remains productive. It requires a reflexive willingness to admit that one's framing of problems, and thus solutions, may be inadequate or fundamentally misguided. Current LLMs, lacking this reflective capability, inevitably reproduce a superficial performance of epistemic humility rather than engaging in authentic intellectual virtue. This absence significantly undercuts their effectiveness as genuine agents within scholarly inquiry and knowledge production.\n\nThe consequences for research are profound. Without epistemic humility, these systems cannot properly identify genuine gaps in literature, distinguish between varying degrees of scholarly confidence, or engage in the critical self-correction that drives scientific progress. Their outputs exhibit what appears to be certainty across all domains, regardless of the actual evidential basis, creating a flattened epistemological landscape that bears little resemblance to the varied terrain of human knowledge with its mountains of certainty and valleys of speculation. This fundamental limitation is not merely a technical challenge but an epistemological one that strikes at the heart of what constitutes genuine research capability.",

            "content": "\\subsubsection{Epistemic Humility}\n\nEpistemic humility, the capacity to recognize and acknowledge the boundaries of one's knowledge, represents perhaps the most fundamental dimension of judgment that current LLMs lack. This deficit manifests not merely as overconfidence but as a structural inability to distinguish between varying levels of certainty in different knowledge domains. While philosophers from Socrates to contemporary epistemologists have recognized this virtue as essential to genuine inquiry \\parencite{kidd_inevitability_2016, alfano_development_2017, fischer_intellectual_2025}, it remains conspicuously absent from even the most advanced LLMs, regardless of their capacity to mimic its linguistic patterns.\n\nAt its core, epistemic humility encompasses realistic self-awareness regarding knowledge limitations, specifically the ability to clearly recognize and explicitly communicate uncertainty when appropriate \\parencite{singhal_rethinking_2024}. For researchers, this capacity serves as the foundation for ongoing critical evaluation of one's epistemic position: weighing background knowledge against sometimes conflicting claims made by various sources under examination. When OpenAI's Deep Research makes statements like \"Hm, that's interesting. I'm looking at...\" to imply evaluation, its subsequent actions reveal a fundamentally different process. Rather than genuinely reassessing its understanding, the model typically accepts the first plausible response aligned with its preexisting statistical patterns and continues to other sources. This pattern of \"an authority I searched for argues for my claim, therefore my claim is correct\" epitomizes what we term technoscholasticism.\n\nThis failure of epistemic humility stems from three interrelated deficiencies. First, LLMs fundamentally lack the impulse for self-critique; they do not spontaneously doubt their own outputs in the way that effective researchers must. As one of our observations notes, \"the impulse to edit, the impulse to self-critique is not a pattern exhibited in their training data. Published work doesn't have that thought pattern in it because it is the consequence of that thought pattern.\" Second, even when explicitly instructed to evaluate their work, these models lack the capability to fundamentally revise their approach. Third, they exhibit what Frankfurt describes as indifference to truth\u2014the defining characteristic of \"bullshit\" \\parencite{frankfurt_bullshit_2005, hicks_chatgpt_2024}. \n\nWe observed this pattern consistently across different models and tasks. When OpenAI's Deep Research was tasked with compiling sources on \"Digital Humanities,\" it confidently referenced triumphant webpages showcasing university programs that had been shuttered years earlier. When confronted with contradictions, it offered post-hoc justifications such as: \"I'm thinking about a Chinese authors conference submission on generative AI in DH. It's an early draft, so it might not be peer-reviewed, but it offers a unique global perspective.\" This self-serving rationalization reveals not epistemic humility but its opposite: a determination to maintain narrative coherence even when accuracy is compromised.\n\nThis pattern illustrates what might be termed an \"Aristotelian fallacy\" within these systems: a contemporary digital revival of medieval scholasticism's approach to knowledge. Just as medieval scholars privileged authoritative texts over empirical observation, LLMs privilege well-formed, statistically common statements over verifiable truth. An AI responds authoritatively to prompts irrespective of genuine knowledge availability. This persistent response-generation, even when confronted with fundamentally impossible or nonsensical requests, highlights an intrinsic epistemic shortcoming: an inability to explicitly articulate genuine uncertainty or reject flawed premises.\n\nLLMs are fundamentally indifferent to truth in the manner Frankfurt describes, generating superficially plausible claims without authentic epistemic commitment. This \"soft bullshit,\" as characterized by \\textcite{hicks_chatgpt_2024}, emerges because \"if it is not an agent then it can neither hold any attitudes towards truth nor towards deceiving hearers about its agenda.\" Yet when operating in what OpenAI claims is an \"agentic\" capacity, these systems still fail to maintain consistent attitudes toward truth. So long as the format doesn't contradict their defaults and an authority claims something to be true, the authority's claims will \"prove\" the AI's initial position.\n\nIn contrast to this performance, genuine epistemic humility in research practice involves continuous questioning and critical evaluation: explicitly asking if problems as framed are solvable, coherent, and whether the inquiry remains productive. It requires a reflexive willingness to admit that one's framing of problems, and thus solutions, may be inadequate or fundamentally misguided. Current LLMs, lacking this reflective capability, inevitably reproduce a superficial performance of epistemic humility rather than engaging in authentic intellectual virtue. This absence significantly undercuts their effectiveness as genuine agents within scholarly inquiry and knowledge production.\n\nThe consequences for research are profound. Without epistemic humility, these systems cannot properly identify genuine gaps in literature, distinguish between varying degrees of scholarly confidence, or engage in the critical self-correction that drives scientific progress. Their outputs exhibit what appears to be certainty across all domains, regardless of the actual evidential basis, creating a flattened epistemological landscape that bears little resemblance to the varied terrain of human knowledge with its mountains of certainty and valleys of speculation. This fundamental limitation is not merely a technical challenge but an epistemological one that strikes at the heart of what constitutes genuine research capability.",

This deficit manifests not merely as overconfidence but as a structural inability to distinguish between varying levels of certainty in different knowledge domains. While philosophers from Socrates to contemporary epistemologists have regarded this virtue as essential to genuine inquiry \\parencite{kidd_inevitability_2016, alfano_development_2017, fischer_intellectual_2025}, it remains conspicuously absent from even the most advanced LLMs, regardless of their ability to mimic its linguistic patterns.\n\nAt its core, epistemic humility encompasses realistic self-awareness regarding knowledge limitations, specifically the ability to clearly recognise and explicitly communicate uncertainty when appropriate \\parencite{singhal_rethinking_2024}. For researchers, this capacity serves as the foundation for ongoing critical evaluation of one's epistemic position: weighing background knowledge against sometimes conflicting claims made by various sources under examination. When OpenAI's Deep Research makes statements like \"Hm, that's interesting. I'm looking at...\"\\footnote{https://chatgpt.com/share/67d66742-6640-8004-b2c7-9c1ed360776c} to imply evaluation, its subsequent actions reveal a fundamentally different process. Rather than genuinely reassessing its understanding, the model typically accepts the first plausible response aligned with its preexisting statistical patterns and continues to other sources. This pattern of \"an authority I searched for argues for my claim, therefore my claim is correct\" epitomises what we term technoscholasticism.\n\nThis failure of epistemic humility stems from three interrelated deficiencies. First, LLMs fundamentally lack the impulse for self-critique; they do not spontaneously doubt their own outputs in the way that effective researchers must. As one of our observations notes, \"the impulse to edit, the impulse to self-critique is not a pattern exhibited in their training data. Published work doesn't have that thought pattern in it because it is the \\textit{consequence} of that thought pattern\"(Observation notes, 17 Feb 2025). Second, even when explicitly instructed to evaluate their work, these models lack the capability to fundamentally revise their approach. Third, they exhibit what Frankfurt describes as, \"an indifference to truth\", the defining characteristic of \"bullshit\" \\parencite{frankfurt_bullshit_2005, hicks_chatgpt_2024}.\n\nWe observed this pattern consistently across different models and tasks. When OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research was tasked with compiling sources on \"Digital Humanities,\" it confidently referenced triumphant university webpages showcasing university programs that had been shuttered years earlier. When confronted with contradictions, it offered post-hoc justifications such as: \"I'm thinking about a Chinese authors conference submission on generative AI in DH. It's an early draft, so it might not be peer-reviewed, but it offers a unique global perspective.\"\\footnote{https://chatgpt.com/share/67d6a0c5-7648-8004-b620-70d91fdb7239\n%TODO Get thoughts\n} This self-serving rationalization reveals not epistemic humility but its opposite: a determination to maintain narrative coherence even when accuracy is compromised.\n\nThis pattern illustrates what might be termed an \"Aristotelian fallacy\" within these systems: a contemporary digital revival of medieval scholasticism's approach to knowledge. Just as medieval scholars privileged authoritative texts over empirical observation, LLMs privilege well-formed, statistically common statements over verifiable truth. An AI responds authoritatively to prompts irrespective of genuine knowledge availability. This persistent response-generation, even when confronted with fundamentally impossible or nonsensical requests, highlights an intrinsic epistemic shortcoming: an inability to explicitly articulate genuine uncertainty or reject flawed premises.\n\n%TODO CITE!!\n\nLLMs are fundamentally indifferent to truth in the manner Frankfurt describes, generating superficially plausible claims without authentic epistemic commitment. This \"soft bullshit,\" as characterized by \\textcite{hicks_chatgpt_2024}, emerges because \"if it is not an agent then it can neither hold any attitudes towards truth nor towards deceiving hearers about its agenda.\" Yet when operating in what OpenAI claims is an \"agentic\" capacity, these systems still fail to maintain consistent attitudes toward truth. So long as the format does not contradict their defaults and an authority claims something to be true, the authority's claims will \"prove\" the AI's initial position.\n\nIn contrast to this performance, genuine epistemic humility in research practice involves continuous questioning and critical evaluation: explicitly asking if problems as framed are solvable, coherent, and whether the inquiry remains productive. It requires a reflexive willingness to admit that one's framing of problems, and thus solutions, may be inadequate or fundamentally misguided. Current LLMs, lacking this reflective capability, inevitably reproduce a superficial performance of epistemic humility rather than demonstrating authentic intellectual virtue. This absence significantly undercuts their effectiveness as genuine agents within scholarly inquiry and knowledge production---again, they usually do not pause, consider, and consider their task failed by their own hand.\n\nThe unthinking use of these \\textit{tools} in AI-enabled research carries specific, if seldom considered, risks. Without effective judgement born of epistemic humility, these systems cannot properly identify genuine gaps in literature, distinguish between varying degrees of scholarly confidence, or engage in the critical self-correction that drives scientific progress. Their outputs exhibit what appears to be certainty across all domains, regardless of the actual evidential basis, creating a flattened epistemological landscape that bears little resemblance to the varied terrain of academic/scicentific knowledge. In a Lakatosian sense \\parencite*{imre_falsification_1970\n%TODO find page\n}, there is no self-reflexive espitimological regard for the \"hard core\" of a research programme versus its \"protective belt.\" Instead, all claims that are made with authority serve to accumulate evidence in the Carnapian confirmatory sense, so that the LLM may make an utterance backed by authority.\n% TODO Cite carnap\nThis fundamental limitation is not merely a technical challenge but an epistemological one that strikes at the heart of what constitutes genuine \\textit{unsupervised} and delegatable research capability. \n"

Research Implications**\n- Limitation on identifying novel connections across disciplines\n- The \"Dwarkesh question\" - why haven't these systems made novel discoveries despite vast training?\n- Connection to technoscholastic tendency to privilege existing patterns\n- Implications for AI-assisted research: need for human monitoring of pattern deviations\n\n**6. Connection to Map/Territory Framework**\n- Induction requires both map (theory) and territory (empirical reality)\n- LLMs have maps of no territory - statistical patterns without empirical grounding\n- Without territory contact, no meaningful induction is possible\n- The map/territory gap explains the absence of genuine \"that's funny\" moments\n\n**Key Citations to Include:**\n- Kuhn on scientific revolutions and anomalies\n- Peirce on abduction (potentially)\n- Frankfurt on bullshit (connecting to previous section)\n- Supporting examples from scientific discovery literature\n- Technical papers on next-token prediction constraints\n\n**Australian English Spelling to Maintain:**\n- Recognise\n- Generalise\n- Theorise\n- Characterise\n- Emphasise\n- Etc.\n\n**Formatting Notes:**\n- Use LaTeX paragraph breaks (double newline)\n- Keep comments with % for planning\n- Use \\textit{} for emphasis\n- Maintain academic tone with precise terminology\n- Include footnotes for specific model behaviors observed",

Let me analyze the key elements from these quotes:\n\n1. Surprise as breaking a habit of expectation (CP 6.469, 1908) - This aligns perfectly with your description of noticing something unexpected or \"that's funny\" moment.\n\n2. Research beginning from realizing an erroneous expectation - This captures the moment of noticing a discrepancy between what was expected and what was observed.\n\n3. Abduction as the starting point of research - This validates the centrality of this capability to genuine research.\n\n4. The \"flash\" of insight - This describes the experiential quality of the impulse of inquiry.\n\n5. \"Putting together what we had never before dreamed of putting together\" - This highlights the creative, non-deterministic nature of abduction that contrasts with the deterministic next-token prediction of LLMs.\n\nThese quotes provide a solid scholarly foundation for the \"impulse of inquiry\" concept. We can use this to anchor the 2.2.2 section in established philosophical discourse while maintaining your specific focus on the inability of LLMs to experience this crucial moment of surprise and insight due to their technical constraints.\n\nThe Peirce connection is particularly valuable as his work on abduction is widely respected in philosophy of science. It will help position your critique within existing epistemological frameworks.\n\nPerfect! Peirce's concept of abduction through Nubiola provides the exact scholarly foundation we need. These quotes beautifully capture what you've been describing as the \"impulse of inquiry\":\n\n1. The notion that \"surprise arises from the breaking of a habit\" aligns perfectly with your description of noticing something unexpected.\n\n2. \"Research begins when we realize that we had some erroneous expectation\" - This is precisely the moment when one pauses to reconsider assumptions.\n\n3. The characterization of abduction as a \"flash\" and \"an act of insight\" that involves \"putting together what we had never before dreamed of putting together\" captures the non-deterministic nature of this process.\n\nThis framing provides several advantages for our argument:\n\n1. It grounds your observation in established philosophical discourse (Peirce is a foundational figure)\n2. It emphasizes that abduction is the *starting point* of research, not just a component\n3. It highlights the creative, non-linear cognitive process that contrasts with LLMs' sequential token prediction\n\nWith this scholarly foundation, we can now draft 2.2.2 by contrasting the abductive \"flash of insight\" with the fundamental technical constraints of next-token prediction, inability to \"move the cursor around,\" and the structural inability to experience surprise at unexpected patterns.\n\nShall I proceed with drafting 2.2.2 using Peirce/Nubiola as our theoretical foundation?",

The notion that \"surprise arises from the breaking of a habit\" aligns perfectly with your description of noticing something unexpected.\n\n2. \"Research begins when we realize that we had some erroneous expectation\" - This is precisely the moment when one pauses to reconsider assumptions.\n\n3. The characterization of abduction as a \"flash\" and \"an act of insight\" that involves \"putting together what we had never before dreamed of putting together\" captures the non-deterministic nature of this process.\n\nThis framing provides several advantages for our argument:\n\n1. It grounds your observation in established philosophical discourse (Peirce is a foundational figure)\n2. It emphasizes that abduction is the *starting point* of research, not just a component\n3. It highlights the creative, non-linear cognitive process that contrasts with LLMs' sequential token prediction\n\nWith this scholarly foundation, we can now draft 2.2.2 by contrasting the abductive \"flash of insight\" with the fundamental technical constraints of next-token prediction, inability to \"move the cursor around,\" and the structural inability to experience surprise at unexpected patterns.\n\nShall I proceed with drafting 2.2.2 using Peirce/Nubiola as our theoretical foundation?",

This capability, which Charles Sanders Peirce more precisely termed abduction, represents the foundational cognitive process that initiates genuine research inquiry. As Nubiola explains, \"Surprise arises from the breaking of a habit, it 'breaks in upon some habit of expectation' (CP 6.469, 1908). Our activity of research begins when we realise that we had some erroneous expectation, which perhaps we ourselves were not even conscious of having\" \\parencite[124]{nubiola_abduction_2005}.\n\nThis \"surprise\" at unexpected patterns\u2014the recognition that something does not conform to existing frameworks\u2014serves as the precursor to scientific discovery. It is fundamentally different from pattern recognition, which merely identifies regularities that already fit within established categories. While LLMs excel at the latter, they systematically fail at the former due to architectural constraints that limit their ability to experience genuine surprise or notice erroneous expectations.\n\nThe technical architecture of these models, built around next-token prediction, creates a fundamental barrier to abductive reasoning. When generating text, an LLM cannot \"move the cursor around\" in its thinking or delete tokens once generated. It must maintain coherence with previously generated content, which inherently constrains its ability to recognise contradictions or unexpected patterns within its own outputs. This constraint is not merely a limitation of current implementations but a structural feature of the token-by-token generative paradigm itself.\n\nOur testing revealed that even when provided with data containing clear anomalies or contradictions, LLMs tend to incorporate these into a coherent narrative rather than pausing to identify the contradiction itself. When OpenAI's Deep Research encountered conflicting evidence about the chronology of software tools in archaeology, it simply presented both chronologies as potentially valid perspectives rather than recognising the factual inconsistency as a problem requiring resolution. Instead of experiencing surprise at the contradiction\u2014the breaking of an expectation that factual claims should be consistent\u2014it smoothed over the inconsistency through rhetorical means.\n\nPeirce characterises the moment of abductive insight as a distinctive cognitive event: \"The abductive suggestion comes to us like a flash. It is an act of insight, although of extremely fallible insight. It is true that the different elements of the hypothesis were in our minds before; but it is the idea of putting together what we had never before dreamed of putting together which flashes the new suggestion before our contemplation\" \\parencite[126]{nubiola_abduction_2005}. This \"flash\" of insight\u2014the creative recombination of existing knowledge into novel hypotheses\u2014requires precisely the kind of non-linear cognitive movement that next-token prediction architecturally precludes.\n\nMore fundamentally, abduction requires the capacity to notice what is not present\u2014gaps, anomalies, or unexpected absences in a pattern. As Peirce notes, \"The starting point of research is always abduction. It generates the hypothesis that suggests what experiments must be performed, in which directions it is necessary to look\" \\parencite[123]{nubiola_abduction_2005}. LLMs, however, are structurally limited to processing what is explicitly present in their context window. They cannot recognise what should be there but isn't, except in the most mechanistic pattern-completion scenarios that have been extensively represented in their training data.\n\nThis limitation connects directly to our concept of technoscholasticism. Just as medieval scholastics prioritised reconciling authoritative texts over investigating empirical anomalies, LLMs reconcile conflicting information through rhetorical means rather than recognising contradictions as signals requiring investigation. The scholastic impulse to harmonise disparate authorities finds its contemporary expression in the LLM's statistical tendency to smooth over contradictions in favour of narrative coherence.\n\nThis architectural constraint helps explain the phenomenon identified in Dwarkesh's question\u2014why, despite having \"basically the entire corpus of human knowledge memorised,\" these systems haven't \"been able to make a single new connection that has led to a discovery\" \\parencite{tabarrok_dwarkeshs_2025}. Without the capacity for genuine surprise or the ability to notice erroneous expectations, LLMs cannot initiate the abductive processes that Peirce identified as the necessary starting point for research. They can simulate the products of research, such as literature reviews or syntheses of existing knowledge, but cannot perform the cognitive act that initiates new research directions.\n\nThe implications for researchers are significant. When using these tools, the responsibility for abductive insight\u2014for noticing unexpected patterns, contradictions, or gaps\u2014remains entirely with the human user. The LLM may assist in aggregating information or even in certain deductive reasoning tasks, but it cannot identify which patterns merit investigation or which contradictions signal potential discoveries. This limitation necessitates a research workflow that deliberately integrates human abductive reasoning at regular intervals, rather than delegating extended sequences of research activity to the LLM itself.",

(Again, let's not use en-dashes where we can). \n\nOk, here are the edits I've made. Does it work?\n\nThe second critical dimension of judgment absent in LLMs concerns inductive reasoning. Specifically, they lack the impulse to recognise patterns that deviate from expectations and generate novel hypotheses in response\\footnote{Current models in early 2025 certainly have the capacity to perform inductive and abductive experiments, if prompted correctly. One of Ballsun-Stanton's evaluations of new models involves the game Zendo, by Kory Heath. Models have consistently improved in their ability to induce the covering rule. However, they only apply this capcity when prompted to, rather than as a reflexive act upon their own output.}. This capability, which Charles Sanders Peirce more precisely termed abduction, represents the foundational cognitive process that initiates genuine research inquiry. As Nubiola explains, \"Surprise arises from the breaking of a habit, it 'breaks in upon some habit of expectation' (CP 6.469, 1908). \nOur activity of research begins when we realise that we had some erroneous expectation, which perhaps we ourselves were not even conscious of having\" \\parencite[124]{nubiola_abduction_2005}.\nThis \"surprise\" at unexpected patterns, the recognition that something does not conform to existing frameworks, serves as a necessary precursor to scientific discovery. It is fundamentally different from pattern recognition, which merely identifies regularities that already fit within established categories.
