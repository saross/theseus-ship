          "extracted_content": "\nUm,\n\nSo the structure of the paper is you have our discussion of why these things are not presented. We have our discussion of human being utility and our experience. These\n\nAnd our experiences are using it for research. And then we have the discussion of what, what do we need? The tool that genuinely does.\n\nHow? Facilitate. What these things are good are how do we interact with these things knowing that there are deficiently And so, the first thing that we need is, A cursor to do this. Right. The, the first thing that we need is.\n\nEach step in the to-do list. So, We can get the user's judgement as. Correctness. Because the thing is, is that for research And this is not. This is not the oh I'm not able to access that we saw in 7th February like This is going to be, oh, this lineup.\n\nOpener is. This output is back. This is not a quick. I should remove this. Because fundamentally, Fundamentally, what we see is that\n\nThey don't consider jud. Put more to the point. They don't have the inductive capacity of the intuition, whatever to know when they should. And therefore, Until we figure out some new technological advance that is we need to Anchor. Um, that\n\nSo, We need to be able to New a brown art todo list, right? It is, it is insufficient Is the current quote, agentic only great things do just take a step, right? Like the idea of a wonderful model of research is laughable. Yes. Uh, we should have that a note towards um the problems of sdlcs and why that's such a problem for us.\n\nUm,\n\nThis to-do list should should first off. Allow us to see what's in the context window. And to see what we're working on, but the the fundamental thing that these large language models don't have is the ability to forget to judge. That a certain line of thinking is bad, then to remove it because We know.\n\nBy virtue of how they work. These large language models. Will anchor. Long text. In their context window. Which means that\n\nAs they anchor on this text, if it's the wrong text. Not only. Not only is it excluding? Um, Content that we want but it's biasing the output in ways. That's not appropriate. And so, therefore, When we build literature for our deep research, We effectively need.\n\nAn indication of What sources? It has considered. What it's using and more to the point, what it's disusing. Um, and so So effectively. Considering that we're playing the game of of, um, Limiting context windows and it's it's hilarious. That 200 000 tokens is limited but what we're talking about.\n\nI've I've easily blown the context window out with trying to drop in nine papers. So Two hundred thousand tokens. Is not sufficient to do researching. Therefore we need a way of managing. Our tokens. And, What this means and we also need introspection. We need to be able to validate this.\n\nWe need ha transparency, not newly in the encoded thoughts. But okay at this step we have a This paper. We are pulling these quotes from it. Here is our summary of and understanding here is where in our document we should be using this paper when we get to this part of our document load the entire paper into the context window for this paragraph.\n\nRight. And so this is why outlines are so useful? Is because they allow us to go up when we get to that part of the outline when we get to that part of the mechanism. Whatever, that's not the right word, but whatever. Go change your context window, your working context window.\n\nTo go. Spin off a line of thought or whatever to apply. That paper to this paragraph, within the context of the section and and the document And so, We need. But, We also need human judgement, right? The first draught is always shit. The first lines of research are seldom the most correct lines, and so therefore, These systems have to leverage human judgement.\n\nAnd and not in the double confirm that deep research does right now, right? Because deep research right now. Takes this takes the entire context window. You push deep research. And then it it crunches down what it thinks its task is. And then you say go or you give it a bit of feedback when it goes.\n\nThat's not what I'm talking about, right? This is not agentic. It is not goal following We cannot treat it as gold following. We must treat it as a tool. It's just a tool. It is a tool that can be useful. It's a tool that can be thoughtful. It's just a tool.\n\nDon't remember if I talked about deleting. But we also need tombstones, we need to have indications of thoughts that we've had that are bad. And we have to be able to remove them durably. From the context window but we need to have proof that we've had this thought and chosen not to have it.\n\nUm, Which is. Ironic. But whatever.\n\nOkay. What time is it?\n\nWe have to outline. We have forgetting.\n\nWe have userjulent.\n\nAnd then we have\n\nAnd then we have different. Stages of interaction, where finding literature. Extracting, the literature and building the outline building, the first draught revising, the draught editing, and then outputting Should all be documented. And so this is why we We can't necessarily follow a waterfall sdlc. When we're producing 10 000 word, research reports.\n\nWe have to consider. Instead. That we have to treat each step in its own step that we need to have different mechanisms for Keep contracted this information. We need to choose which of these parts we're pulling from. And at every stage we have to rely on human judgement. Knowing that the AI's judgements is deficient but more to the point, not only is it deficient, it doesn't know that it's deficiency, doesn't know when to play the judgement.\n\nCool.\n"

The structure you described (discussion of non-agency, human utility, and needed improvements)\n2. The fundamental limitations of current AI systems (inability to forget, lack of induction)\n3. Your proposed solutions (to-do lists, context window visibility, source tracking)\n4. The different stages of the research process that need specialized handling\n\nThe section on \"Designing Better Research Tools\" (Section 6) specifically incorporates your ideas about structured to-do lists, context window management, and the integration of human judgment at critical points. I've also included your point about \"tombstones\" for rejected thoughts and the need for different mechanisms for different stages of the research process.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any particular section or make other adjustments to the outline?",
