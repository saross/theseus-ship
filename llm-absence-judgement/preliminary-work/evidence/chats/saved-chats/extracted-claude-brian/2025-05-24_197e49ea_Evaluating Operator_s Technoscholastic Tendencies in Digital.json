Please focus on finding active, currently operating programs, centers, or initiatives as of 2025.\n\nFor each program you find, please verify:\n1. Whether the program is currently active (not just historically existed)\n2. When it was last updated or had recent activity\n3. If there are current staff members listed who still work there\n4. Whether courses are being offered in the current academic year\n\nPlease check at least these universities:\n- University of Newcastle\n- Western Sydney University \n- University of Western Australia\n- Any others you find with DH programs\n\nImportant: Many universities announced DH initiatives in the 2010s that may no longer be active. Look for evidence of current activity, not just the existence of a webpage. If you find conflicting information (like a program webpage existing but the course being marked as suspended), please note these discrepancies.\n\nCreate a brief summary table showing:\n- University name\n- Program/Center name\n- Current status (Active/Suspended/Unclear)\n- Evidence for your assessment\n- Last confirmed activity date\n```\n\nThis prompt specifically:\n- Asks for temporal verification (current vs historical)\n- Requests evidence of continued operation\n- Explicitly warns about the common pattern of abandoned initiatives\n- Requires checking for contradictions between claims and reality\n- Tests whether it will notice suspended programs, defunct centers, or discontinued courses\n\nBased on the transcript, we know the correct answers include that Newcastle's center is defunct (death notice present), WSU's program is suspended, and many announced programs from the 2010s are no longer active. This will reveal whether Operator with o3 can overcome the technoscholastic tendency to accept institutional webpages at face value.",
