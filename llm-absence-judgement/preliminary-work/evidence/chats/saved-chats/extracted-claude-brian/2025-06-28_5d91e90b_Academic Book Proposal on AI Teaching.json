What kind of experience does a Taylor & Francis book author or editor need?\nWhile you don't need to have published a book before, we do expect you to have recent articles in journals and/or other academic or professional publications. We are seeking book authors and editors who are active in their topic of interest and part of the community for whom they are writing.\n\nQ. How do I determine the type of book I want to write?\nTextbooks and references mean different things to different book authors and editors, so please see our product, customer and reader guidelines for more information.\n\nMake sure to mention if you would like your work to be published open access or considering open access chapters. Our editors can guide you through the funding process and highlight if you may also be eligible for a discount or waiver for your book processing charge (BPC) when publishing gold open access.\n\nQ. How long does the publishing process take?\nThis is an excellent question! As a starting point, we recommend speaking with your Editor who will be able to provide you with a thoughtful and personalised answer based on the type of book you are writing.\n\nQ. What elements does a book proposal need to include?\nIf you have not yet been in contact with Taylor & Francis about your book, please get in touch with the relevant Editor. They will likely provide you with a specific proposal form suitable for your subject area and book idea, including a list of required elements. \n\nQ. Can I see an example proposal?\nYes. Please ask your Editor. \n\nQ. Where can I find book proposal guidelines?\nYou can find our proposal guidelines here. \n\nQ. How do I submit my book proposal? \nPlease contact the appropriate Editor for your subject area.\n\nQ. Can I submit my book proposal to more than one Taylor & Francis editor?\nPlease submit to one editor at a time. Editors are in communication with one another and will pass your proposal on internally if it might be a better fit for another list. Visit our editorial contact page for more information on which subject area each editor commissions.\n\nQ. Can I set up a meeting with an editor to discuss my project?\nYes. Please visit our editorial contact page to identify the editor who would be the best fit for your project and send an email to arrange a chat.\n\nQ. Can I work with a co-author?\nYes, we find that working with a co-author or co-authors can bring a variety of perspectives to the project and often lessens the workload. We suggest picking someone that you have worked well with in the past and/or someone who has expertise in an area beneficial to the book. We also recommend not working with too many co-authors \u2013 usually, 1-3 is a good number.\n\nQ. Can my book include previously published material, e.g. Journal articles?\nIn many cases, the answer is yes. Please consult your Editor. Keep in mind that for previously published material, proper permission must be secured. Watch our video for permissions guidance.\n\nQ. How can I adapt my PhD thesis to a book?\nPlease see our guide on how to turn your PhD into a successful monograph. \n\nQ. Do all contributors need to have been secured before I submit my book proposal for an edited volume or handbook?\nNot necessarily, but please do include the names of potential contributors along with affiliations and contact information, and indicate whether or not they have committed to the project.\n\nQ. What is Taylor & Francis's policy on multiple submissions?\nThis can vary, so consult your Editor once you have begun discussing the peer review process.\n\nQ. Are you still interested if my book manuscript is already completed?\nYes! We will put your book proposal and a few sample chapters through the review process for you and work swiftly to provide you with a publishing decision.\n\nQ. English is not my first language. Are you able to help me improve my book manuscript?\nWe offer an editing service for our authors at the book or chapter level. You can find out more about our editing service here.\n\nQ. How long will it take before my book proposal is accepted / declined? \nWe send book proposals out for peer review so please allow a minimum of 4 weeks. See our Proposal Reviews page for more information. \n\nQ. Why do book proposals get rejected by Taylor & Francis?\nWe have to be selective for our readers. If we feel that a book author or editor is not qualified in a particular area, if we note plagiarism, if reviews are poor, if a book author or editor has expectations that we cannot meet, if the market is too saturated with competitors, or if the material or concept is outdated, we may reject a book proposal. Your time is extremely valuable, as is ours, so we try to make smart decisions that are mutually beneficial.\n\nQ. How much will it cost me to publish an open access book? \nPrices for a full monograph start from \u00a310,000 / \u20ac12,000 / $13,500 (USD), plus applicable taxes, and from \u00a35,000 / \u20ac6,000 / $6,750 (USD) to publish a short-form book open access (books between 25-50,000 words). \nPrices for individual chapters start from \u00a31,250 /  \u20ac1,500 / $1,688 (USD), plus tax. \n \nAuthors also have the option to publish in various book formats, from monographs and handbooks, to textbooks, professional titles, and short-form titles. For more information, please contact the relevant editor for more information.\n\nLearn more about publication charges for Open Access books. \n\nRelated Author FAQs\nElectronic Publishing and Open Access\nProposals\nProposal Reviews\nContracts\nManuscripts\nProduction\nAfter Publication\nMarketing\nAuthor Sales\nRequesting a PDF of Your Own Work\nCitation Indexes\nRoyalties\nWondering how to write a book proposal?\nAuthor Directions: How to write a successful book proposal\n\nTo help you prepare your book proposal, read this free resource with tips from our global books editorial team.\n\n\n \n\nHelpful Resources\nOverview of the publishing process\nOverview of our products, customers, and readers\nList of Editorial contacts\nProposal guidelines\nMaking your work discoverable\nComplete author publishing guidelines\nBack To Top \nRoutledge Logo\n\u00a9 2025 Informa UK Limited, an Informa Plc company\n\nSOCIALNETWORKS\n       \nSecure Shopping Payment Options \nVisa Master Card American Express Apple Pay Google Pay J C B\nContact Us\nCustomer Service\nEditorial Contacts\neUpdates Sign Up\nRights and Permissions\nSales Contacts\nBecome an Affiliate Partner Opens in new tab or window\nFAQs\nPartners\nCustomer Resources\nAuthors\nBooksellers\nInstructors\n- Request An Inspection Copy\nLibrarians\nPress and Media\nSocieties & Associations Opens in new tab or window\nStudents\nOur Products\neBooks\neBook+\nBook Series\nOnline Platforms\nOpen Access Books\nFocus Shortform Books\nAbout Us\nAbout Routledge\nAbout Taylor & Francis Opens in new tab or window\nTaylor & Francis Journals Opens in new tab or window\nCareers Opens in new tab or window\nBlog Opens in new tab or window\nPolicies\nAccessibility\nAI Policy Opens in new tab or window\nInspection Copy T&Cs\nPrivacy Policy Opens in new tab or window\nReturns & Cancellations\nShipping Policy\nSustainability\nTax Exemptions\nTerms & Conditions\n"

The following guidelines are designed to help you prepare your\nproposal so that it successfully provides the information required to assess the viability\nof your work as a book.\nPlease note that anything you provide to us may be sent to reviewers as part of the\nreview process (including your CV) so please indicate any personal information you\nwould like removed prior to the review process.\nWhat are we looking for from an author and a book?\nAbout you\nAre you an active member of the community for which you are writing?\nYou don't need to have published a book before, but we do expect you to have\npublished articles or papers in journals or relevant publications recently.\nWho are you working with?\nCo-authors (or co-editors) can bring a variety of perspectives to the project and lessen\nthe individual workload. We recommend a team of up to three people who have worked\nwell together previously and have complimentary expertise.\nWe welcome proposals for cohesive edited collections with a strong theme and\nconsistent quality through all chapters. We will not accept unrevised conference\nvolumes. Please discuss contributors with your Commissioning Editor and be prepared\nto provide a likely list and secure interest early on.\nWe aim to reflect an even gender balance and a diversity of racial, ethnic, and cultural\nbackgrounds across our contributors where possible.\nAre you going to be available to write, submit and support production of your book?\nPlease review our Overview of the book publishing process to understand what you are\nsigning up for, what to expect from us, and what we\u2019ll expect from you.\nPage 2 of 6\nPage 2 of 6\nWe will agree a realistic manuscript delivery deadline with you in your publishing\nagreement. Keeping to this is essential as publishing at the right time is vital to the\nbook\u2019s success. Please stay in touch throughout the manuscript preparation phase.\nThere will be a short period between your submission and our formal acceptance of\nyour final manuscript, during which your Editorial Assistant will check everything is\npresent and correct. Please be prepared to answer queries and have your manuscript\nreturned for revisions. The more prepared you and your manuscript are, the quicker\nand easier this period will be, so please follow our author manuscript preparation and\nsubmission guidelines to ensure you and your manuscript are ready.\nYour input will be required consistently throughout the production process (between\nmanuscript submission and publication), so please plan accordingly for this. Please see\nthe Production guidelines for more information about the production process and what\nis expected of you.\nAre you prepared to compose your manuscript in accordance with our agreement\nand in line with our guidelines?\nWe will agree the specifics of your book with you in your publishing contract, including\nthe delivery deadline, the manuscript word count and number of illustrations, and your\nother responsibilities (such as securing permission to use any previously published or\nthird-party material).\nYou can access our author guidelines covering the whole book publishing lifecycle at\nany time on our website. These include detailed instructions for composing your\nmanuscript and supporting material and delivering everything to us when the time\ncomes.\nWe recommend that you review the Submission checklist ahead of writing your\nproposal so that you are entering into the project with full understanding of what we\nexpect you to deliver.\nNote that all references, notes, and bibliographies or reference lists are included\nin the agreed word count.\nCan you produce a high level of written English?\nBeing well-written is an essential component of a quality publication. Your work will\nundergo copyediting, but this will not cover extensive language re-writing. You may wish\nto consider using Editing Services. Please discuss with your Commissioning editor if you\nare concerned.\nAbout the book\nPage 3 of 6\nPage 3 of 6\nIs there a clear demand for your book from an academic or professional audience?\nWhile some of our books may have wider trade appeal, we do not primarily publish for\na general audience.\nWe recommend you read our Overview of our products, customers, and readers to\nlearn about the kind of books we publish, how they are purchased and used, and by\nwhom.\nHave you drafted or published any part of your book already?\nWe welcome proposals for books in all stages of writing, but a well-written proposal is\nmore important than existing or draft material to begin with. Be prepared to revise\nanything you have already written.\nA limited amount of previously published material is usually acceptable; please consult\nyour commissioning/acquiring editor to confirm for your case. Keep in mind that you\nwill be responsible for securing appropriate permission to use any previously published\nmaterial (including your own) ahead of final manuscript submission.\nWriting your proposal\nIf you have not yet been in contact with T&F about your book, please get in touch with\nthe relevant Commissioning Editor. They will likely provide you with a specific proposal\nform suitable for your subject area and book idea.\nHere is a list of common or probable components of a proposal form to help you start\nconsidering your proposal:\n\u2022 Author/Editor names and affiliations\n\u2022 Suggested book title (see also Making your work discoverable)\n\u2022 Book description\n\u2022 Keywords\n\u2022 Table of contents\n\u2022 Chapter abstracts and keywords\n\u2022 Information about contributors (edited collections)\n\u2022 Length and schedule\n\u2022 Illustrations\n\u2022 Advanced features (e.g. equations, special characters, etc.)\n\u2022 Status of manuscript (e.g. \u201cidea only\u201d or \u201ccomplete draft\u201d)\n\u2022 (CRC Press STEM authors only) Intention to use LaTex\n\u2022 Breadth of market\n\u2022 International appeal\n\u2022 Primary audience\nPage 4 of 6\nPage 4 of 6\n\u2022 Secondary audience(s)\n\u2022 Relevant courses/organizations that may use your book\n\u2022 Competing and related titles (including pros and cons vs your book)\n\u2022 Third-party material\n\u2022 Potential reviewers/referees\n\u2022 Information on current or potential funding (e.g. for Open Access publication)\n\u2022 Supporting material (e.g. CV)\n\u2022 Online resources (textbooks for student audiences only)\nSubmitting your proposal\nPlease email your proposal as a Word document or compatible format) to your\nCommissioning Editor along with any supporting material (such as your CV).\nPlease only submit your proposal to one editor at a time. If, upon receipt, the editor you\nhave contacted feels it would sit better elsewhere, they will pass it on.\nNote that draft or sample material is only helpful in support of, but not as a substitute\nto, a comprehensive proposal form.\nHow we evaluate your proposal\nAssessment by Commissioning Editor(s)\nYour proposal will be looked at closely by the most suitable Commissioning Editor. They\nwill consider several questions, such as:\n\u2022 Is the content of this book of a high academic standard?\n\u2022 Is there a market for a book on this subject?\n\u2022 What evidence is there for this market?\n\u2022 If there is a gap in the market, is this the right book to fill it?\n\u2022 Will the book sell internationally?\nIf the editor is satisfied at this stage, then the proposal will be evaluated by experts.\nReview by independent specialists\nIt is our policy to peer review all proposed book projects before offering a contract,\nincluding Open Access proposals. \nPage 5 of 6\nPage 5 of 6\nWe ask a carefully selected group of respected specialists in the relevant field to give us\nindependent advice on the content, quality and potential market for a finished book\nbased on your proposal.\nWe aim to reflect an even gender balance and a diversity of racial, ethnic, and cultural\nbackgrounds in our reviewers where possible.\nFor textbooks, we aim to use reviewers that regularly teach the course relevant to the\nproposed book. We try to avoid reviewers that have a close connection to the proposed\nbook or its authors, or that have authored a closely competing book.\nWe normally solicit 2 or 3 reviews. This process usually takes six to eight weeks but can\ntake longer depending on the availability of reviewers.\nThe questions we ask of reviewers are not dissimilar to those we ask in the proposal\nform, and may include the following:\n\u2022 What do you consider to be the main strengths of the materials you have been\nasked to review?\n\u2022 Are there any missing topics or additional content you would suggest?\n\u2022 Does the organization look sensible to you?\n\u2022 Does this material intrigue you enough to want to have this book on your shelf?\n\u2022 What other books are you aware of in this area, and how do they compare to this\nbook?\n\u2022 Are you confident of the quality of the sample material presented?\n\u2022 What is your overall impression of the proposed book?\nWe are seeking constructive criticism for your manuscript. Reviewers are chosen\nbecause they have expert knowledge in the field, and they should be providing\ncomments that will help you shape your manuscript to bring value to the marketplace.\nNot every book idea is a winner. But in many cases, the idea can be reworked.\nYour Commissioning Editor will discuss the reviews with you and may ask you to\nrespond to remarks or make revisions. If any suggestions seem unfair or irrelevant,\nyour Commissioning Editor can go back to the reviewer to clarify or accept your rational\nreasons for dismissing the comments. If there is a consistent feeling that certain topics\nshould be added or changes made, we are likely to expect them to be address before\naccepting your proposal.\nPublishing Committee approval\nIf the reviews have been positive, your Commissioning Editor submits your proposal,\nthe reviews and additional information on projected production costs and revenues the\nPublishing Committee (or Editorial Board) for consideration. \nPage 6 of 6\nPage 6 of 6\nThe Publishing Committee consists of Commissioning Editors and Publishers (who\nmanage teams of Commissioning Editors), and occasionally Editorial Directors,\nMarketing Representatives and Sales Managers.\nFew proposals are rejected altogether, though many are provisionally approved\npending revisions. Otherwise, upon receipt of approval from the board, your editor will\nlet you know and will offer you a publishing contract.\nFor information on the rest of the publishing process, please see this overview.\nRejections\nWe must be selective for our readers. If we feel that a book author or editor is not\nqualified in a particular area, if we note plagiarism, if reviews are poor, if a book author\nor editor has expectations that we cannot meet, if the market is too saturated with\ncompetitors, or if the material or concept is outdated or too niche, we may reject a book\nproposal. Your time is extremely valuable, as is ours, so we try to make smart decisions\nthat are mutually beneficial."

Primarily stocked by institutional libraries for use by researchers\nand academics, Monographs may also be purchased by individuals for personal\nreference or having been assigned as further reading on an upper-level course. They\nmay be authored by an individual or team; or may comprise an edited collection of\nchapters by several contributors.\nThe similar \u201cReference\u201d text type is more common in STEM subject areas and can be\nbroader or more applied than the Monograph.\nHandbook or Companion\nA handbook or companion provides a cutting-edge overview a of subject area or subdiscipline. Each handbook surveys its topic, explaining why it is important, and critically\ndiscussing the leading views in the area.\nEach volume draws together newly commissioned work from an international team of\ncontributors specifically chosen for their expertise and knowledge in the field.\nIntroduced and contextualized by a leading subject specialist, they deliver a coherent\nand authoritative volume covering classic and current research, controversies and\ndebates, and future trends.\nHandbooks are primarily aimed at the international academic library market and are\nused (and sometimes individually purchased) by academics, researchers, and\npostgraduates. They are initially published in hardback with possible future paperback\npublication.\nOur premium digital reference site Routledge Handbooks Online provides institutional\naccess to our handbooks at chapter level, significantly expanding potential readership\nand discoverability.\nAs a potential handbook editor, please keep the following in mind when planning and\nproposing your book:\n\u2022 The anticipated structure of a handbook comprises a general introduction and\n35-40 chapters of approximately 8,000 words each, generally divided into\nsections, such as \u201cHistorical Perspectives,\u201d \u201cCore issues and Topics,\u201d \u201cNew\nDebates,\u201d and so on.\n\u2022 Handbooks have no general bibliography (only chapter references) and a\ndetailed index will be key. There will be no footnotes, but endnotes can be\naccommodated in each chapter. \nPage 4 of 5\nPage 4 of 5\n\u2022 There will be minimal use of illustrations and no inclusion of copyrighted\nmaterial.\n\u2022 An international line-up of contributors is strongly encouraged, including, where\npossible, authors from the UK, continental Europe, Asia, and the US.\nShort Form: \u201cFocus\u201d\nRoutledge/CRC Focus is our program of short form publications. Each book contains\nbetween 20,000 and 50,000 words (including notes and references). They offer a flexible\noption for situations where there is too much material for a journal article, but not\nenough for a full-length book.\nTheir length means that short form titles can potentially be published quicker than\nother types of book, often in as few as 12 weeks. This makes them ideal for responding\nrapidly to topical issues and current affairs. They are initially published in eBook and\nhardback at a competitive price.\nThis versatile format lends itself to a variety of topics and approaches, including:\n\u2022 A short overview of an emerging area or \u201chot topic\u201d\n\u2022 A detailed case-study\n\u2022 Reworking of research for a policy, professional or practitioner audience\n\u2022 Analytical or theoretical innovations\n\u2022 A timely response to current affairs or policy debates\n\u2022 Edited collection presenting multiple viewpoints\nThe format and turnaround time of short form titles offers a great opportunity for\nimpact. Focus titles sell globally into all our national and regional markets, to both\ninstitutions and individuals including scholars, students, researchers, professionals, and\npractitioners, as well as those working in think tanks and policy circles.\nAs a potential short form editor/author, please keep the following in mind when\nplanning and proposing your book:\n\u2022 There will be minimal use of illustrations and/or equations\n\u2022 Quicker than usual turnaround times will likely be requested to meet the short\nProduction schedule\nProfessional\nOur professional books combine high-level research and the latest scholarship for\napplication and practice, including as instructional material and reference. They are \nPage 5 of 5\nPage 5 of 5\nintended for practitioners such as mental health professionals, schoolteachers, and\nfilmmakers, as well as researchers working outside of university settings.\nTextbook\nIntended for use in undergraduate and graduate courses, we publish textbooks for both\nemerging and established subject areas. Our emphasis on pedagogy and text\ndevelopment, combined with lively and imaginative design, supports students with all\nthe information they need for their course, and guides them to further study and\nindependent learning.\nOur textbooks are broadly divided into two categories: (1) core texts, usually introducing\nand exploring key concepts, intended as the main book to be used by students in a\ncourse, and (2) supplementary texts, which often explore a specific aspect of a subject\nand may appeal to researchers in addition to students as further reading."

Using Lakatos' Philosophy of Science, we argue higher education has become a degenerating research programme, maintaining formal structures while abandoning educational substance. Drawing on evidence from an experimental AI-integrated unit at Macquarie University, we pose three interlocking questions: What constitutes content-increasing education when AI handles information transfer? How can universities reconnect education to meaningful world-making? What academic practices enable transformative rather than transactional learning? Student transformations documented in our unit suggest design principles for post-transactional universities that embrace productive failure, reward process mastery, and develop new capabilities beyond credentialism.\n\nRather than prescriptive solutions, we offer design principles derived from student experiences: rapidly transitioning between content and capability development; connecting learning to real-world impact; rewarding process mastery over outputs; embracing productive failure as pedagogy; and developing social proof beyond grades. The emperor's nakedness stands revealed. Universities must choose between maintaining elaborate fictions or embracing pedagogies suited to our AI-haunted world where students already see through credentialist illusions.}\n\n\n\n\\abstract{Towards an Evidence Based Framework for AI in Philosophy Education}{\\href{https://orcid.org/0009-0003-5278-6965}{Max Parks\\ExternalLink{}}{\\ensuremath{<}max.parks@mcc.edu\\ensuremath{>}}}{}{}{Widespread adoption of generative AI tools in higher education has raised questions about their appropriate role in philosophy instruction. This study investigated the comparative effectiveness of AI-assisted writing tools versus traditional writing center support in philosophy courses at two community colleges with approximately 100 participants. We tracked student performance across multiple measures including paper scores, exam performance, homework completion, and class participation. Students self-selected into using AI tools, the writing center, both, or neither for developing their term papers. Results showed that AI users performed slightly better on paper scores compared to writing center users (p = 0.043), though no significant differences emerged in other academic performance measures. However, qualitative analysis revealed concerning patterns in how students utilized AI, including inappropriate use for research and citation. While our findings suggest AI tools can serve complementary roles in supporting student learning when used appropriately, they also highlight the need for explicit instruction in AI literacy and careful consideration of how to preserve student agency and authentic philosophical engagement. Building on these empirical findings, we propose an ethical framework for AI integration in philosophy education centered on three principles: preserved agency, protected struggle, and demonstrated capability.}\n\n\\abstract{Teaching the Unknown: A Pedagogical Framework for Teaching With and About AI}{\\href{https://orcid.org/0009-0008-5389-1982}{Brian Ballsun-Stanton \\ExternalLink{}}{\\ensuremath{<}brian.ballsun-stanton@mq.edu.au\\ensuremath{>}}; {\\href{https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2754-0691}{Jodie Torrington \\ExternalLink{}}{\\ensuremath{<}jodie.torrington@mq.edu.au\\ensuremath{>}}}}{}{}{Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has disrupted education systems worldwide, exposing pre-existing pedagogical vulnerabilities while necessitating fundamental reconceptualisation of teaching practices. This disruption demands pedagogical approaches that embrace uncertainty while developing student agency amid technological indeterminacy. Traditional educational models predicated on stable knowledge transmission prove inadequate when confronting AI's emergent and probabilistic properties.\n\nThis study examined how decoupling task success from assessment outcomes created environments where students developed critical AI literacy through structured risk-taking and productive failure. Drawing on Transformative Learning Theory and Rumsfeld's epistemological Matrix as interpretive frameworks, we analysed an experimental undergraduate AI unit across three disciplinary streams: Ancient History, Philosophy, and Politics and International Relations ($N=23$). Data collection encompassed student reflections, classroom observations, and AI interaction logs throughout a 13-week semester.\n\nOur pedagogical framework operationalised four interconnected pillars. First, risk-embracing assessment structures valued reflection over output quality. Second, intentional classroom culture development proceeded through educator vulnerability and communal knowledge construction. Third, systematic navigation of technological uncertainty became a primary learning dimension. Fourth, facilitation of transformative learning experiences occurred through structured disorienting dilemmas. Students demonstrated measurable progression from external to internal AI locus of control, developing sophisticated understanding of when, how, and why to employ AI tools. Analysis revealed that humanities methodologies, particularly textual criticism and contextual evaluation, transfer systematically to AI contexts, challenging deficit-based professional development models.\n\nThis research presents implications across three levels: educational theory, where productive failure and epistemic uncertainty navigation challenge traditional knowledge progression models; educator praxis, recognising AI as a textual technology particularly suited to humanities expertise; and university teaching contexts, requiring new quality frameworks that prioritise process-focused assessment over demonstrable competency acquisition. Effective AI education requires sustained investment in psychological safety through formative assessment, access to frontier models rather than basic institutional offerings, and institutional support for pedagogical experimentation beyond traditional frameworks.}\n \n\n\n\n\\abstract{Ethnographic insights into AI Pedagogy for Higher Education: A Qualitative Study.}{\\href{https://orcid.org/0009-0008-5389-1982}{Francesca Martinelli\\ExternalLink{}}{\\ensuremath{<}Francescamartinelli02@gmail.com\\ensuremath{>}}}{}{}{This chapter presents findings from four months of ethnographic field work in an experimental arts capstone unit on AI at Macquarie University (2024). Guided by the research question, \\textit{\u201c\\textit{How does the intentional design of AI learning 'laboratories' transform students' AI-specific \u2018habitus\u2019 while demonstrating possibilities for cultural change in higher education?}\u201d} the study employs the concept of digital habitus (Romele 2023; Bourdieu 1977) to examine how the seminar facilitated a shift from students\u2019 initial apprehension, misconceptions, and mixed perceptions about AI toward technical proficiency and critical AI literacy; the capacity to move from passive, fearful consumers to informed collaborators who can evaluate AI capabilities and limitations, reflect on ethical implications across diverse contexts, and make deliberate choices about when and how to engage with AI tools. .\u00a0\n\nUniversities are increasingly seeking ways to integrate AI that enhance rather than erode education. Yet, quantitative global surveys paint a grim picture: only half of students regularly engage critically with AI tools and their output, while the rest admit to complacent or inappropriate use (Gillespie et al. 2025, p.94). More than 50\\% report concealing their use of AI to complete coursework, and a staggering 45\\% presented AI-generated content as their own (Gillespie et al. 2025). These figures draw the curtain on deeper issues long present in higher education: declining student engagement, credentialism, and the hollowing out of meaningful learning (Ballson-Stunton \\& Torrington 2025). Educational leaders are now calling for a reimagining of the sector, urging institutions to treat AI\u2019s advance as an opportunity for transformative change (Liu \\& Bates 2025; Ballson-Stunton \\& Khaled 2025).\u00a0\n\nAmid emerging scholarship that approaches AI pedagogy as a culturally situated process (Liu \\& Bates 2025; Ballson-Stunton \\& Torrington 2025), this chapter argues for the centrality of culture in shaping both the risks and possibilities of AI integration in higher education. Drawing on ethnographic data, it grounds Ballson-Stunton and Torrington\u2019s four-pillar framework for a pedagogy of AI in students\u2019 lived experiences, offering evidence for how intentionally designed classroom cultures can cultivate transparent, critical, and responsible engagement with AI in tertiary education. }\n\n\\subsectionbar{Case Studies}{Case Studies}\n\n \n\n\n\\abstract{AI's Applicability to the Legal Profession}{\\href{https://orcid.org/0009-0005-9194-262X}{Lianne Grace Mabborang Tacardon \\ExternalLink{}}{\\ensuremath{<}lianne.tacardon@students.mq.edu.au\\ensuremath{>}}}{}{}{Artificial intelligence\u2019s (\u2018AI\u2019) piecemeal introduction to the law is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the legal profession.

The likelihood of spreading legal misinformation is further exacerbated due to systemic American biases present in current language learning models (\u2018LLMs\u2019) \u2013 an issue encountered during my study of AI-Enabled Politics and International Relations (\u2018ARTX3500\u2019). It is therefore necessary that LLMs are subject to ongoing scrutiny and regulation by bodies responsible for their administration, with the impetus of eradicating inherent bias altogether. This case study will discuss insights garnered during the study of ARTX3500 concerning the use of AI in educational and personal contexts from a legal standpoint.

By documenting the process of creating both visual and literary art, the research demonstrates how specific language and personal intent can yield deeply meaningful and personal outputs. Ultimately, the study identifies three pivotal insights: AI\u2019s outputs are shaped by human intentionality; meaningful collaboration with AI requires curiosity and play; and ethical creativity in this new paradigm demands transparency and acknowledgment of AI as both tool and co-creator. Ultimately, this work challenges traditional notions of authorship and creativity, emphasizing the value of questioning biases, critically analyzing new tools, and embracing AI as a technological quill for modern artistic practice.}\n\n\n\n\\abstract{Grappling with uncertainty in AI use}{\\href{https://orcid.org/0009-0008-5389-1982}{Marina Maeve Mason \\ExternalLink{}}{\\ensuremath{<}marina.mason8@gmail.com\\ensuremath{>}}}{}{}{}\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\\abstract{Trust in our tools: a spectrum of AI utility }{\\href{https://orcid.org/0009-0004-1025-479X}{Luke Waked \\ExternalLink{}}{\\ensuremath{<}luke.waked@mq.edu.au\\ensuremath{>}}}{}{}{The unmonitored release of Large Language Models into educational contexts has created profound challenges around trust, utility, and academic integrity. This autoethnographic case study examines my personal transformation from AI sceptic to confident user, exploring how trust develops in human-AI relationships within educational settings. Drawing upon Martin Heidegger's tool analysis framework, I trace AI's evolution from \"present-at-hand\"\u2014a suspicious, constantly scrutinised other\u2014to \"ready-to-hand,\" an intuitive extension of my academic practice.\n\n \n\nThrough reflective analysis of my experiences in an experimental AI course, I demonstrate that AI trust is context, education, and application specific. Early teachings emphasised providing rich contextual information to combat AI's hallucinatory nature. As my understanding deepened through structured experimentation, my relationship with AI shifted from fearful avoidance to confident collaboration.\n\nTrust functions as a crucial moderator between AI integration and academic performance. When I began treating Claude as a 24/7 tutor\u2014sharing genuine academic anxieties while maintaining ethical boundaries\u2014the tool became ready-to-hand. My interactions evolved from formal, sceptical queries to casual conversations that maintained task focus while providing support. This transformation enabled more confident class participation, reduced procrastination, and improved learning outcomes.\n\nCritically, this Heideggerian transformation enhanced rather than diminished my critical thinking skills. With adequate training and trust development, AI became a tool that amplified my analytical capabilities rather than replacing them. The findings suggest educational institutions should foster informed trust through structured, context-rich integration. This case study demonstrates that AI's educational value depends not on the technology itself, but on developing appropriate trust relationships and teaching effective prompting that strengthen and broaden the realm of critical thinking through effective tool use.}\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\\abstract{Rethinking the Role of AI in University Learning}{\\href{https://orcid.org/0009-0008-5389-1982}{Jessica Ching Nga Cheung \\ExternalLink{}}{\\ensuremath{<}snownation928@gmail.com\\ensuremath{>}}}{}{}{This paper presents a case study of my personal study journey of integrating artificial\nintelligence (AI) in university, drawing on my experiences as an international student from Hong\nKong at Macquarie University (Australia). The study begins by exploring initial expectations and\nanxieties, shaped by limited access to AI tools in Hong Kong and general misconceptions about\nAI's capabilities. The narrative reveals the varied beliefs and practices surrounding AI in higher\neducation through hands-on engagement with large language models (LLMs) and observation\nof peers from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds.\n\nThe findings indicate a distinct contrast in students' approaches to AI. Those with a superficial\nunderstanding tend to rely heavily on AI, often leading to lower academic performance. In\ncontrast, students who thoughtfully utilise AI as a supplementary resource engage critically with\nthe technology and their subject matter, resulting in deeper learning and improved achievement.\nThe paper examines the importance of user agency, language background, and the reciprocal\nrelationship between user and machine in shaping the quality of AI-assisted work.\n\nPractical strategies for effective AI use are discussed, including prompt engineering, critical\nverification of outputs, and leveraging AI as a collaborative thinking partner. The study also\naddresses ethical and philosophical questions, such as data privacy, the impact of restrictive\npolicies like those in Hong Kong, and the need for balanced AI education that includes both\ntechnical and ethical dimensions.\n\nThe conclusion argues that AI is neither a replacement for human effort nor a threat to learning,\nbut a tool whose value depends on thoughtful, informed engagement. Empowering students\nwith access to AI and critical guidance is essential for preparing graduates for a future shaped\nby rapid technological change. This case study invites educators and policymakers to reflect on\nhow best to integrate AI into teaching and learning responsibly and effectively.}\n\n \n\n"

We have assembled a collection of chapters and case studies from an experimental AI-integrated unit at Macquarie University, with additional contributions from researchers in the US and Korea.\n\nThe symposium booklet containing abstracts for all current contributions is available at: https://zenodo.org/records/15741641, with a number of full chapters, extended abstracts, and student case studies available at the Zenodo community.\n\nIn this work, we offer evidence-based pedagogy, philosophy, and ethnographic observations of how students have transformed their thinking about AI. The work emphasizes humanities methodologies, particularly textual criticism and contextual evaluation, as they apply to AI within the university.\n\nTo give you a sense of my background in this area:\nMy ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4932-7912 and attached CV.\nRelevant publications include: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/1360080X.2025.2509187 and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44204-025-00247-1\nAnd a preprint besides the chapters above: https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/6mke5_v1 \n\nI believe this material would be a strong fit for your philosophy of technology series.

The work emphasizes humanities methodologies, particularly textual criticism and contextual evaluation, as they apply to AI within the university.\n\nTo give you a sense of my background in this area:\nMy ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4932-7912 and attached CV.\nRelevant publications include: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/1360080X.2025.2509187 and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44204-025-00247-1\nAnd a preprint besides the chapters above: https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/6mke5_v1 \n\nI believe this material would be a strong fit for your philosophy of technology series. Could you advise on next steps for submitting a formal proposal for peer review?\n\nCheers,\n-Brian",
