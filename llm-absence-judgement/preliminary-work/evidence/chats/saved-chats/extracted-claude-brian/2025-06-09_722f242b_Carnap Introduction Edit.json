By this framework, we mean a digital scholasticism that privileges textual authorities over critical assessment of knowledge claims. This approach draws parallels to the medieval scholastic tradition described by Horden, in which \"what mattered more than any clear-cut distinction between \\textit{scientia} and \\textit{magica} were the questions of value and authority. Did these exceptional techniques have beneficial effects, and did the reports of their effects come from good sources?\" \\parencite*[Section 3]{horden_medieval_2011}. Like medieval scholastics, LLMs rely on authoritative texts rather than empirical investigation, emphasise reconciling conflicting sources through logical distinctions, and treat formatting, publisher, structural markers, and the presence of citations as indicators of authority. \n\nContemporary AI research tools replicate these scholastic priorities due to their inability to iterate with feedback from reality, their inability to evaluate the credibility of claims within the context of broader tacit knowledge, and their deference toward well-formatted and longer sources. Knowledge generation is not merely the accumulation of observations until we choose to call something a fact in the Carnapian sense. It requires noticing meaningful parallels and judging which connections are significant, precisely the capabilities that technoscholasticism precludes.\n\nCarnap\\footnote{We are not claiming a positivist or relativist position in the demarcation problem of the philosophy of science. Rather we are claiming that AI ``agents'' operate in the most na\\\"ive possible evidence collection mode, mapping to a simplistic reading of Carnap \\parencite[][]{bright_carnap_2019, bright_carnaps_2022}.} proposed that \"instead of verification, we may speak of gradually increasing confirmation of the law\" \\parencite[425]{carnap_testability_1936} through accumulating observations. LLMs, in their reasoning, speak about confirming evidence. Setting aside the rigour in observation that Carnap demanded, he describes his positivist philosophy of science as:\n\\begin{quote}\nIn order to test a theory we derive predictions with its help; then we observe whether and to what extent the facts bear out the predictions, and these results are taken as the basis for our judgment of the theory. (p. 520)\n\\end{quote}\nAn AI's theory is merely the user's prompt constrained by the system prompt and implemented with LLMs calling tools in a loop. An AI has the basis of what it is searching for, it searches to find confirmatory evidence, and then uses the evidence to support or refine (but never \\textit{judge}) the initial theory. The research these ``agents'' perform is more like Rutherford's stamp-collecting through evidence accumulation to prove the already-known points.\n\n% ## Paragraph 4: Research Approach and Paper Organization (~200 words)\n\nOur investigation employs an autoethnographic approach, examining firsthand experiences with frontier models between February and May 2025 to address the question: How well can an LLM, using a 'research' workflow, assist in performing research? We interpret these experiences through the lens of technoscholasticism, examining not just simple authority deference but deeper epistemological limitations: the inability to apply a \"does this make sense?\" filter to texts, the failure to evaluate whether sources could legitimately know what they claim to know, and the fundamental disconnect from experiential knowledge. Throughout this paper, we analyse the judgement deficiency in current systems, evaluate their capabilities for mundane utility despite these limitations, and propose requirements for truly effective research tools that acknowledge and compensate for these inherent constraints. By understanding these systems' limitations through the framework of technoscholasticism, researchers can develop more realistic expectations and more effective approaches to incorporating these tools into scholarly practice."
