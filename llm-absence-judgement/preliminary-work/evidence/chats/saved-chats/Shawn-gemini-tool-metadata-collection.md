"FAIMS","FAIMS (Field Acquired Information Management Systems) is an open-source digital platform designed for collecting, managing, and sharing born-digital data in field-based research, primarily archaeology, but applicable to other historical and environmental sciences. The current version, FAIMS 3.0, is a cross-platform system (iOS, Android, web) allowing researchers to design highly customised data collection modules using a web-based interface without requiring programming skills. These modules can enforce complex validation logic, manage relational data, capture diverse data types (text, images, GPS, sketches), and support offline data entry with subsequent synchronisation to a project-specific server. Previous versions, FAIMS 1.0 (released c. 2013\) and FAIMS 2.0 (c. 2016), were Android-native applications focusing on robust offline data capture and customisability through XML configurations. FAIMS 3.0 significantly expands on this by offering a more user-friendly module creation process, broader platform support, and enhanced data management capabilities, aiming to improve data quality, consistency, and FAIRness in research. It has been used in numerous archaeological projects globally, for survey, excavation, and artefact analysis.","The FAIMS project began in 2012 with funding from the Australian National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) project, leading to FAIMS 1.0, first deployed in 2013\. This initial version was an Android-native system for offline field data collection, developed primarily at Macquarie University and the University of New South Wales. It focused on customisable forms using XML. FAIMS 2.0 (also known as 'Agl Dbh'), released circa 2016, built upon this foundation, enhancing stability, versioning, and offline-first capabilities, still primarily for Android. It received further support from Australian Research Council Linkage Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities (ARC LIEF) grants. Development of FAIMS 3.0 commenced around 2019, driven by the need for cross-platform support (iOS, Android, web), a more intuitive module builder, and a modern technology stack. FAIMS 3.0 was officially launched with stable releases in 2022/2023 (e.g., Ross et al. 2023 'Open Archaeology'), representing a complete rewrite. It adopted a server-client architecture with a web-based interface for module design and data management, and mobile apps for field collection. Continuous development has added features and improved stability, with version 3.10.0 released in November 2023.","FAIMS 3.0 employs a modular architecture. The mobile client is developed with React Native, enabling cross-platform deployment on iOS and Android. It supports offline data collection, synchronising with a central server when connectivity is available. The server component uses Node.js with an Express.js framework, typically employing PostgreSQL for data storage, though SQLite is an option for local or small-scale deployments. Module creation in FAIMS 3.0 occurs via a web-based 'Module Builder' (a React application), which allows users to define data schemas, forms, validation rules, and relationships without direct coding; this process generates JSON configurations for the mobile app. Data is stored as structured JSON within the app and synchronised to the server's relational database. The system accommodates various field types, including text, numbers, controlled vocabularies, GPS coordinates (with basic map display), photos, sketches, and relational links between records. FAIMS 3.0 supports versioning of records and data schemas. User authentication and role-based access control are managed server-side. In contrast, earlier versions (FAIMS 1.x and 2.x) were Android-native Java applications using XML for module configuration and SQLite for local data storage. FAIMS 2.0 notably featured sophisticated record versioning and branching. FAIMS 3.0 prioritises ease of module creation and cross-platform support. Data export options in FAIMS 3.0 include CSV and JSON, with ongoing development for expanded format support and API access.","2023-12-08","yes","FAIMS 3.0 meets all essential criteria for research software: it is designed for research-specific field data collection (Essential 1), directly engages with creating and managing primary research data (Essential 2), and aligns with archaeological and related field methodologies (Essential 3). It also satisfies multiple supporting criteria, including strong domain knowledge integration through customisable modules (Supporting 1), support for data acquisition and processing stages of the research lifecycle (Supporting 2), transformation of data through structured input and export formats (Supporting 3), extensive documentation focused on research applications (Supporting 6), and core data collection capabilities (Supporting 7).","https://github.com/FAIMS","","","https://faims.org/","GPL-3.0","Data collection|Data management|Spatial analysis|Archaeogenetics|Zooarchaeology|Palaeobotany|Artefact morphology|Lithic analysis|Ceramic analysis|Public archaeology","Field data collection|Mobile data capture|Customisable forms|Offline data entry|Archaeological informatics","2013-04-01","2023-11-15","3.10.0","Active","Macquarie University|University of New South Wales|Australian Research Council|National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources","Shawn Ross|Brian Ballsun-Stanton|Adela Sobotkova|Penny Crook|Petra Janouchova|J.

For FAIMS 3.0 as of December 2023, the GitHub organization shows moderate activity: \`faims3-mobile-app\` has 11 stars, 10 forks, and 13 contributors; \`faims3-server\` has 7 stars, 6 forks, and 9 contributors. The primary publication for FAIMS 3.0 (Ross et al. 2023, 'Open Archaeology') has 12 citations (Google Scholar). Adoption of FAIMS 3.0 is actively promoted through training workshops and its use is documented in emerging archaeological projects. Macquarie University provides significant institutional support and hosts instances. The FAIMS website highlights case studies and publications, indicating a sustained user community transitioning to or adopting the new version.","Data Acquisition|Processing|Data management","research-specific","Stand-alone software","JavaScript|TypeScript|Node.js|React Native|Python","Android|iOS|Web|Linux|Windows|macOS","","FAIMS 3.0 supports data export in CSV and JSON formats. Modules can be designed by users to structure data according to specific standards if required. The server component is planned to offer APIs for enhanced data access and interoperability with other systems in future development. Internally, data is stored in a PostgreSQL or SQLite database. Previous versions like FAIMS 2.0 provided robust export capabilities to various formats including relational SQLite databases, CSV, and basic KML. FAIMS 3.0 uses structured JSON for its internal data handling and primary export format, which is readily convertible. Direct integration with external GIS or statistical packages typically requires data export first.","The current version, FAIMS 3.0, offers significant strengths: cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, web); an intuitive, web-based module builder enabling complex customisation without programming. It features robust offline data collection with reliable synchronisation. The system supports complex data structures, inter-record relationships, and sophisticated validation rules, enhancing data quality at the point of capture. As an open-source project (GPL-3.0), it fosters transparency and potential community contributions. FAIMS benefits from strong, long-term institutional backing and a development history that addresses archaeological user needs. The platform is designed to support FAIR data principles by facilitating the creation of born-digital, structured, and well-described research data. Legacy versions (FAIMS 1 & 2\) established a reputation for robustness in demanding field environments.","While FAIMS 3.0 is a mature product, it is a newer iteration than its predecessors; some advanced features from FAIMS 2.0 (e.g., granular versioning and data branching) are still being fully realised in the new architecture. Performance of the mobile application with extremely large datasets or highly complex relational structures on lower-specification devices may present challenges, a common issue for mobile data systems. Although module creation is code-free, designing effective, complex modules necessitates careful data management planning. Full functionality relies on a server for data synchronisation, user management, and module distribution; this requires projects to establish or access a server instance, potentially a hurdle for teams without dedicated technical support, though local server setups are feasible for individual users or small teams.","FAIMS demonstrates high survivability. Its open-source nature (GPL-3.0) mitigates vendor lock-in and allows for community-driven continuation if primary institutional development were to cease. The project benefits from sustained institutional support from Macquarie University, including its eResearch division, and has a successful history of securing ARC LIEF grant funding. The core development team comprises established academics in digital archaeology, indicating a long-term commitment. The adoption of modern, widely-used technologies (React Native, Node.js) for FAIMS 3.0 lowers the barrier for new developers to contribute. A substantial existing user base from previous versions and the growing adoption of FAIMS 3.0 signify ongoing community demand and relevance. However, similar to many academic software initiatives, its long-term maintenance and advancement are subject to the continuity of grant funding and institutional commitment.","Key alternatives include Open Data Kit (ODK) and its derivatives like KoBoToolbox and ONA, which provide similar mobile data collection functionalities, often with a strong emphasis on humanitarian and development sectors. EpiCollect5 is another established tool for mobile data collection. For field data collection with a strong GIS focus, QField (for QGIS users) or ESRI's ArcGIS Survey123 and ArcGIS Field Maps are prominent. Historically, bespoke database solutions, often built with FileMaker Pro, have also been common in archaeology. FAIMS distinguishes itself through its specific design considerations for archaeological fieldwork, the powerful yet code-free module builder in FAIMS 3.0 catering to complex research designs, and its integrated server-client system tailored for academic research workflows and FAIR data principles."
