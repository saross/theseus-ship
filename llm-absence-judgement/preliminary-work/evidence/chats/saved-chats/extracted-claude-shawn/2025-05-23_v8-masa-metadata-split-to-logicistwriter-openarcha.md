## Introduction

MASA (Mémoires des Archéologues et des Sites Archéologiques) represents a comprehensive digital ecosystem developed to support archaeological research in France. Established in 2012, this consortium operates under the certification of Huma-Num, the French Very Large Research Infrastructure for digital humanities. MASA delivers an integrated suite of tools that enable archaeologists to manage, standardise, analyse, and publish their research data in accordance with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

The consortium addresses a fundamental challenge in archaeological research: the heterogeneity of data formats, recording methods, and terminology that often prevents effective data sharing and reuse. By implementing semantic web technologies and domain-specific ontologies, MASA provides a structured framework for archaeological data integration that preserves contextual relationships while enabling cross-dataset queries.

## Ecosystem Components

MASA's digital ecosystem comprises three primary tools that work in concert to support the archaeological research lifecycle:

### OpenArchaeo

OpenArchaeo functions as a semantic web platform that enables interoperability between heterogeneous archaeological datasets through CIDOC CRM ontology mapping. The platform features two distinct interfaces:

1. A technical SPARQL endpoint that provides programmers and data specialists with direct query capabilities
2. The SPARNATURAL visual query builder that allows archaeologists without technical expertise to construct complex semantic queries through an intuitive graphical interface

This dual-interface approach democratises access to archaeological data while maintaining the technical rigour required for semantic web implementation. OpenArchaeo incorporates specialised archaeological extensions of CIDOC CRM (CRMarchaeo, CRMsci, CRMba) to capture the specific needs of archaeological documentation.

### LogicistWriter

LogicistWriter implements the logicist philosophy pioneered by J.C. Gardin in the 1970s, which aims to clarify reasoning processes in archaeology and explore new publication forms. This tool enables archaeologists to:

- Visually map inference chains through a graph-based interface
- Generate XML-TEI structured documents with embedded reasoning diagrams
- Create interactive publications that link archaeological interpretations directly to supporting field evidence
- Map reasoning processes to the CRMinf extension for representing scientific inference

This approach addresses the growing imbalance between publication volume and researchers' assimilation capacities by providing structured access to archaeological reasoning.

### OpenGuide

OpenGuide serves as an online platform for publishing and distributing best practice guides for archaeological data management. The system:

- Converts standard document formats into structured XML-TEI
- Provides web-accessible documentation on data standards and methods
- Supports the consistent application of practices across the archaeological community
- Offers downloadable guides in multiple formats (HTML, PDF)

Together, these tools form a complete workflow from field data acquisition through standardisation, analysis, and publication.

## Historical Development

MASA emerged from experiences acquired within several Maisons des Sciences de l'Homme (MSH) regarding the processing of archaeological documentation. The consortium's development can be traced through several distinct phases:

**Establishment (2012)**: MASA was founded with seven institutional partners focused on preserving archaeologists' archives and archaeological site data.

**First Phase (2013-2016)**: During this period, the consortium concentrated on processing archaeological corpora from digitisation to publication. Partners pooled their expertise to address the discipline's specific challenges, particularly the irreproducible nature of archaeological excavation and the heterogeneity of archaeological databases.

**Second Phase (2016-2022)**: MASA developed semantic web tools, particularly OpenArchaeo, in partnership with SPARNA company (led by Thomas Francart) and the Laboratoire d'Informatique Fondamentale et Appliquée de Tours (LIFAT). This phase saw significant technical advancement in data mapping and query interfaces.

**Evolution to MASAplus (2023-present)**: In 2023, MASA evolved into MASAplus, expanding its partnerships to ten institutions and broadening its scope within digital archaeology. Throughout its development, MASA has collaborated with European initiatives including the ARIADNE and ARIADNEplus projects and COST SEADDA (Saving European Archaeology from the Digital Dark Age).

## Technical Implementation

The MASA ecosystem employs a sophisticated technical architecture centred on semantic web standards and domain-specific ontologies. At its core, OpenArchaeo utilises a triplestore database containing archaeological data mapped to CIDOC CRM and its extensions. This implementation facilitates complex queries across datasets that were originally structured in different formats.

The SPARNATURAL component, developed by Thomas Francart of SPARNA, represents a particularly innovative technical contribution. This system translates user interactions with a graphical interface into valid SPARQL queries, enabling non-technical users to interrogate complex semantic data without specialised knowledge. The component has gained recognition beyond archaeology, with implementations at major French cultural institutions including the National Archives and National Library.

LogicistWriter employs XML-TEI technology to map archaeological reasoning chains through a graph-based interface. The system automatically generates SVG visualisations of inference structures from the underlying XML document, providing interactive publications that connect reasoning with supporting evidence.

All MASA tools rely on standardised vocabulary repositories to ensure terminological consistency:

- PACTOLS thesaurus for archaeological terminology
- GeoNames for spatial data standardisation
- PeriodO for temporal reference
- VIAF and ORCID for researcher and organisation identification

This comprehensive approach to data standardisation enables meaningful integration of archaeological information from diverse sources while preserving the contextual relationships that are essential to archaeological interpretation.

## Research Software Qualification

MASA definitively qualifies as research software based on multiple criteria from the evaluation framework. The consortium's tools meet all essential criteria:

1. **Research-Specific Purpose**: MASA tools are expressly designed to support archaeological research activities through specialised data transformation and publication tools.
2. **Research Data Engagement**: The ecosystem meaningfully transforms archaeological materials through semantic mapping and structured inference representation.
3. **Methodological Alignment**: The implementation aligns with established archaeological methodologies, particularly in field documentation and interpretive practice.

Additionally, MASA meets numerous supporting criteria:

- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: The system incorporates specialised archaeological terminology through the PACTOLS thesaurus and CIDOC CRM extensions.
- **Research Lifecycle Support**: MASA supports multiple research stages from data acquisition to publication and preservation.
- **Data Transformation**: The platform provides robust capabilities for converting between formats and representations through ontological mapping.
- **Analytical Capabilities**: OpenArchaeo's query tools enable sophisticated pattern recognition and comparison across datasets.
- **Documentation Focus**: All system documentation explicitly addresses archaeological research applications.

This comprehensive alignment with research software criteria reflects MASA's development within a specifically archaeological context, addressing the particular challenges of this discipline.

## Institutional Context and Usage

MASA benefits from strong institutional backing across the French archaeological research landscape. The consortium currently includes ten partner institutions:

- TGIR Huma-Num (Very Large Research Infrastructure for Digital Humanities)
- MSH Val de Loire (Maison des Sciences de l'Homme Val de Loire)
- Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée
- MSH Mondes
- MRSH de Caen (Maison de la Recherche en Sciences Humaines de Caen)
- Maison méditerranéenne des sciences de l'homme
- Maison Interuniversitaire des Sciences de l'Homme - Alsace
- INRAP (Institut national de recherches archéologiques préventives)
- GDS Frantiq
- Musée d'archéologie Nationale

This institutional network provides both stability and diverse expertise to the project. The consortium is led by a core development team of approximately 10-15 researchers and engineers, with Olivier Marlet (UMR 7324 CITERES – LAT) serving as the primary coordinator.

Usage indicators demonstrate significant adoption within the French archaeological community. The OpenArchaeo platform hosts multiple archaeological datasets, including:

- ArSol (Soil Archives database from the Laboratoire Archéologie et Territoires)
- RITA (Research in Image - Tours Archeologic)
- CERAMique (Information on Medieval and Modern ceramic typologies)

The consortium regularly conducts training workshops with consistent participation, demonstrating active community engagement. Publications about MASA tools appear in respected venues, including Computer Applications in Archaeology (CAA) conferences and specialised semantic web workshops like ODOCH (Open Data and Ontologies for Cultural Heritage).

## Strengths and Limitations

### Strengths

MASA's primary strengths derive from its comprehensive approach to archaeological data management:

- The platform's implementation of CIDOC CRM provides robust semantic interoperability that preserves the contextual richness essential to archaeological interpretation.
- SPARNATURAL's visual query interface democratises access to complex semantic data without requiring technical expertise.
- Strong institutional backing across multiple French research organisations ensures stability and ongoing development.
- The system's commitment to FAIR principles and open science standards makes it a model for digital archaeological practice.
- Modular design allows archaeologists to adopt components selectively based on specific needs.

### Limitations

Despite its significant achievements, MASA faces several challenges:

- Limited adoption outside France due to language barriers and cultural specificity in archaeological terminology.
- The complexity of semantic web technologies presents a steep learning curve for new users, requiring significant training investment.
- While based on international standards, MASA's implementation remains primarily focused on French archaeological practices.
- Complete implementation requires multiple tools and significant technical expertise, limiting adoption by smaller archaeological projects with limited resources.
- The requirement for data mapping to CIDOC CRM presents an initial barrier that may discourage some potential users.

## Sustainability Assessment

MASA demonstrates strong survivability potential due to several factors:

- Institutional backing by Huma-Num and multiple French research institutions provides stable funding and support.
- Successful transition from MASA to MASAplus in 2023 indicates ongoing development commitment.
- Integration with European initiatives like ARIADNEplus creates international visibility and additional sustainability pathways.
- Active community of users and regular training sessions establish a support network that contributes to long-term viability.
- Modular ecosystem design allows for component-by-component updates without requiring complete system overhauls.
- Ongoing collaboration with commercial partners like SPARNA indicates industry interest that could support future development.

Comparable alternatives exist but with different emphases. The UK's Archaeology Data Service (ADS) provides similar digital archive functions but with less emphasis on semantic web technologies. The US-based tDAR offers comparable repository services but lacks MASA's semantic integration capabilities. ResearchSpace, developed by the British Museum, provides similar semantic web interfaces but focuses more on museum collections than field archaeology.

## Conclusion

MASA represents a significant contribution to digital archaeological practice, particularly in implementing semantic web technologies for archaeological data integration. Its development illustrates the value of consistent institutional support and domain-specific adaptation of general semantic web standards. While primarily focused on French archaeology, the consortium's approach offers valuable lessons for similar initiatives internationally. The continued evolution from MASA to MASAplus demonstrates both the sustainability of the project and its adaptability to changing research needs and technologies.
