Hi Claude, We are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.

I understand the task completely. You'd like me to collect and organize comprehensive metadata about research software tools used in archaeology, history, and related historical disciplines according to the detailed framework provided.

The prompt includes clear instructions for:
- Conducting thorough, accurate research
- Following specific metadata collection standards
- Organizing information into a well-formed CSV with defined fields
- Evaluating tools against the Research Software Tool Definition criteria

I'm ready to begin this process. Please provide me with the name or acronym of the first tool you'd like me to research, and I'll gather the required metadata following the guidelines you've provided.
