"Intrasis","Intrasis (Intra-site Information System) is a specialized Geographic Information System designed specifically for archaeological documentation and data management. The current version integrates database functionality with spatial analysis capabilities, allowing archaeologists to document, manage, visualize, and analyze complex excavation data in a unified environment. Intrasis serves as a comprehensive solution that bridges the gap between geographical mapping and detailed excavation records, enabling users to document entire excavation processes from field recording to analysis and publication. The system excels at establishing relationships between different archaeological elements such as finds, contexts, samples, and spatial features, with particularly strong capabilities for quickly answering complex queries about connections between archaeological entities. Previous versions maintained the same core functionality but with more limited capabilities in multi-user environments and 3D integration.","Intrasis was developed by the archaeological unit at the Swedish National Heritage Board between 1998 and 2000, with the first commercial release in 2001. The software was created to address the need for a standardized digital documentation system that could handle both geographical data and complex archaeological information in an integrated environment. The system has evolved through several major versions: Intrasis 1.0 (2001) was the initial commercial release; Intrasis 2.0 added improved GIS functionality using Microsoft SQL Server as backend; Intrasis 3.0 represented a significant change with migration to PostgreSQL database system; Intrasis 3.2 is the current major version with compatibility for newer ArcGIS and PostgreSQL versions. A significant development milestone occurred in 2015 when ownership transferred to the National Historical Museums of Sweden when the contract archaeology unit separated from the National Heritage Board. Recent feature additions include enhanced support for multi-user environments, improved import wizards, and most notably, Intrasis 3D for integration with three-dimensional models.","Intrasis employs a client-server architecture built on established commercial and open-source technologies. The current version 3.2 utilizes PostgreSQL database (versions 9.2, 9.6, or 11.2) for data storage, a transition from Microsoft SQL Server used in earlier versions. This database stores the archaeological attribute data, while geographical information is maintained as ESRI shapefiles. The software requires ArcGIS (compatible with versions 10.3, 10.7, or 10.8) for spatial data processing and visualization, creating a dependency on this commercial GIS platform. This tight coupling enables real-time visualization of archaeological data on maps and plans, with seamless transitions between attribute data and spatial representations. The underlying data model follows an object-oriented approach where archaeological entities (finds, contexts, samples) are represented as objects with attributes and relationships. This metadata-driven system allows customization of data structures to fit specific project needs, adapting to various archaeological methodologies. Projects are organized as individual databases containing all relevant information for a single excavation. The system architecture consists of two primary components: Intrasis Explorer for data import and registration, and Intrasis Analysis for specialized GIS analysis of archaeological data. This separation allows for efficient workflows where field data can be processed through Explorer and then analyzed through more advanced GIS operations in Analysis. The system runs exclusively on Windows operating systems (Windows 7 or 10) and has additional dependencies including Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable when using PostgreSQL on Windows systems. For file formats, current versions support importing survey data in multiple formats (ISD, GSI, ESRI shapefile, Intrasis XYZ), tabular data (Excel, text files, dBase), 3D models (Wavefront OBJ), and various document types, with corresponding export capabilities for ESRI shapefiles, Excel spreadsheets, and text files.","2025-05-08","yes","Intrasis meets all essential criteria for a research software tool. It is specifically designed for archaeological research with a focus on field documentation and spatial analysis (Essential Criterion 1). It directly transforms archaeological data through specialized import and analysis functions (Essential Criterion 2). It aligns with established methodologies in archaeological fieldwork and GIS analysis (Essential Criterion 3). For supporting criteria, it integrates domain knowledge through specialized archaeological terminology and classification systems (Supporting Criterion 1), supports multiple stages of the research lifecycle from data collection to publication (Supporting Criterion 2), offers substantial data transformation capabilities between field recordings and GIS formats (Supporting Criterion 3), provides analytical capabilities for spatial and relationship analysis (Supporting Criterion 4), includes visualization functions for mapping and spatial data (Supporting Criterion 5), features extensive documentation focused on archaeological applications (Supporting Criterion 6), and supports comprehensive data collection in field settings (Supporting Criterion 7).","","","","https://www.intrasis.com/","Commercial","Spatial analysis|Site mapping|Data management|Data collection|Artefact morphology","Archaeological GIS|Excavation documentation|Spatial database|Swedish heritage|Cultural resource management","2001","2024-12","3.2 revision 6457","Active","National Historical Museums of Sweden","Swedish National Heritage Board (original developer), National Historical Museums of Sweden (current maintainer)","Medium (6-20)","Archaeology","General-purpose","Excellent","Intrasis is most widely adopted in Scandinavian countries, particularly Sweden, where it has become the standard for archaeological documentation. Since April 2000, it has been used for all archaeological excavations conducted by the archaeological unit of the Swedish National Heritage Board, and today it is used by all major archaeological institutions in Sweden. Notable international implementations include: Norway (used for the Kaupang excavations 2000-2003 and adopted by Norwegian university museums), Denmark (used for urban excavations in cities like Ribe), and the United Kingdom (implemented by English Heritage in 2009). Usage metrics show consistent institutional adoption rather than a broad community user base, with implementation primarily through organizational decisions rather than individual user choices. The software's usage pattern reflects its specialized nature and commercial licensing model. While exact user numbers are not publicly available, its status as the standard documentation system for multiple national heritage organizations indicates substantial usage within institutional contexts. The software is regularly updated with the most recent features focused on improving 3D integration and compatibility with newer versions of dependent software.","Data Acquisition|Processing|Analysis","research-specific","Stand-alone software","Not specified","Windows","","The current version supports importing measurement files from various instruments including total stations and GPS devices, with compatibility for multiple formats (ISD, GSI, ESRI shapefiles, and XYZ). It also offers data export functionality in formats including ESRI shapefiles, Excel spreadsheets, text files, and layouts for print output. The software can handle diverse archaeological data types including geographical measurements, attribute information, documents, images, and with version 3D, three-dimensional models. Interoperability with other GIS software is primarily through standard GIS file formats, particularly ESRI shapefiles. For database interaction, the system supports import/export operations with tabular data formats like Excel and text files. Earlier versions had more limited interoperability options, particularly for 3D data integration which has been enhanced in the latest releases.","Intrasis's greatest strength lies in its specialized design for archaeological documentation workflows, created by archaeologists for archaeologists. The current version excels at integrating database functionality with GIS capabilities in a single environment, allowing users to manage both spatial and attribute data without switching between multiple software packages. Its relationship management capabilities are particularly valuable, providing quick answers to complex queries about connections between archaeological objects, which is essential for archaeological interpretation and understanding contexts. The current version's customizability allows creation of unique databases for each project with customizable metadata, adapting to specific methodological approaches. The software effectively supports interdisciplinary data integration, combining diverse datasets such as osteological analysis and paleoecological data with archaeological information. For current users, the institutional backing from the National Historical Museums of Sweden ensures ongoing development and reliable support, while comprehensive documentation and training programs facilitate implementation despite the learning curve. Earlier versions shared these core strengths but with more limited customization options and less refined user interfaces.","The current version's most significant limitation is its dependency on proprietary software, specifically ArcGIS, which increases overall costs and creates reliance on another commercial product's continued support and compatibility. Platform restrictions represent another major limitation, as the software runs only on Windows operating systems, lacking cross-platform compatibility for Mac or Linux users. Language support is currently limited to English, though the system is designed to potentially support additional languages in future. Technical issues with data format compatibility have been documented in current and previous versions, including problems with date formats and challenges in ensuring conformity to international standards of data recording and archiving. The licensing model, requiring software purchase and potentially volume licensing for institutional use, presents cost barriers compared to open-source alternatives. The current version requires substantial training for effective use, with multiple course levels offered by the developers, indicating a significant learning curve. While the introduction of Intrasis 3D has addressed some 3D documentation limitations, the implementation is relatively new and not as mature as other aspects of the system. Previous versions had additional limitations in multi-user support and performance with large datasets that have been partially addressed in more recent releases.","Intrasis's long-term viability is supported by its ongoing development and institutional backing from the National Historical Museums of Sweden. The regular updates and addition of new features like 3D functionality demonstrate a commitment to keeping the software relevant. Current version compatibility with the latest technology standards and continuous maintenance suggest good mid-term prospects. However, several factors challenge its long-term dominance. The current version's reliance on proprietary technology (ArcGIS) creates risk if licensing models change or if ESRI discontinues support for components Intrasis depends on. The dependency on specific versions of PostgreSQL adds another layer of vulnerability. The Windows-only platform restriction may become increasingly problematic as computing environments diversify. The growing availability of open-source alternatives represents perhaps the most significant threat to Intrasis's market position, especially as these alternatives mature. The cost difference between Intrasis (requiring software purchase, ArcGIS license, and specific hardware/OS) and open-source alternatives is substantial, potentially influencing institutional adoption decisions, particularly for organizations with limited budgets. The software's future likely depends on its ability to adapt to changing technology landscapes while maintaining its specialized archaeological functionality and institutional relationships.","Several alternatives exist for archaeological documentation and spatial analysis. ARK (Archaeological Recording Kit) is an open-source web-based toolkit that requires only a browser, eliminating the need for specialized software installation, and integrates with QGIS through specialized plugins. OpenAtlas provides a web-based database system built on international standards (CIDOC CRM ontology) with a focus on FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Ishtar is an open-source project with a modular design organized around specific professional needs, featuring multi-user levels with precise access rights. Arches is a comprehensive platform developed by the Getty Conservation Institute and World Monuments Fund with strong institutional backing. QGIS with Archaeological Plugins offers a free, cross-platform GIS solution with specialized plugins for archaeological needs. These alternatives generally offer advantages in cross-platform compatibility, open-source licensing (reducing cost barriers), and web-based interfaces, but may lack the comprehensive integration and specialized archaeological focus of Intrasis. The institutional backing and established workflows built around Intrasis in Scandinavian countries provide it with advantages in those regions despite the growing alternatives."
