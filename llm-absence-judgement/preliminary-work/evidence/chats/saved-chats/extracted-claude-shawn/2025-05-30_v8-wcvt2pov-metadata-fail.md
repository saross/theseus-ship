Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. 

A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 

Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt. Consult the 'Tool disambiguation' section in particular if you have questions about the exact tool you are investigating.

Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.

I understand your requirements completely. I'll be collecting metadata about research software tools in archaeology, history, and other historical disciplines following the detailed prompt provided. I'll apply the Writing Style Guide to all content and follow the title convention format of "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" for my report.

I won't ask follow-up questions and will proceed directly with researching the tool you specify. I'll consult the 'Tool disambiguation' section if there are questions about which exact tool I should be investigating.

I'm ready to begin researching the first tool you'd like me to investigate. Please provide the name or acronym.

I'll research "Wcvt2Pov" as a potential archaeological research software tool. This appears to be a specialized tool name that may require thorough investigation to understand its purpose and applications. Let me begin my research process right away.

Your archaeological software search results are ready. After extensive research across academic databases and software repositories, no evidence was found for a tool named "Wcvt2Pov" in archaeological contexts. The report examines the POV-Ray ecosystem in archaeology, legacy software preservation challenges, and provides possible explanations for why this tool cannot be located. Alternative POV-Ray converters and next steps for verification are included.
