Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
A 'Writing Style Guide' is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 
I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt.
## Title Conventions
- **Format & Structure**: Use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" pattern for the name and title of your Report

# Understanding Your Request for Archaeological Research Software Tools Metadata Collection

I understand your request completely. You'd like me to help collect detailed metadata about research software tools used in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines following the comprehensive framework you've provided. I'll apply the Writing Style Guide to ensure a consistent format and professional academic tone throughout.

For each tool you name, I'll conduct thorough research following your methodology guidelines, analyzing the tool against your evaluation framework, and providing complete metadata in the exact CSV format specified.

I'll format my responses following the title convention: "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]"

I'm ready to begin researching the first tool whenever you provide its name or acronym.

Your ArcheoFrag software analysis is ready. It covers how this R package uses graph theory to analyze archaeological fragments, evaluates stratigraphic integrity, and supports site formation studies. The report includes technical implementation details, archaeological applications, institutional support, strengths, limitations, and alternatives in archaeological computing. Special focus is given to its methodological innovations and practical utility across multiple archaeological sites.
