Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. 

A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 

Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt. Consult the 'Tool disambiguation' section in particular if you have questions about the exact tool you are investigating.

Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.

I understand the requirements completely. I'll use the provided writing style guide and follow the research approach outlined in the prompt to collect comprehensive metadata about research software tools in archaeology and historical studies.

I'll adhere to the title conventions using the "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template, maintaining an academic tone while avoiding sensationalist language.

I won't ask follow-up questions and will execute the prompt as directed, consulting the tool disambiguation section if needed to identify the correct software when names are ambiguous.

I'm ready to begin the research process on the first tool you provide.

Your archaeological software research is complete. The investigation found no evidence that "PyCoCu" exists as an archaeological tool, despite thorough searches across academic databases, software repositories, and community forums. Several similarly-named tools were identified in other fields (PyCoTools, PyCoCuMa), but none related to archaeology. The report details legitimate archaeological Python tools and suggests possible explanations for the confusion.

Thanks, inability to find some tools is expected, since the tool list was generated by ChatGPT Deep Research, and we know there were some errors.

I understand that the inability to find PyCoCu was expected, as it seems the tool list was generated by ChatGPT Deep Research and contains some errors. This is valuable context for our work.

Let me now create a CSV with the metadata about PyCoCu (or rather, the lack thereof) following the format specified in the prompt. I'll make sure to:
1. Follow the writing style guide
2. Format the CSV properly with all required fields
3. Use the title convention "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]"
4. Clearly indicate that this tool does not appear to exist based on the research
5. Present the findings in a scholarly, factual manner

For the CSV, I'll need to include all fields even if they're empty.# PyCoCu: Non-existent Software Tool Investigation for Archaeological Research

Based on my exhaustive investigation, I can confirm that PyCoCu does not appear to exist as an archaeological research software tool. Below is the metadata record documenting this finding and providing relevant information about similar tools that may have caused confusion.

"PyCoCu","After thorough investigation, PyCoCu does not appear to exist as an archaeological or historical research software tool. No evidence was found in academic literature, software repositories, or archaeological computing databases. The name may represent a confusion with similarly named tools such as PyCoTools (biochemical simulation), PyCoCuMa (contact management), or pycocotools (computer vision). The archaeological computing community maintains comprehensive documentation of available tools through repositories like open-archaeo, making the complete absence of PyCoCu significant. Python is widely used in archaeological computing with numerous legitimate tools available for various archaeological applications.","No documented history was found for PyCoCu as an archaeological software tool. Searches across academic databases, repositories, and community forums yielded no references to its development, release history, or version changes. Legitimate archaeological Python tools typically leave extensive documentation trails through publications, conference presentations, and development repositories. For example, PyArchInit (a Python-based archaeological tool for QGIS) has a documented history in academic publications and a maintained GitHub repository. The complete absence of such records for PyCoCu strongly suggests it does not exist as described.","No technical documentation, source code, or implementation details were found for PyCoCu in archaeological contexts. Several similarly named tools exist in other disciplines with well-documented technical implementations: PyCoTools functions as a Python interface to COPASI biochemical simulation software, implementing an object-oriented architecture that interfaces with COPASI's C++ API through Python bindings. It includes modules for model manipulation, visualization, and parameter estimation using pandas DataFrames for data handling. PyCoCuMa implements a client-server architecture using XML-RPC for contact management, with a Python backend and Tkinter frontend, supporting vCard format and integration with standard address book applications. Neither of these tools relates to archaeology, and the complete absence of technical documentation for a purported archaeological tool named PyCoCu indicates it likely does not exist. The archaeological computing community has embraced Python extensively with numerous well-documented implementations for tasks ranging from spatial analysis to artifact classification.","2025-05-30","no","This software does not meet the essential criteria for classification as research software as no evidence exists that it actually exists as a tool. Comprehensive searches across academic literature (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia.edu), software repositories (GitHub, PyPI), archaeological databases (open-archaeo catalog of 548+ archaeological tools), and community forums yielded no references to PyCoCu in archaeological contexts. The archaeological computing community maintains robust documentation practices, making the complete absence of references to this tool across all platforms highly significant. While similarly named tools exist in other disciplines (biochemistry, contact management, computer vision), none have archaeological applications. Given the lack of evidence for PyCoCu's existence, it cannot satisfy any of the essential criteria for research software classification.","","","","","","","hypothetical tool|naming confusion|non-existent software|mistaken identity|software archaeology","","","","Unknown","","","Unknown","Archaeology","Unknown","Unknown","No usage indicators could be found for PyCoCu, as the tool does not appear to exist. Searches across citation databases, software repositories, and community forums yielded no evidence of adoption, implementation, or reference. The archaeological computing community maintains comprehensive documentation of software usage through platforms like open-archaeo and academic publications. The complete absence of PyCoCu from these sources, where even niche tools with limited adoption are typically recorded, strongly indicates the software has no actual usage within the archaeological research community.","","","","","","","The investigation found no specific strengths associated with PyCoCu as it appears not to exist as an archaeological software tool. However, the research revealed that Python-based archaeological tools generally offer several advantages: they leverage Python's extensive scientific computing ecosystem (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib); they typically embrace open-source development practices enabling community contributions; they often provide integration with GIS systems and spatial analysis capabilities; and they generally feature cross-platform compatibility. These characteristics are common among legitimate archaeological Python tools like PyArchInit and others documented in the open-archaeo repository.","As PyCoCu does not appear to exist as an archaeological software tool, it cannot have specific weaknesses. However, the investigation revealed several common challenges faced by Python-based archaeological tools: limited documentation compared to commercial alternatives; fragmented development efforts across different research groups; variable code quality and testing practices; and sustainability challenges when tools are developed by individual researchers rather than institutions. These observations reflect general patterns in archaeological software development rather than specific weaknesses of a non-existent tool.","No survivability assessment can be made for PyCoCu as the tool does not appear to exist. The investigation into its purported existence does highlight factors affecting archaeological software survivability generally: institutional backing significantly improves long-term maintenance prospects; community adoption beyond the original development team enhances sustainability; integration with established platforms (R, QGIS, ArcGIS) increases longevity; and proper documentation and version control practices support knowledge transfer and continued development. These observations apply to legitimate archaeological software rather than to PyCoCu specifically.","For researchers seeking archaeological software capabilities, numerous alternatives exist depending on specific needs: PyArchInit provides a QGIS plugin for archaeological data management and GIS integration; ArcheOS offers a specialized Linux distribution with archaeological tools; various R packages support statistical analysis of archaeological data; and QGIS itself provides extensive spatial analysis capabilities relevant to archaeological research. The open-archaeo repository (https://open-archaeo.info) catalogs 548+ tools and resources for archaeological computing, serving as an excellent reference for identifying appropriate alternatives based on specific research requirements."
```

The research process was thorough and methodical, examining academic databases, software repositories, technical documentation, and archaeological computing communities. The complete absence of PyCoCu from well-maintained archaeological software databases strongly indicates that it does not exist as described. The most likely explanation involves naming confusion with similar-sounding tools from other domains.
