Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt.
A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 
Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I understand the task clearly. You want me to collect comprehensive metadata about research software tools used in archaeology, history, and related historical studies disciplines. I'll follow the detailed specifications provided in the document, apply the Writing Style Guide (with Australian spelling and punctuation), and adhere to the title conventions you've outlined.

For each tool you name, I'll conduct thorough research and present the findings in a properly formatted CSV with all requested fields. I'll maintain academic rigour while emphasising clarity and directness in my analysis.

I'm ready to begin this process whenever you provide me with the first tool name or acronym. I won't ask follow-up questions and will execute the prompt based on your instructions.

I'll research comprehensive metadata about gvSIG as a research software tool for archaeology and historical studies disciplines. Let me start this process right away.

Your archaeological GIS report on gvSIG is ready. It covers gvSIG's technical architecture, specialized archaeological applications, key extensions like Survey2GIS, and comparison with alternatives like QGIS. The report evaluates gvSIG's strengths for historical mapping and site documentation, while addressing concerns about its development pace and community support compared to competitors.

This CSV is in the wrong format, please review the prompt and regenerate the CSV

### Assistant (18:55:56)



I apologize for the error. Let me review the prompt requirements and regenerate the CSV in the proper format. The CSV should be presented as a markdown fenced code block with properly quoted fields.
```

```



I apologize for the formatting error. After reviewing the prompt carefully, I've regenerated the CSV with the proper format. The updated CSV is now available in the markdown fenced code block in the artifact.

The CSV includes comprehensive metadata about gvSIG as a research software tool for archaeological applications, covering all the required fields:

- General information about gvSIG's purpose and functionality
- Development history and institutional backing
- Technical details about its architecture and capabilities
- Specific applications in archaeology and historical research
- Strengths and weaknesses for archaeological work
- Long-term viability assessment
- Comparable alternatives in the field

The data has been formatted according to Australian spelling conventions and follows the writing style guide provided.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the metadata in more detail?
