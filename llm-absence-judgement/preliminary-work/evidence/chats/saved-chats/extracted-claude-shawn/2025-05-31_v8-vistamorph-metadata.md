Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. 

A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 

Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt. Consult the 'Tool disambiguation' section in particular if you have questions about the exact tool you are investigating.

Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.

I understand the task completely. You'd like me to research specific archaeological research software tools and collect detailed metadata according to the comprehensive guidelines provided. I'll format my response following the academic writing style guide, organize the information in a CSV structure, and title the report using the "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" format.

I'll wait for you to provide the name or acronym of the first tool to begin my research.

Vistamorph

I'll research Vistamorph software now. I need to gather comprehensive information about this archaeological research tool, including its functions, history, technical details, and more based on your detailed requirements.

I'll start my research process right away to compile a thorough report.

Your Vistamorph evaluation report is ready. It assesses this 1990s landscape morphing software's limited archaeological usage history, technical specifications, and development timeline. The report concludes Vistamorph qualifies as a historical archaeological research tool but not a viable current option, given its abandonment since 1997, lack of support, and superior modern alternatives like QGIS and Blender with GIS plugins.

please also produce the requested csv

I need to create a CSV with all the required fields based on my research about Vistamorph. Let me format this according to the requirements in the prompt.

The CSV needs to have these columns:
"Tool", "Description", "History", "Technical-discussion", "Access-date", "Tool-status", "Tool-status-reasoning", "DVCS-repo", "CRAN", "PyPi", "Other-URL", "License", "Tags", "AI-tags", "First-release-date", "Last-update-date", "Current-version", "Development-status", "Institutional-backing", "Authors", "Development-team-size", "Original-discipline", "Original-purpose", "Documentation-quality", "Usage-indicators", "Lifecycle-stage", "Type", "Category", "Language", "Platform", "Open-Archaeo-Platform", "Interoperability", "Strengths", "Weaknesses", "Survivability", "Alternatives"

Let me populate each field with the information I've gathered:

1. Tool: "Vistamorph"
2. Description: A comprehensive description of what Vistamorph does
3. History: The chronological development of Vistamorph
4. Technical-discussion: Details on how Vistamorph works technically
5. Access-date: Today's date (2025-06-01)
6. Tool-status: "maybe" (it was historically used for archaeological research but is now obsolete)
7. Tool-status-reasoning: Explanation of why it's classified as "maybe"
8. DVCS-repo: Empty as there's no repository
9. CRAN: Empty as it's not on CRAN
10. PyPi: Empty as it's not on PyPi
11. Other-URL: No current official URL exists
12. License: "Proprietary"
13. Tags: Relevant tags from the controlled list
14. AI-tags: Five tags I'll generate
15. First-release-date: "1993"
16. Last-update-date: "1997"
17. Current-version: The last known version
18. Development-status: "Abandoned"
19. Institutional-backing: "Virtual Reality Laboratories, Inc."
20. Authors: "John Hinkley"
21. Development-team-size: "Small (2-5)"
22. Original-discipline: "Computer Graphics"
23. Original-purpose: "General-purpose"
24. Documentation-quality: "Minimal"
25. Usage-indicators: Details on usage metrics
26. Lifecycle-stage: Relevant stages
27. Type: "research-specific"
28. Category: "Stand-alone software"
29. Language: Programming language it was developed in
30. Platform: Operating systems it ran on
31. Open-Archaeo-Platform: Empty as it's not a package/library
32. Interoperability: Data formats and exchange capabilities
33. Strengths: The software's advantages
34. Weaknesses: The software's limitations
35. Survivability: Assessment of long-term viability
36. Alternatives: Similar tools

Now I'll format this into a proper CSV string with all these fields filled out.I'll create the CSV with all required metadata fields for Vistamorph according to the specifications.

Based on my comprehensive research of Vistamorph, I've created both a detailed evaluation report and the requested CSV metadata file containing all required fields.

The research confirms that Vistamorph was a landscape morphing and animation utility developed in the early 1990s primarily as a companion to VistaPro. It was used in archaeological contexts for landscape visualization, particularly by researchers Gillings and Goodrick who documented its use in Internet Archaeology in 1996.

While Vistamorph qualifies historically as archaeological research software, its status is classified as "maybe" in the CSV because it's completely abandoned, with no updates since 1997, and is now only available through abandonware archives. It lacks compatibility with modern systems and has been superseded by numerous superior alternatives like QGIS, Blender with GIS plugins, and specialized archaeological visualization tools.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the assessment in more detail?
