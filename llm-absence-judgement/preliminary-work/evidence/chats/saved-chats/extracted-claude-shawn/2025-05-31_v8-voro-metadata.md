Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. 

A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 

Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt. Consult the 'Tool disambiguation' section in particular if you have questions about the exact tool you are investigating.

Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.

I understand the task completely. I'll follow the detailed prompt to research and compile metadata about specific software tools used in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. I'll adhere to the Writing Style Guide and Title Conventions provided, presenting my findings in the specified CSV format.

I won't ask follow-up questions and will execute the prompt as directed, consulting the Tool disambiguation section if needed to ensure I'm researching the correct software.

I'm ready to begin research on the first tool as soon as you provide its name or acronym.

I'll research Voro++ thoroughly, focusing on its applications in archaeology and historical studies. This will require some detailed investigation as it's a computational geometry library that may have various applications across disciplines. I'll start my research right away!

Your Voro++ research report is ready. It examines this specialized 3D Voronoi library's technical capabilities, cell-based computational approach, and archaeological applications. While currently underutilized in archaeology, the report highlights promising use cases like the Sabouroff Head analysis, potential integration with LiDAR data, and opportunities for 3D artifact distribution analysis. The analysis includes performance comparisons with alternatives like CGAL and Qhull, development history, and recommendations for increasing archaeological adoption.

I need to create a properly formatted CSV with all the metadata about Voro++ according to the specifications in the prompt. This needs to include a single row with all the requested fields in the specified order.

Let me organize the information I've gathered about Voro++ and format it according to the CSV structure requested:

1. Tool: "Voro++"
2. Description: A concise overview focusing on what it does
3. History: Chronological development account
4. Technical-discussion: Technical implementation details
5. Access-date: Today's date (2025-06-01)
6. Tool-status: "yes" (it meets the criteria for research software)
7. Tool-status-reasoning: Explanation of why it qualifies as research software
8. Repository URLs (DVCS-repo, CRAN, PyPi)
9. Other-URL: Main website URL
10. License: BSD-3-Clause-LBNL
11. Tags: Relevant tags from the controlled list
12. AI-tags: Five descriptive tags I'll generate
13. Release dates (first and last)
14. Current-version: 0.4.6
15. Development-status: "Maintenance-only" or "Active" depending on assessment
16. Institutional-backing: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
17. Authors: Chris Rycroft and others
18. Development-team-size: Appropriate category
19. Original-discipline: Physics/Materials Science
20. Original-purpose: "General-purpose" for computational research
21. Documentation-quality: Assessment of documentation
22. Usage-indicators: Metrics on usage
23. Lifecycle-stage: Research stages it supports
24. Type: "research-specific"
25. Category: "Packages and libraries"
26. Language: C++
27. Platform: Supported platforms
28. Open-Archaeo-Platform: (leave empty as it's not a package for a specific platform)
29. Interoperability: Data formats and exchange capabilities
30. Strengths: Key advantages
31. Weaknesses: Limitations
32. Survivability: Assessment of long-term viability
33. Alternatives: Similar tools

Let me now compile all this information into a properly formatted CSV:I'll now create the CSV with the metadata for Voro++ according to the specified format:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



The CSV with all the metadata for Voro++ has been created. It contains comprehensive information about this 3D Voronoi cell library, including:

1. Core functionality and purpose
2. Development history and current status
3. Technical implementation details
4. Archaeological applications and potential
5. Strengths, weaknesses, and alternatives

The metadata follows the specified format with all required fields populated, including proper classification of Voro++ as research software with appropriate reasoning. I've particularly highlighted both the current archaeological applications (like the Sabouroff Head analysis) and untapped potential uses in areas like 3D artifact distribution analysis and integration with LiDAR data.

Is there any specific aspect of the Voro++ metadata you'd like me to elaborate on further?
