## Conversation

### Human (13:34:08)

Hi Claude, could you help me develop a compelling and detailed definition of a 'research software tool'? Draw on the conversations and project knowledge associated with this project, as well as your own information.

### Assistant (13:34:28)

 I'd be happy to develop a comprehensive definition of a 'research software tool' based on the document you've shared and my knowledge of research software.

# Defining Research Software Tools

A research software tool is specialized software that enables, enhances, or accelerates the scientific research process by supporting one or more stages of scientific inquiry, from hypothesis generation to data collection, analysis, visualization, and publication of results.

## Core Characteristics

Based on the Hettrick report and broader understanding of the research software ecosystem, I would define research software tools by these essential characteristics:

1. **Research-Oriented Purpose**: Developed specifically to "generate, process and analyze results" in a research context, as noted in the report's definition section (3.1).

2. **Functional Spectrum**: Ranges from "highly developed packages with significant user bases to short (tens of lines of code) programs written by researchers for their own use."

3. **Knowledge Embodiment**: Represents encoded scientific knowledge and methodological approaches that enable specific kinds of research inquiries.

4. **Lifecycle Variability**: May exist at different development stages - from early prototype code developed by a single researcher to mature software maintained by dedicated teams and used across multiple disciplines.

5. **Value Chain Position**: Serves as critical infrastructure that sits between raw data and research insights, making it a fundamental but often invisible contributor to scientific discovery.

## Distinguishing Features

What separates research software tools from general software:

1. **Specialized Functionality**: Addresses specific scientific needs rather than general computing tasks.

2. **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Embeds disciplinary expertise and methodological approaches within its functionality.

3. **Evolving Requirements**: Often develops organically alongside research processes, with features added as research questions evolve.

4. **Reproducibility Role**: Directly impacts the reproducibility and reliability of research results, creating a direct link between software quality and research integrity.

5. **Development Context**: Often created in academic environments under different constraints and incentives than commercial software.

## Categories and Examples

Research software tools typically fall into these categories:

1. **Data Collection Tools**: Software for gathering, recording, or generating research data
   - Laboratory instrument control systems
   - Survey platforms
   - Simulation frameworks

2. **Analysis Tools**: Software that processes, transforms, or derives insights from research data
   - Statistical analysis packages
   - Computational modeling environments
   - Machine learning frameworks customized for research applications

3. **Visualization Tools**: Software for representing data or results visually
   - Scientific plotting libraries
   - Interactive data exploration environments
   - Specialized visualization software for particular data types

4. **Research Infrastructure Tools**: Software that supports the research process itself
   - Electronic lab notebooks
   - Research data management systems
   - Workflow management systems

## Sustainability Considerations

The definition of research software tools must acknowledge their sustainability challenges:

1. **Sustainability Requirements**: Requires ongoing effort to maintain functionality in changing computing environments, as the report notes that "a constant level of effort is required to maintain the software's operation."

2. **Dependency Management**: Exists within a complex "pyramid or stack" of dependencies that creates sustainability challenges as underlying software changes.

3. **Resource Constraints**: Often developed with limited resources and without explicit sustainability planning.

4. **Preservation Challenges**: Presents unique preservation difficulties compared to data, as software "must evolve and adapt to the constant changes in its environment" rather than remaining static.

This definition emphasizes that research software tools are not merely technical artifacts but essential components of the research infrastructure that embody scientific knowledge, enable discovery, and deserve recognition and investment proportional to their critical role in advancing research.

That is a very good detailed definition, can you also give me a short, three-sentence definition I could use in an academic paper?

 # Research Software Tool Definition

Research software tools are specialized digital instruments developed to generate, process, and analyze results throughout the scientific research lifecycle, ranging from sophisticated packages with broad user bases to targeted scripts created by individual researchers. These tools embody encoded scientific knowledge and methodological approaches that transform raw data into research insights, making them fundamental yet often underrecognized contributors to scientific discovery. Unlike general-purpose software, research software tools integrate domain expertise, directly impact research reproducibility, and require ongoing maintenance to adapt to changing computational environments and evolving research questions.

### Human (13:56:16)

Could you please reproduce both the long and short definitions as a single document in LaTeX, using Australian English spelling and punctuation? Do not change the content otherwise.

I've created a LaTeX document containing both the concise and comprehensive definitions of "research software tools" using Australian English spelling and punctuation. The document is formatted with proper LaTeX structure, including sections and subsections for easy navigation.

The content includes:
- A three-sentence concise definition suitable for an academic paper
- The comprehensive definition with all the details from my earlier response
- Proper formatting with bullet points and emphasis on key terms

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the document?
