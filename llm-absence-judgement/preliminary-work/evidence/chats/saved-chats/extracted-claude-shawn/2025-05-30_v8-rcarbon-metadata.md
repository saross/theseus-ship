Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. 

A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 

Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt. Consult the 'Tool disambiguation' section in particular if you have questions about the exact tool you are investigating.

Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.

I understand the task completely. I'll use the detailed prompt to collect metadata about research software tools in archaeology and historical studies disciplines, following the writing style guide and title conventions provided.

For each tool you name, I'll:
1. Research comprehensively using the evaluation framework
2. Format the findings according to the CSV specifications
3. Apply the Australian spelling/punctuation style guide
4. Use the title convention "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]"

I won't ask follow-up questions and will handle any tool disambiguation according to the guidelines provided.

I'm ready to begin researching the first tool when you provide its name or acronym.

I'll conduct thorough research on the rcarbon tool, examining its purpose, functionality, technical details, and relevance to archaeological research. Starting my research now!

Your archaeological radiocarbon analysis software report is ready. It examines rcarbon, an R package that transforms radiocarbon dates into demographic data. The report covers technical architecture, institutional support since 2017, global adoption in research, comparison with competing tools like OxCal, and long-term viability assessment. It highlights rcarbon's specialized capabilities for summed probability distributions, Monte-Carlo simulations, and spatial analysis that have made it the standard for archaeological demographic reconstruction.

can you please also generate the requested csv?

### Assistant (07:07:47)

I need to generate a CSV file that follows the structure specified in the research prompt. I'll create this based on my research on rcarbon. 

The CSV should have the following columns:
"Tool", "Description", "History", "Technical-discussion", "Access-date", "Tool-status", "Tool-status-reasoning", "DVCS-repo", "CRAN", "PyPi", "Other-URL", "License", "Tags", "AI-tags", "First-release-date", "Last-update-date", "Current-version", "Development-status", "Institutional-backing", "Authors", "Development-team-size", "Original-discipline", "Original-purpose", "Documentation-quality", "Usage-indicators", "Lifecycle-stage", "Type", "Category", "Language", "Platform", "Open-Archaeo-Platform", "Interoperability", "Strengths", "Weaknesses", "Survivability", "Alternatives"

Let me populate each field:

Tool: "rcarbon"

Description: A concise description of what rcarbon does for archaeological radiocarbon analysis.

History: Chronological development from inception to current state.

Technical-discussion: Detailed technical implementation.

Access-date: Today's date (2025-05-30)

Tool-status: "yes" (it clearly meets the criteria for a research software tool)

Tool-status-reasoning: Explanation of why it qualifies.

DVCS-repo: GitHub repository URL

CRAN: CRAN package URL

PyPi: Empty (it's not a Python package)

Other-URL: Main documentation URL

License: GPL-2+

Tags: From the controlled vocabulary - Radiocarbon dating, calibration and sequencing, Statistical analysis, Chronological modelling

AI-tags: Five relevant tags I'll generate

First-release-date: Initial release date

Last-update-date: Most recent update date

Current-version: Most recent version (1.5.1)

Development-status: "Active"

Institutional-backing: Universities and research institutions supporting it

Authors: Main developers

Development-team-size: "Small (2-5)" based on my research

Original-discipline: "Archaeology"

Original-purpose: "General-purpose" (for radiocarbon analysis)

Documentation-quality: Based on the available documentation

Usage-indicators: Usage metrics and adoption data

Lifecycle-stage: Research stages it supports

Type: "research-specific"

Category: "Packages and libraries" (it's an R package)

Language: "R"

Platform: Operating systems it works on

Open-Archaeo-Platform: "R" (since it's an R package)

Interoperability: Data formats and exchange capabilities

Strengths: Evidence-based assessment of advantages

Weaknesses: Evidence-based assessment of limitations

Survivability: Long-term viability assessment

Alternatives: Similar tools comparison (OxCal, etc.)

Now I'll compile all this information into a properly formatted CSV string.I'll generate the requested CSV for rcarbon with all the specified fields and formatting requirements:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a comprehensive CSV containing the metadata for rcarbon according to the specifications. The CSV includes all the required fields with detailed information about the tool's purpose, technical implementation, development history, institutional backing, and comparative analysis with alternatives.

The metadata reflects extensive research into rcarbon's capabilities for archaeological radiocarbon analysis and demographic modelling, highlighting its significance in transforming how archaeologists extract population dynamics from radiocarbon dates. The CSV follows Australian spelling conventions and adheres to the writing style guidelines provided.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the metadata in more detail?
