Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt.
A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 
Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I understand your request. We'll be collecting evidence for a research paper about research software tools in archaeology, history, and other historical disciplines. I'll follow your writing style guide and title conventions when creating reports about specific software tools.

Based on the "Research Software Sustainability" document you've shared, I can see this is an important area of focus. Software sustainability involves practices that allow research software to continue functioning as expected in the future, which is vital for reproducibility and reliability of research results.

I'm ready to begin researching specific software tools once you provide me with the name or acronym of the first tool. I'll compile metadata about each tool and present it consistently following your style guidelines.

### Assistant (09:29:13)



I'll help you research metadata about Gephi for your research paper on software tools in archaeology and historical studies. Your request is clear, so I'll begin the research process right away to gather comprehensive information about this tool.
```
This block is not supported on your current device yet.
```

Your Gephi software assessment is ready. It covers this open-source network visualization tool's development history, technical specifications, and specific applications in archaeology and historical studies. The report examines data formats, visualization capabilities, strengths and limitations for historical research, and includes methodological considerations for effectively analyzing historical networks.

Can you please also generate the requested CSV?

---

### Assistant (13:22:34)



I'll create a CSV file with the metadata about Gephi based on the research conducted. Here's a structured CSV that follows your writing style guidelines:
```

```



I've created a CSV file with comprehensive metadata about Gephi based on our research. The CSV includes key information such as:

- Basic identification (name, version, URL)
- Development history and current status
- Technical specifications
- Research applications in archaeology and historical studies
- Data formats and visualization capabilities
- Strengths and limitations for historical research

The metadata is structured in a clear, consistent format following your writing style guidelines. You can download the CSV for use in your research paper about research software tools in archaeology and historical studies.

Would you like me to research another software tool next, or would you prefer to discuss any specific aspects of Gephi in more detail?

Please check the format and contents of the CSV against the requirements of the prompt and regenerate it

### Assistant (13:23:47)



You're right - I should revise the CSV to better match the prompt requirements. After reviewing both the content and format, I'll create an improved version that adheres more closely to the writing style guide and presents the information in a more structured way.
```

I've updated the CSV file to better match the requirements of the prompt and to adhere more closely to the writing style guide. The revised version:

1. Uses more precise Australian English spelling (e.g., "visualisation" instead of "visualization")
2. Employs consistent field naming with underscores for multi-word fields
3. Provides more detailed information specific to archaeological and historical applications
4. Includes methodological considerations for historical research
5. Adds relevant URLs for documentation and repository access
6. Structures the information more logically, flowing from basic details to technical aspects to applications
7. Uses more precise technical terminology with brief explanations where needed

The CSV now presents a comprehensive overview of Gephi as a network analysis tool for archaeological and historical research, with attention to both technical specifications and scholarly applications.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to adjust further in the CSV file?
