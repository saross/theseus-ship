Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt.
A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 
Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I understand your requirements for collecting metadata about research software tools used in archaeology, history, and related historical studies disciplines. I'll follow the detailed prompt instructions, including the writing style guide with its emphasis on academic clarity, direct assertions with appropriate nuance, and balanced authority.

For the CSV output, I'll ensure proper formatting with the specified columns and make sure all field values are properly escaped with no newlines within fields. Multiple values will use pipe (|) separators, and I'll use single quotes for any quoted text within fields.

When you provide the name or acronym of the first tool, I'll research it comprehensively, following the methodical approach outlined, and present my findings in the requested format.

I'll start researching HTMLfig as a research software tool for archaeology and historical studies. This tool's name is somewhat ambiguous, so let me gather comprehensive information about it through advanced research.

Your archaeological visualization technology report is ready. It examines "HTMLfig" technologies: the Python mpld3.fig_to_html() function and HTML figure elements used in archaeological visualization. The report covers technical implementation, development history, archaeological applications, usage metrics, alternative tools, and strengths/limitations for research. It explains how these web technologies enable interactive visualization of archaeological data for both scholarly communication and public engagement.

Please review the prompt, your CSV is in the wrong format. Please regenerate it to spec.

### Assistant (19:53:36)



I apologize for the formatting error. You're right - the CSV format in the prompt requires a specific structure with proper escaping and formatting. I'll regenerate it correctly now.
