Hi Claude, can you give me a brief definition of an 'agentic system' in the context of LLMs?

 # Agentic Systems in the Context of LLMs

An agentic system is an artificial intelligence setup where language models (like Claude or GPT) can take more autonomous, goal-directed actions rather than simply responding to prompts. 

In traditional LLM interactions, the model responds to a query and waits for the next human input. In contrast, an agentic system can:

1. Set and pursue goals independently
2. Plan a sequence of actions to achieve those goals
3. Execute actions in the external world (through API calls, tool use, etc.)
4. Observe the results of its actions
5. Adjust its approach based on feedback and observations

Think of it like the difference between a helpful librarian who can only answer your questions (traditional LLM) versus a research assistant who can decide what information you need, search for it, organize it, and even take actions based on it without constant supervision (agentic system).

A key characteristic of agentic LLM systems is their ability to break complex tasks into manageable steps and use external tools to accomplish them. For example, an agentic system might analyze a dataset by deciding to first clean the data, then visualize it using appropriate charts, and finally generate insights—all without explicit human instructions for each step.

This represents an evolution in AI capabilities—moving from systems that primarily respond to human queries toward systems that can operate with greater autonomy while still aligning with human intentions and values.
