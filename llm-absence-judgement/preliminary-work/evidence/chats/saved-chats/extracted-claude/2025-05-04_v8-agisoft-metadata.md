Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
Note that a 'Writing Style Guide' is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV.

I understand the task completely. This is a thorough research project to collect detailed metadata about research software tools used in archaeology, history, and related disciplines. I'll follow the comprehensive research methodology outlined in the prompt, applying the Writing Style Guide to ensure high-quality output.

The process involves:
1. Conducting exhaustive research on each tool you name
2. Collecting metadata according to the specified fields
3. Evaluating each tool against the research software criteria
4. Presenting findings in a properly formatted CSV with all required fields
5. Following the Writing Style Guide for clarity, directness, and appropriate technical depth

When you provide the name or acronym of the first tool, I'll begin the research process using the launch_extended_search_task tool to gather comprehensive information. I'll ensure all claims are evidence-based, properly cited, and reflect the most current version of the software.

Please provide the name of the first research software tool you'd like me to investigate.

Here's the completed metadata for Agisoft PhotoScan/Metashape formatted as requested. The CSV contains comprehensive information about this photogrammetry software that has become a fundamental tool in archaeological research.

The metadata covers all required fields including:
- Detailed description of functionality and archaeological applications
- Complete development history from PhotoScan (2010) to current Metashape (2.2.1)
- Technical implementation details and processing pipeline
- Licensing and institutional information
- Strengths and weaknesses specific to archaeological applications
- Long-term viability assessment
- Compatible formats and interoperability
- Alternative software options

I've structured the information following your Writing Style Guide, focusing on clarity, directness, and appropriate technical depth. I've maintained academic rigor while using active voice and direct assertions, and provided concrete details about both technical aspects and archaeological applications.

Is there any specific aspect of the metadata you'd like me to explain in more detail?
