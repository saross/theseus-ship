Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
A 'Writing Style Guide' is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 
I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt.
## Title **Format & Structure**: For the title (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" pattern for the name and title of your Report

I understand completely. I'll follow the detailed instructions provided to assemble metadata about research software tools in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. I'll apply the Writing Style Guide to both the report and CSV output, and use the specified title format.

Rather than asking follow-up questions, I'll proceed with researching whichever tool name or acronym you provide next. I'll ensure thoroughness and accuracy in my research, following the evaluation framework and controlled vocabulary as specified.

Please provide the name or acronym of the first tool you'd like me to research.

The name "Bwigg" appears to be fairly specific, which suggests it could be a specialized research software tool. I'll launch some comprehensive research to gather detailed metadata about Bwigg following the guidelines you've provided.

Your archaeological software search results are ready. After thorough investigation, we found no evidence that "Bwigg" exists as an archaeological research software tool across academic databases, software repositories, and digital archaeology resources. The report includes our comprehensive search methodology, possible explanations for this absence, and alternatives like QGIS, R with archdata, PAST, ArcGIS Pro, and other established archaeological tools.
