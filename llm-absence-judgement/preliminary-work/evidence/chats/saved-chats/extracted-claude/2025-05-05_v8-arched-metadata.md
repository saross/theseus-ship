Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
A 'Writing Style Guide' is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 
I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt.

I understand completely. I'll be collecting detailed metadata about research software tools used in archaeology, history, and related historical studies disciplines following the comprehensive framework provided. I'll apply the writing style guide to ensure consistency in my reporting.

I'll wait for you to provide the name or acronym of the first tool to begin my research and metadata collection.

Thank you for providing the tool name. I'll research ArchEd thoroughly following the metadata collection framework and apply the Australian English writing style guide.

I'll launch a comprehensive research process on ArchEd to gather all the required metadata.

Your ArchEd software analysis is ready. It covers the development history, technical capabilities, and current status of this archaeological Harris matrix visualization tool. The report examines its strengths and limitations, availability issues, usage in archaeological research, and evaluates it against alternatives like Harris Matrix Composer. The assessment highlights ArchEd's effective functionality but notes its abandoned development state and limited interface.
