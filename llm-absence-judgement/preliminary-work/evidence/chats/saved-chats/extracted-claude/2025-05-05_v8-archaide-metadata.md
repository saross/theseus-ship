"ArchAIDE","ArchAIDE (Archaeological Automatic Interpretation and Documentation of cEramics) is specialised software that uses artificial intelligence to accelerate the identification of pottery fragments in archaeological research. The current version employs a dual recognition system combining shape-based analysis (via modified PointNet architecture achieving 62.8% accuracy) with appearance-based analysis (using ResNet-50 neural networks reaching 83.8% top-5 accuracy). Users photograph pottery fragments with mobile devices, which then processes images through neural networks to identify matches from a reference database containing Roman amphorae, Terra Sigillata varieties, and Majolica of Montelupo. The system preserves the archaeologist's expertise in the final identification decision while dramatically reducing classification time by 50-66% compared to traditional manual methods.","ArchAIDE evolved from initial concept development between 2014-2016 at the University of Pisa by archaeologists Gabriele Gattiglia and Francesca Anichini. The project officially launched in June 2016 with €2.46 million in EU Horizon 2020 funding (grant №693548). Development progressed through defined phases: knowledge base and machine learning algorithm creation (2016-2017), beta testing with field implementations (2018), and mobile and desktop application release (early 2019). The project formally concluded in May 2019 with the 'Archaeorevolution is now' conference, followed by a final EU Commission review meeting in Brussels in July 2019. Since project completion, limited ongoing maintenance has continued through MAPPA Lab at the University of Pisa. The project received the 'best App of the year' award at Heritage in Motion Awards in 2019, recognising its innovative approach to archaeological documentation.","The current ArchAIDE implementation employs a distributed client-server architecture with several interconnected components. The system's core is built primarily in Python, utilising TensorFlow v1.x for machine learning functionality. The recognition engine employs dual approaches: shape-based recognition using a modified PointNet architecture that processes 3D pottery profiles with 62.8% accuracy, and appearance-based recognition implementing ResNet-50 for pattern and decoration analysis achieving 83.8% top-5 accuracy. The client side consists of native iOS and Android mobile applications plus a web-based desktop interface, while server components include an API server, reference database, and separate model servers for shape and decoration recognition. Communication occurs via RESTful architecture with OAuth2 authentication. The development team addressed data scarcity challenges innovatively by digitising paper catalogues, conducting extensive photo campaigns of authentic materials, and generating synthetic training data from 3D models. This last approach proved particularly valuable, allowing creation of millions of virtual fragments from limited authentic material. The workflow mirrors traditional archaeological practice: documentation, profile tracing (for shape-based identification), automatic recognition, result presentation, verification, and data storage – designed to function with limited connectivity typical in field scenarios. A significant limitation is the current version's dependency on older frameworks, with documentation explicitly noting incompatibility with 'TensorFlow v2 or Python versions newer than 3.6.X' as of 2021. The system's code is distributed across multiple GitHub repositories, with machine learning components in barak-itkin/archaide-software and digitisation tools in cnr-isti-vclab/ArchAIDE_digit (under Mozilla Public License 2.0).","2025-05-05","yes","ArchAIDE qualifies as research software as it meets all essential criteria by supporting archaeological research activities through meaningful transformation of pottery fragment data using recognised methodologies. It also satisfies multiple supporting criteria by incorporating domain knowledge (pottery classification taxonomy), supporting research lifecycle stages (analysis and interpretation), performing data transformation (converting images to classifications), providing analytical capabilities (shape and decoration recognition algorithms), and offering visualisation functions (presenting results with confidence levels). The software is specifically designed for archaeological research applications, with documentation and interface tailored to archaeological workflows.","https://github.com/barak-itkin/archaide-software","","","http://www.archaide.eu/","Varies (Mozilla Public License 2.0 for digitisation tools, unclear for main components)","Ceramic analysis|Shape recognition|Artefact morphology|Data management|Machine learning","archaeological-recognition|pottery-identification|neural-networks|mobile-archaeology|field-research-tool","2016-06","2019-05","Unknown","Maintenance-only","University of Pisa (MAPPA Lab coordinator)|CNR-ISTI Visual Computing Lab (Italy)|Tel Aviv University School of Computer Science (Israel)|University of Barcelona (Spain)|University of Cologne (Germany)|University of York Archaeology Data Service (UK)|Baraka Arqueólogos S.L.

The mobile applications are available on both iOS App Store and Google Play Store, though specific download statistics are not publicly available. The primary academic paper 'Developing the ArchAIDE Application' (Anichini et al., 2020) has been cited in multiple archaeological publications. The project received the 'best App of the year' award at Heritage in Motion Awards, indicating recognition from the heritage sector. Field testing was conducted at various European archaeological sites during the project period, with particular success reported for Roman amphorae classification. Project coordinator Gabriele Gattiglia noted that using the system could save 'half to two thirds of the time currently spent on pottery classification'.","Analysis|Interpretation","research-specific","Stand-alone software","Python|JavaScript","Android|iOS|Web","","ArchAIDE supports import/export of data in common archaeological documentation formats and interfaces with specialised archaeological databases. The current version can process standard image formats (JPEG, PNG) from device cameras or galleries. The system architecture allows for both online operation with full database access and offline functionality with cached reference data for field use where connectivity is limited. Results can be exported in formats compatible with common archaeological recording systems and institutional databases. Because the application's main purpose is identification rather than data management, it serves primarily as an input to larger documentation ecosystems rather than a comprehensive interoperability hub.","ArchAIDE's dual recognition approaches combine shape and decoration analysis for comprehensive identification, offering significantly greater accuracy than either method alone. The mobile-first design enables practical field use on standard smartphones and tablets, directly addressing archaeologists' needs in excavation contexts. The system integrates domain knowledge by linking fragments to comprehensive pottery type information including chronology, production centres, and distribution patterns. The application preserves archaeologist authority in decision-making by presenting potential matches with confidence levels rather than forcing automated conclusions. The underlying neural networks demonstrate remarkable performance despite the highly variable nature of archaeological materials, with decoration recognition achieving 83.8% top-5 accuracy. The system's innovative approach to generating training data using synthetic fragments from 3D models represents a methodological breakthrough for archaeological computing with broader applications. The project's transparent approach to publishing results and reference data through the Archaeology Data Service ensures long-term availability of the underlying research.","ArchAIDE's current pottery class coverage remains limited to specific types (Roman amphorae, Terra Sigillata, Majolica of Montelupo), restricting its comprehensive application across all archaeological contexts. Recognition accuracy, while impressive, still requires expert verification, particularly for shape-based recognition which achieves 62.8% accuracy compared to decoration-based methods. The system faces significant technical dependencies on older software frameworks, with explicit documentation noting incompatibility with 'TensorFlow v2 or Python versions newer than 3.6.X' as of 2021. This creates substantial maintenance challenges as computing environments evolve. Network dependency limits functionality in remote field locations with poor connectivity, though some offline capabilities exist. The training data requirements necessitated extensive collection efforts, and expanding the system to new pottery classes would require similar significant investment. Licensing information for core components appears incomplete, creating potential barriers to community adoption and extension. The user interface, while functional, occasionally prioritises technical capabilities over user experience, particularly in complex identification scenarios.","ArchAIDE faces several challenges to its long-term viability. The formal EU-funded project ended in May 2019, and evidence of active development since then is minimal. The system's reliance on older frameworks (TensorFlow v1.x, Python 3.6.x) creates growing compatibility issues as computing environments evolve. Current pottery type coverage represents only a fraction of archaeological ceramics, requiring substantial investment to expand. These technical debts limit the software's potential longevity without renewed development effort. Supporting factors include continued institutional backing from the MAPPA Lab at University of Pisa, public availability of core methodologies and data, and clear demonstrated value through significant time savings in pottery classification. Without secured ongoing funding or a strong open-source community developing around the codebase, the most enduring impact will likely be methodological – demonstrating effective approaches for applying AI to archaeological classification problems that future systems can build upon. The software remains available and functional, but its technical foundations will increasingly limit compatibility with modern computing environments.","The primary direct competitor to ArchAIDE is Arch-I-Scan from the University of Leicester, which similarly uses CNN-based approaches for Roman pottery identification but differs in emphasising complete vessel knowledge before fragment analysis. Complementary technologies include structure from motion scanning approaches by researchers like Kampel and Karasik, the CERAMALEX Database focused on pottery cataloguing from German and French excavations, and Pottery from Motion for 3D documentation. ArchAIDE's comparative advantages include its mobile-first approach, dual recognition methods combining shape and decoration analysis, knowledge integration connecting fragments to comprehensive type information, and archaeologist-friendly interface designed for field use. Its disadvantages against specialised systems include limited ongoing development, ceramic class coverage restricted to specific types, and potential accuracy trade-offs versus highly targeted systems. The most significant differentiator is ArchAIDE's focus on practical field application through mobile devices rather than laboratory-based analysis."
