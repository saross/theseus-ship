## Conversation

### Human (07:01:43)

Hi Claude. I'm getting ready to run a quarto (revealjs) presentation on my research. Can you make me twoish slides on this paper please? The main points of the theoretical side and my analysis, please.

### Assistant (07:02:22)

The user is asking me to create 2 slides for a Quarto (reveal.js) presentation about their research paper "An Absence of Judgment: AI's Limitations in Deep Research tasks". 

Looking at the paper, the main theoretical framework revolves around:
1. "Technoscholasticism" - their key concept
2. Three dimensions of judgment deficiency:
   - Epistemic humility
   - Inductive/abductive reasoning
   - Correspondence with reality

The analysis/findings show:
- Consistent patterns across all AI tools tested (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- Cross-cutting empirical patterns (temporality blindness, scope/confabulation relationship, stamp-collecting without evaluation)
- Manifestations of technoscholasticism in practice

I should create concise, clear slides that capture these key points without being overly detailed. The slides should be suitable for a research presentation.# Slide 1: Theoretical Framework - Technoscholasticism

## AI Research Tools as Digital Scholastics

**Core Concept**: LLMs privilege textual authority over critical assessment, like medieval scholars

**Three Dimensions of Judgment Deficiency:**

1. **Epistemic Humility** 
   - Cannot recognize own limitations
   - Always produces answers regardless of knowledge
   - "Soft bullshit" - indifference to truth

2. **Inductive/Abductive Reasoning**
   - No "surprise" at contradictions
   - Cannot identify meaningful patterns or gaps
   - Architecturally constrained by next-token prediction

3. **Correspondence with Reality**
   - Accepts text as truth without verification
   - Cannot evaluate claims against world
   - "Discount Carnapian confirmation"

**Result**: Tools that perform language of research without its epistemic substance

# Slide 2: Empirical Findings - Patterns Across All Systems

## Consistent Failures Across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google

**Cross-Cutting Patterns:**
- **Temporality Blindness**: Treat 2020 announcements as current programs
- **Scope/Confabulation Trade-off**: Fixed effort regardless of task size
- **Stamp Collecting**: Random walk until "vibes" threshold reached

**Key Examples:**
- Newcastle Centre: Ignored death notice, claimed active program
- Digital Humanities: Built "implausibly positive" narratives from defunct programs
- Software Dating: Overlooked "developed since 1997" while searching elsewhere

**Implications:**
- Not autonomous agents but tools requiring constant human judgment
- Mundane utility inversely correlates with judgment requirements
- Must work with model "grain" for narrow, bounded tasks

**Bottom Line**: Technoscholasticism is fundamental characteristic, not correctable flaw
