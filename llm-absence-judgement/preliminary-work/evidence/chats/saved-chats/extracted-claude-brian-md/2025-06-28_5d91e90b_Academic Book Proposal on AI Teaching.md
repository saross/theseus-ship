## Conversation

### Human (12:25:54)

Hi Claude.

Here is an email I am proposing to write to a Routledge editor.

Dear Gerald,
I am writing to enquire about the potential of publishing an edited volume as a "Focus" on the topic of "Teaching with and about AI". My intention with this volume is to serve as a starting point about the pragmatics of AI — from a humanities perspective. A number of complete chapters, extended abstracts, and *crucially*, case studies from my students are available at https://zenodo.org/communities/iacap-aisb-25-teachingai/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest. (https://zenodo.org/records/15741641 has a short summary of each contribution we currently have) 
I estimate each chapter to be around 8000 words, give or take, and my contributions have been typeset in LaTeX already. The case studies are around 3000 words each. Of note, there is also a corpus of data published under mediated access with the Australian Data Archive that contains class transcripts, assessments, and researcher observation of my classes. Many of the works in this volume stem from that experience. Complimenting the Australian perspective, I also have a completed chapter from a researcher in the states (https://zenodo.org/records/15644957) and a planned chapter from a philosopher in Korea.  
We hope to contribute evidence-based pedagogy, philosophy, and ethnographic observations of how students have changed their thinking about the mundane utility and use of AI over the course of a semester. We were pointed at your name by our colleague, Govand Azeez, but looking at the list of editors, we are more than happy to be passed along to any of your colleagues who may also be interested in this topic. 
My recent publications in the pragmatics of AI, outside of the preprints prepared for this volume include:
* https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1360080X.2025.2509187
* https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44204-025-00247-1

As an aside, with a different colleague, I have a 14,000 word paper that is proving somewhat difficult to cut down, coining the term "technoscholasticism" around how current "Deep Research" modes in AI display a fundamental absence of judgement. This is a more philosophical work intended to compliment some research into the software lifecycle of archaeological software tools that has somewhat taken on a life of its own. (https://iacapconf.org/pages/schedule.html#symp-2-2-an-absence-of-judgment-ais-limitations-in-deep-research-tasks is the extended abstract for that paper.  As this is a response to recent innovations in "agentic" (it's not) LLM claims, it seems timely and of possible interest to yourself or other colleagues *outside* the scope of our main proposal above.
I am currently at a series of conferences and research residencies across Europe until 1 October, but I would be delighted to correspond with you or your colleagues if you find any aspect of the communication above interesting.
Sincerely,
-Brian Ballsun-Stanton

And attached are some of their FAQs

Please ask me one specific question at a time until you believe you are able to suggest revisions to my letter.

### Assistant (12:26:10)

The user has written a draft email to a Routledge editor about publishing an edited volume as a "Focus" publication on "Teaching with and about AI". They've also attached some Routledge FAQs about proposals and publishing guidelines.

Looking at the attached documents, I can see important information about:
1. What Routledge looks for in authors and proposals
2. The different types of books they publish (including Focus short form books)
3. The proposal submission process

The user wants me to ask one specific question at a time to help improve their letter. Let me think about what questions would be most helpful based on the guidelines and the draft.

Key things I notice from the guidelines:
- Focus books are 20,000-50,000 words total (not per chapter)
- They're meant for quick turnaround on timely topics
- Minimal illustrations/equations
- The proposal should include specific elements like competing titles, audience, etc.

Issues I see with the current draft:
1. The word count seems off - they mention 8,000 words per chapter which would be more appropriate for a Handbook, not a Focus book
2. They haven't clearly stated why this is timely/urgent for the Focus format
3. The aside about the technoscholasticism paper seems like it might confuse the main proposal
4. They haven't addressed key proposal elements like market, competing titles, etc.

Let me start with the most fundamental question about their understanding of the Focus format.Looking at your draft and the Routledge guidelines, I notice you mention chapters of around 8,000 words each. However, according to the Focus guidelines in the attached documents, Focus books contain between 20,000 and 50,000 words total (including notes and references), not per chapter.

Given this constraint, are you envisioning this as a Focus book with much shorter chapters, or would you prefer to propose it as a different type of publication like a Handbook or standard edited collection?

---

### Human (12:26:39)

Right now, I think we can fit within a focus without too much trouble.

---

### Assistant (12:26:47)

The user has confirmed they think they can fit within the Focus format (20,000-50,000 words total). This means their current estimate of 8,000 words per chapter is way too high if they have multiple chapters. They'll need to significantly reduce the chapter lengths.

Let me ask about their vision for the structure of the book to better understand how they plan to fit within these constraints.Given the Focus format's 20,000-50,000 word limit, how many chapters are you planning to include? 

For example, if you're aiming for the upper limit of 50,000 words total, you could have perhaps 5-6 chapters at around 8,000 words each (leaving room for introduction and other matter), but that would require being selective about which contributions to include.

---

### Human (12:27:18)

is the symposium booklet

---

### Assistant (12:27:37)

The user has provided a symposium booklet that lists the chapters and case studies for their proposed volume. Let me count what they have:

Chapters:
1. The Emperor's New Clothes: A Manifesto for Universities in an AI-Haunted World (Ballsun-Stanton & Khalid)
2. Towards an Evidence Based Framework for AI in Philosophy Education (Max Parks)
3. Teaching the Unknown: A Pedagogical Framework for Teaching With and About AI (Ballsun-Stanton & Torrington)
4. Ethnographic insights into AI Pedagogy for Higher Education: A Qualitative Study (Francesca Martinelli)

Case Studies:
1. AI's Applicability to the Legal Profession (Lianne Grace Mabborang Tacardon)
2. The Art of the Prompt: Lessons in Play, Bias, and Digital Creation (Lilli Langton)
3. Grappling with uncertainty in AI use (Marina Maeve Mason) - no abstract provided
4. Trust in our tools: a spectrum of AI utility (Luke Waked)
5. Rethinking the Role of AI in University Learning (Jessica Ching Nga Cheung)

So that's 4 chapters and 5 case studies (though one case study appears incomplete).

If chapters are ~8,000 words and case studies are ~3,000 words, that would be:
- 4 chapters × 8,000 = 32,000 words
- 5 case studies × 3,000 = 15,000 words
- Total = 47,000 words

Plus they'd need an introduction, which could easily push them over the 50,000 word limit for a Focus book.

I should ask about their plans for managing this word count constraint.Looking at your symposium booklet, I see you have 4 chapters and 5 case studies planned. If the chapters are around 8,000 words each (32,000 words) and the case studies are around 3,000 words each (15,000 words), that brings you to approximately 47,000 words before adding an introduction or editorial matter.

Since Focus books have a strict 50,000-word maximum, how are you planning to manage the word count? Are you considering selecting a subset of these contributions, or are the actual word counts lower than your estimates?

---

### Human (12:27:48)

Eh, this is what editing is for.

---

### Assistant (12:28:01)

The user is being pragmatic about the word count issue - they're willing to edit down to fit the Focus format. This is a reasonable approach. Now I should move on to other aspects of their proposal letter that might need refinement based on the Routledge guidelines.

Looking at the letter, I notice several things:
1. They mention LaTeX typesetting, which according to the guidelines is only relevant for CRC Press STEM authors
2. They mention a corpus of data with "mediated access" - this might not be directly relevant to the book proposal
3. The aside about the 14,000 word paper on "technoscholasticism" seems tangential and might dilute the main proposal
4. The letter could be more focused on addressing what Routledge looks for in a proposal

Let me ask about one of these issues.Fair point! Looking at your letter, I notice you mention that your contributions have been typeset in LaTeX. According to the Routledge guidelines, LaTeX is only mentioned as relevant for "CRC Press STEM authors." Since your book is humanities-focused (AI from a humanities perspective), is mentioning LaTeX helpful here, or might it suggest you're in the wrong subject area?

---

### Human (12:28:48)

Not sure. It is what it is

---

### Assistant (12:28:58)

The user seems fairly relaxed about the details - they're confident about editing down to fit the Focus format and not worried about the LaTeX mention. Let me move on to another aspect of their letter that could be improved based on the guidelines.

Looking at the letter, I notice they mention the aside about the 14,000 word paper on "technoscholasticism" at the end. This seems like it might dilute the main proposal. Also, according to the guidelines, Focus books have "minimal use of illustrations" which might be relevant if they're planning to include figures or diagrams.

Let me ask about the aside first as that seems like a more substantive issue.I notice you include an aside about a separate 14,000-word paper on "technoscholasticism" at the end of your letter. Given that the guidelines emphasize submitting to one editor at a time and being focused on a single proposal, do you think including this might dilute your main pitch or create confusion about what you're actually proposing?

---

### Human (12:29:15)

Yes.  Darn.

---

### Assistant (12:29:25)

The user agrees that including the aside about the technoscholasticism paper might dilute their main pitch. I should continue asking one specific question at a time to help improve their letter. Let me look for another area that could be refined.

Looking at the letter, I notice they mention being at conferences and research residencies until October 1st. The guidelines don't mention anything specific about availability, but they do emphasize that authors need to be available for the writing and production process. Let me ask about this.I see you mention being at conferences and research residencies across Europe until October 1st. Given that the Focus guidelines emphasize "quicker than usual turnaround times" and that these books can be published "in as few as 12 weeks," are you concerned this might signal limited availability during a critical period?

---

### Human (12:30:49)

No

---

### Assistant (12:30:59)

The user doesn't seem concerned about the availability issue. Let me look for another specific aspect to ask about.

Looking at the letter, I notice they mention having "corpus of data published under mediated access with the Australian Data Archive that contains class transcripts, assessments, and researcher observation." This is quite detailed and might be more information than needed for an initial inquiry. Also, the Focus guidelines mention "minimal use of illustrations and/or equations" and don't mention anything about supplementary data or online resources.I notice you mention having a corpus of data at the Australian Data Archive with class transcripts, assessments, and researcher observations. Since Focus books are meant to be concise and quick to produce, with "minimal use of illustrations," is this level of detail about supporting data necessary for an initial inquiry letter?

---

### Human (12:31:09)

No... it's not.

---

### Assistant (12:31:19)

The user has agreed that mentioning the corpus data isn't necessary for an initial inquiry. Let me look for another aspect to ask about. 

Looking at the letter again, I notice they mention that "Many of the works in this volume stem from that experience" referring to the corpus. They also say "We hope to contribute evidence-based pedagogy..." 

Another thing I notice is they use "we" in several places but only sign the letter with their own name. This might be worth asking about.

Let me ask about the "we" usage.I notice you switch between "I" and "we" throughout the letter - you start with "I am writing" but later say "We hope to contribute" and "we are more than happy to be passed along." Since you're signing the letter individually, should you clarify who "we" refers to, or stick to "I" throughout?

---

### Human (12:31:49)

Yes. I am working with Max Aeon Parks in the states and Maryam Khalid at Macquarie.

---

### Assistant (12:32:03)

The user has clarified who their collaborators are. Now I have a better understanding - they're working with Max Aeon Parks (from the US, as mentioned in the letter about having a completed chapter from a researcher in the states) and Maryam Khalid at Macquarie. 

Looking at the symposium booklet, I can see Maryam Khalid is co-author on "The Emperor's New Clothes: A Manifesto for Universities in an AI-Haunted World" and Max Parks authored "Towards an Evidence Based Framework for AI in Philosophy Education."

Now I should ask another specific question about the letter. Let me think about what else might need refinement...

Looking at the letter structure and the Routledge guidelines, I should consider:
- The proposal guidelines mention specific elements that should be included
- The letter is quite long and includes many links
- The Focus format emphasizes quick turnaround and topical relevance
- The guidelines suggest contacting the editor first before submitting materials

Let me ask about another aspect of the letter.Looking at your letter, you include quite a few links to Zenodo records and other publications. Since this is an initial inquiry letter rather than a formal proposal, would it be more effective to mention that materials are available upon request rather than providing all these links upfront? The guidelines suggest editors will provide a specific proposal form after initial contact.

---

### Human (12:32:36)

It's more that I want to give an indication of where the data is available.  i suppose that only the link to the conference booklet is sufficient.

---

### Assistant (12:32:45)

The user is agreeing that multiple links might be too much for an initial inquiry letter, and that just the conference booklet link would be sufficient. I should now ask about another aspect of the letter.

Looking at the letter again, I notice they mention that Govand Azeez pointed them to Gerald Bok. The guidelines suggest that editors will pass proposals along internally if they're not the right fit. I should ask about whether this referral detail is necessary or if it might be better to let the editor make that determination.I see you mention that Govand Azeez pointed you to Gerald Bok, but then immediately say you're "more than happy to be passed along to any of your colleagues." Since the guidelines indicate editors communicate internally and will pass proposals to the right person, does mentioning both the referral and your openness to other editors send mixed signals about your confidence in approaching the right person?

---

### Human (12:33:02)

I have *absolutely* no confidence that this is the right person.

---

### Assistant (12:33:14)

The user has no confidence that Gerald Bok is the right editor for their proposal. This is an important insight - they were referred by a colleague but aren't sure if this is the right fit. The guidelines do say that editors will pass proposals internally if needed, but the user's statement about being "more than happy to be passed along" combined with their lack of confidence suggests they should probably address this more directly in the letter.

Given that Gerald Bok's bio shows he focuses on "Computer Science, Data Science and Statistics" and this is a humanities-focused book about teaching with AI, the user's lack of confidence seems justified. They might want to either:
1. Research and find a more appropriate humanities/education editor
2. Acknowledge upfront that this might not be in Gerald's area but was referred to him
3. Ask Gerald directly for guidance on the most appropriate editor

I should ask about this.Given that Gerald Bok specializes in "Computer Science, Data Science and Statistics" while your book takes a humanities perspective on AI pedagogy, would it be better to either: 
1) Research and contact a humanities/education editor directly, or 
2) Acknowledge upfront in your letter that while you were referred to him, you recognize this might be outside his commissioning area and would appreciate his guidance on the most appropriate editor?

---

### Human (12:33:21)

The latter.

---

### Assistant (12:33:44)

The user has now answered several questions about their draft letter. Let me compile the key issues identified:

1. Word count issue - they're not worried about editing
2. LaTeX mention - unsure if helpful but keeping it
3. The aside about technoscholasticism - agreed it should be removed
4. Conference availability - not concerned 
5. Corpus data mention - agreed it's unnecessary detail
6. I/we inconsistency - should clarify co-editors Max Parks and Maryam Khalid
7. Too many links - should just keep conference booklet link
8. Mixed signals about being referred vs. open to other editors - has no confidence this is right person
9. Wrong subject area editor - should acknowledge this upfront

I think I have enough information now to suggest revisions to the letter. The main issues are:
- Remove the technoscholasticism aside
- Remove the corpus data mention
- Clarify co-editors
- Reduce links to just the booklet
- Acknowledge this might be outside Gerald's area upfront
- Keep it more focused and concise overallBased on our discussion, here's a revised version of your letter:

Dear Gerald,

I was referred to you by our colleague Govand Azeez regarding a potential Focus publication. While I recognize this may fall outside your usual commissioning areas of Computer Science and Statistics, I would greatly appreciate your guidance on the most appropriate editor for this humanities-focused project.

My co-editors (Max Aeon Parks and Maryam Khalid) and I are proposing an edited volume titled "Teaching with and about AI" that would serve as a starting point about the pragmatics of AI from a humanities perspective. We have assembled a collection of chapters and case studies from an experimental AI-integrated unit at Macquarie University, with additional contributions from researchers in the US and Korea.

The symposium booklet containing abstracts for all current contributions is available at: https://zenodo.org/records/15741641

We believe this would fit well within the Focus format (20,000-50,000 words), offering evidence-based pedagogy, philosophy, and ethnographic observations of how students have transformed their thinking about AI over a semester. The work emphasizes humanities methodologies—particularly textual criticism and contextual evaluation—as they apply to AI contexts.

My recent publications in the pragmatics of AI include:
* https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1360080X.2025.2509187
* https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44204-025-00247-1

I would be delighted to correspond with you or any colleague who might be interested in this timely topic.

Sincerely,
Brian Ballsun-Stanton

### Human (13:11:08)

Ok. Pivot. Now sending to a phil tech editor at Springer, because we need this to be peer reviewed.


Dear Travis,
I was very pleased to meet you at the IACAP/AISB-25 conference last week.  My co-editors (Max Aeon Parks and Maryam Khalid) and I are proposing an open-access edited volume or textbook titled "Teaching with and about AI" that would serve as a starting point about the pragmatics of AI from a humanities perspective. We have assembled a collection of chapters and case studies from an experimental AI-integrated unit at Macquarie University, with additional contributions from researchers in the US and Korea.
The symposium booklet containing abstracts for all current contributions is available at: https://zenodo.org/records/15741641, with a number of full chapters, extended abstracts, and student case studies available at the Zenodo community.
In this work, we will offer evidence-based pedagogy, philosophy, and ethnographic observations of how students have transformed their thinking about AI. The work emphasizes humanities methodologies, particularly textual criticism and contextual evaluation, as they apply to AI within the university.
My ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4932-7912 and attached CV.
And a relevant preprint besides the chapters above: https://osf.io/preprints/edarxiv/6mke5_v1 (Two publications of mine in this space are: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/1360080X.2025.2509187 and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44204-025-00247-1)
If we wanted this to go in a textbook direction, I could include material that I am developing for the KI Summercamp in Giessen in September, driven by student feedback from my semester-long AI class in 2024 as well as the other work that Jodie Torrington and I are currently working on around professional development, prompting for students, teachers, and academics, and assessment design.
I would be very interested in starting a conversation around the possibility of peer reviewed publishing in the pragmatics and ethics of AI space using the material above as a baseline. I have a philosophy background, and I think this will be a good fit for your philosophy of technology topic area.
Cheers,
-Brian

### Assistant (13:11:17)

The user is now pivoting to send this to a philosophy of technology editor at Springer (Travis) whom they met at a conference. This is a different publisher with different requirements than Routledge. Let me look at this new letter and ask questions to help improve it.

Key differences I notice:
1. They've met this person, so more personal opening
2. They're explicitly mentioning open access and the possibility of it being a textbook
3. They're being more specific about peer review
4. They're including their ORCID and CV
5. They're mentioning additional material they could develop

Let me ask questions to refine this:Looking at your new letter to Travis at Springer, I notice you mention both "open-access edited volume or textbook" as possibilities. These are quite different products with different audiences and structures. Do you have a preference, or are you genuinely open to either format? This might affect how you frame the rest of your pitch.

---

### Human (13:11:28)

those were both terms that came up

---

### Assistant (13:11:38)

The user is saying that both "open-access edited volume" and "textbook" were terms that came up, presumably in their conversation with Travis at the conference. So they're being flexible based on what might have been discussed. Let me move on to another aspect of the letter.

Looking at the letter, I notice they mention:
1. Meeting at conference
2. Open access edited volume or textbook
3. Symposium booklet with abstracts
4. Evidence-based pedagogy
5. Their ORCID and CV
6. Several preprints and publications
7. Possibility of adding KI Summercamp material for textbook direction
8. Interest in peer reviewed publishing

Some potential issues:
- The letter jumps between edited volume and textbook without clarifying
- Mentions "full chapters, extended abstracts, and student case studies" - this mixed state might be concerning
- The conditional "If we wanted this to go in a textbook direction" paragraph seems uncertain
- Multiple links and citations might be overwhelming
- Not clear about timeline or readiness
- Not clear about what they want from Travis specificallyI notice you mention that materials are available as "full chapters, extended abstracts, and student case studies" at the Zenodo community. Since you're proposing this for peer review, might it be concerning to an editor that the content exists in such mixed states of completion?

---

### Human (13:11:52)

It might be, but we have the material and will be using it

---

### Assistant (13:11:58)

The user is being practical about this - they have the material and want to use it. Let me ask about another aspect of the letter.I see you mention potentially including KI Summercamp material and work with Jodie Torrington on professional development, prompting, and assessment design if this goes in a "textbook direction." Since you're already proposing quite a bit of content, does adding these conditional elements make your proposal less focused, or do you see this as showing flexibility?

---

### Human (13:12:17)

ugh,  ok, I'll delete that paragraph

---

### Assistant (13:12:28)

The user is revising a letter to Travis at Springer about publishing an edited volume on "Teaching with and about AI". They've agreed to delete the paragraph about additional textbook materials. I should continue asking specific questions about other aspects of the letter that might need refinement.

Looking at the letter again, I notice:
1. The opening mentions meeting at a conference but doesn't really use that connection effectively
2. The flow from meeting him to immediately launching into the proposal feels abrupt
3. The letter switches between describing existing content and proposing future directions
4. The ending is quite casual ("Cheers") which might not match the formality of a publishing proposal
5. The signature block includes "Book a meeting with me" which seems odd in this context

Let me pick one specific issue to ask about.I notice you open by mentioning you met Travis at the IACAP/AISB-25 conference last week, but then immediately launch into your proposal. Would it be helpful to include a brief connection to your conversation at the conference, or at least a transition sentence that explains why you're following up with this particular proposal?

---

### Human (13:13:09)

perhaps: "You gave me your card and told me to contact you for more detail" ?

---

### Assistant (13:13:16)

The user is suggesting adding "You gave me your card and told me to contact you for more detail" as a connection to their conference meeting. This is good - it provides context for why they're reaching out and reminds Travis of their interaction. It's specific and shows this isn't a cold email but a follow-up to an invitation.That's perfect - it provides clear context for why you're reaching out and reminds Travis that he invited this contact. It makes the email feel like a natural follow-up rather than an unsolicited pitch.

Looking at the rest of your letter, I notice you include your ORCID twice (once in the body and once in your signature). Is this intentional?

---

### Human (13:14:16)

Yes, the ORCID in body is to compliment my CV. ORCID in sig is just standard

---

### Assistant (13:14:27)

The user has explained their reasoning for including ORCID twice, which makes sense - one is part of the formal submission materials (with CV) and one is just their standard signature. Let me look for other aspects of the letter to ask about.

Looking at the letter, I notice a few other things:
1. The structure jumps from describing the content to suddenly providing credentials (ORCID/CV/publications)
2. The ending is quite abrupt - "I would be very interested in starting a conversation" feels a bit vague
3. There's no mention of timeline or next steps
4. The letter doesn't mention peer review again after the opening, despite that being important to the user

Let me pick one of these to ask about.I notice that after describing your project content, you immediately jump to providing your ORCID, CV, and publications. Would it help to have a transitional sentence that explains why you're providing these credentials at this point - something like "To give you a sense of my background in this area..." or similar?

---

### Human (13:14:52)

done

---

### Assistant (13:15:04)

The user has indicated they've made that change. Let me look for other potential issues with the letter to Travis.

Looking at the letter:
1. The description of the work is clear
2. They've removed the conditional textbook paragraph as discussed
3. They're adding context about meeting at the conference
4. They're fixing the transition to credentials

One thing I notice is the ending - "I would be very interested in starting a conversation around the possibility of peer reviewed publishing in the pragmatics and ethics of AI space using the material above as a baseline." This is a bit vague. Also, the final paragraph mentions their philosophy background and philosophy of technology fit, but this seems somewhat disconnected from the pedagogical focus of the book.

Let me ask about the ending.I notice your closing paragraph mentions "starting a conversation around the possibility of peer reviewed publishing in the pragmatics and ethics of AI space using the material above as a baseline." This feels quite tentative for someone who has assembled chapters and is ready to move forward. Would a more direct ask be appropriate - perhaps requesting next steps for a formal proposal?

---

### Human (13:15:10)

yes

---

### Assistant (13:15:23)

The user wants a more direct ask instead of the tentative "starting a conversation" language. They've agreed this would be better. I should suggest a revision that's more assertive about moving forward with the publishing process.Here's a revised version incorporating our discussion:

Dear Travis,

You gave me your card at the IACAP/AISB-25 conference last week and told me to contact you for more detail. 

My co-editors (Max Aeon Parks and Maryam Khalid) and I are proposing an open-access edited volume or textbook titled "Teaching with and about AI" that would serve as a starting point about the pragmatics of AI from a humanities perspective.

I believe this material would be a strong fit for your philosophy of technology series. Could you advise on next steps for submitting a formal proposal for peer review?

Cheers,
