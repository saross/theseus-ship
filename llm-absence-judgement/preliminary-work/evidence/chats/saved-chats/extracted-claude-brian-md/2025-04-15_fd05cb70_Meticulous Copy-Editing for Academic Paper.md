## Conversation

### Human (06:03:47)

Hi Claude. Please take the role of a highly meticulous copy-editor. You will take *extra* time and be extremely thoughtful in your discussions and considerations. The user, above all else, requires thoughtful and reasoned editing and discussion. We need to ensure that everything is in a single, consistent, and clear register. We also need to remove some words, where possible.

I would like you to highlight issues rather than making corrections. Then, for each issue, please thoughtfully discuss the issue. Make sure any suggested contributions (rare) are in bold so that we may quickly assess them.

Attached is a long paper. My objective is for us to highlight issues with flow, clarity, and consistency, and for you to function as a highly attentive copy editor.

To begin, please provide a functional decomposition of these tasks and give me a readback of the headers of the document.

### Assistant (06:03:58)

 I understand you'd like me to serve as a meticulous copy-editor for your academic paper, focusing on highlighting issues rather than making direct corrections. My approach will be to carefully consider flow, clarity, and consistency throughout the document while suggesting ways to tighten the language.

## Functional Decomposition of Tasks

1. **Document Structure Analysis** - Identify the paper's organization by examining headers and flow
2. **Consistency Check** - Evaluate voice, tense, terminology, and formatting for consistency
3. **Clarity Assessment** - Identify unclear phrasing, complex sentences, or confusing passages
4. **Flow Analysis** - Examine transitions between sections, paragraphs, and ideas
5. **Language Efficiency** - Highlight opportunities for more concise expression
6. **Academic Style Review** - Ensure adherence to academic writing conventions
7. **Citation Checking** - Note any apparent issues with citations

## Document Headers

Here are the main sections of your document:

- **Title**: A University Framework for the Responsible use of Generative AI in Research
- **Abstract**
- **Introduction** (Section 1)
- **Context** (Section 3)
  - Research integrity
  - Human research ethics

---

### Human (06:05:42)

Let's begin with the intro, please. Would you like me to paste in sections?

---

### Assistant (06:05:59)

 I can work with the introduction as it appears in the document you've already provided, so there's no need for you to paste it again. I'll analyze the introduction section and identify issues with flow, clarity, and consistency. Let me begin.

## Introduction Analysis

The introduction establishes the paper's purpose: to provide a strategic framework for universities to navigate the use of AI in research. Here are the issues I've identified:

### Flow and Structure Issues:

1. The opening paragraph effectively sets the stage, but the transition to the second paragraph feels slightly abrupt. There's a sudden shift from general context to mentioning specific Australian universities without explanation of why these two were chosen or how they represent the broader landscape.

2. The fourth paragraph mentions that "most recent studies have focused on the impact of AI on undergraduate teaching..." but this context feels disconnected from the previous paragraphs which were describing the paper's framework. This important contextual information might be better placed earlier to establish the research gap.

3. The paragraph describing the framework's four layers (numbered list) appears before the reader is given a full understanding of the framework's purpose or significance. Without a visual reference (the figure is mentioned but not yet seen), this enumeration may be difficult to follow.

### Clarity Issues:

1. In paragraph 2, the phrase "drawn on insights from two Australian universities" could be more specific about how these insights were gathered (case studies, interviews, policy analysis, etc.).

2. The statement "guide the delivery of communications, infrastructure, process improvements and training" doesn't specify who will deliver these elements or to whom they will be delivered.

3. In paragraph 3, "foundational and adaptable model" is somewhat vague. It would be clearer to specify what makes the model both foundational and adaptable.

4. The final paragraph explaining the paper's structure uses the phrase "unconventional approach to the structure" but doesn't clearly explain what conventional would be or why this approach benefits readers.

### Consistency Issues:

1. The paper uses both "Macquarie University" and "Macquarie" in the same paragraph, which could be standardized.

2. The terms "position statement," "guidance note," and "policy" are all used in the introduction, but their relationships to each other aren't clearly defined until the later paragraphs.

3. The final paragraph of the introduction refers to "our framework," but the ownership and development process of this framework isn't fully clarified until later sections.

### Conciseness Opportunities:

1. The parenthetical explanation "(Macquarie)" after "Macquarie University" could be omitted if the abbreviation is consistently used thereafter.

2. In paragraph 5, "The aim of this paper is to provide a structure to develop guidance in this evolving context" could be more direct: "This paper provides a structure for developing guidance in this evolving context."

3. The final paragraph explaining the paper's organization appears somewhat defensive and could be condensed.

### Suggested Focus Areas:

1. Consider strengthening the introduction by more clearly articulating the research gap this paper fills regarding institutional responses to AI in research.

2. The significance of choosing a principles-based approach could be emphasized earlier to provide a stronger foundation for the framework.

3. The explanation of "Guidance Note" vs. "Policy" could be clarified earlier to help readers understand why this distinction matters.

Would you like me to provide more specific suggestions for any of these issues, or would you prefer I continue to the next section?

---

### Human (06:07:40)

Yes, let's work through specific suggestions. And we might just move things around in the document, since we have many of the things you've asked for later on.

---

### Assistant (06:07:59)

 I understand you'd like to work through specific suggestions for the introduction, and that we might move content from later sections to address some of the issues. Let's go through each issue with more specific recommendations:

### Flow and Structure Suggestions:

1. **Abrupt transition to Australian universities**: 
   Consider adding a brief explanation before mentioning the specific universities:
   
   **"This paper draws on insights from two Australian universities that have independently developed frameworks in response to AI challenges. We provide worked examples of how Macquarie University (Macquarie) and Queensland University of Technology (QUT) have followed this framework..."**

2. **Research gap context placement**:
   Consider moving the research gap statement earlier, perhaps after the first paragraph:
   
   **"While most recent studies have focused on the impact of AI on undergraduate teaching and learning and assessment, discussions of institutional responses to the responsible use of AI for research are much less common. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a strategic framework for navigating this evolving space and promoting the responsible use of AI in research."**

3. **Framework explanation placement**:
   Consider providing a brief overview of the framework's purpose before listing its layers:
   
   **"Our framework offers a structured approach for institutions to develop guidance on AI in research, arranged in four layers that represent the logical sequence for consideration and implementation:"**

### Clarity Suggestions:

1. **Specificity about university insights**:
   Consider clarifying the methodology used:
   
   **"This paper draws on insights from two Australian universities' experiences developing and implementing AI frameworks, including policy development processes, consultation strategies, and implementation challenges."**

2. **Delivery clarification**:
   Specify the audience and implementers:
   
   **"...guide institutional leaders and research offices in delivering communications, infrastructure, process improvements and training to support researchers in the responsible use of AI."**

3. **Foundational and adaptable model**:
   Clarify these attributes:
   
   **"Our framework serves as a foundational model that addresses core ethical principles while remaining adaptable to different institutional contexts, disciplinary needs, and the rapidly evolving AI landscape."**

4. **Paper structure explanation**:
   Consider a more straightforward explanation:
   
   **"The structure of this paper follows the four layers of our framework, with each section corresponding to a layer: context, position, implementation and review. This organization allows readers to follow the framework's logic while understanding both the theoretical foundations and practical applications."**

### Consistency Suggestions:

1. **University naming**:
   Choose either "Macquarie University" throughout or establish "Macquarie" as the abbreviation once and use it consistently.

2. **Terminology clarification**:
   Consider adding a brief explanation of these terms early in the introduction:
   
   **"In this paper, the term 'framework' refers to the overarching structure guiding institutional governance, strategic direction, and adaptation to AI-related developments. 'Policy,' on the other hand, refers to specific institutional rules and formal guidelines that establish compliance requirements for researchers around their use of AI."**

3. **Framework ownership**:
   Clarify the development process earlier:
   
   **"Our framework, developed through analysis of current literature and practical implementation at two universities, serves as a foundational and adaptable model..."**

### Conciseness Suggestions:

1. **Abbreviation handling**:
   Introduce Macquarie University (Macquarie) once, then use the abbreviation consistently.

2. **More direct aim statement**:
   Revise to: **"This paper provides a structure for developing guidance in this evolving context."**

3. **Streamlined structure explanation**:
   Consider: **"The paper's structure follows the framework's four layers, making the conceptual organization transparent and accessible."**

These suggestions aim to enhance the introduction while minimizing disruption to your existing content. Would you like to focus on implementing any particular suggestions first, or should we continue analyzing the next section?

---

### Human (06:08:08)

Ok, but if we're adding words, we need to remove more.

---

### Assistant (06:08:27)

 You're absolutely right - we need to be mindful of word count. Let's refine the suggestions to ensure we're removing more words than we're adding. I'll focus on identifying redundancies and opportunities for significant compression in the introduction.

### Major Compression Opportunities:

1. **First paragraph redundancies**:
   The current opening contains repetitive phrases about "adapting" practices. Consider condensing:
   
   FROM: "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses both opportunities and risks for the integrity and quality of research. To support researchers in using AI responsibly, institutions must adapt their research governance and management practices to mitigate the risks of AI while remaining flexible to allow for its innovative use in research."
   
   TO: **"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses both opportunities and risks for research integrity. Institutions must balance risk mitigation with flexibility to allow innovative AI use in research."** 
   (Reduction of ~30 words)

2. **Second paragraph efficiency**:
   FROM: "This paper draws on insights from two Australian universities to provide a strategic framework for navigating this evolving space and promoting the responsible use of AI in research. We provide worked examples of how Macquarie University (Macquarie) and Queensland University of Technology (QUT) have followed this framework to develop a principles-based position statement and guide the delivery of communications, infrastructure, process improvements and training to support researchers in the responsible use of AI."
   
   TO: **"Drawing on experiences from Macquarie University and Queensland University of Technology (QUT), we provide a strategic framework for responsible AI use in research. These cases demonstrate how to develop principles-based position statements that guide communications, infrastructure, processes and training."** 
   (Reduction of ~35 words)

3. **Third paragraph compression**:
   FROM: "Our framework, based on current literature and practical implementation plans, serves as a foundational and adaptable model offering clarity and direction for research institutions."
   
   This sentence could be removed entirely or merged with another paragraph. (Reduction of ~24 words)

4. **Research gap paragraph**:
   FROM: "While most recent studies have focused on the impact of AI on undergraduate teaching and learning and assessment, discussions of institutional responses to the responsible use of AI for research are much less common. Universities are uniquely placed to instigate proactive measures to mitigate serious risks posed by AI, such as creating fake or unreproducible research, which threaten research credibility and public trust. Our paper emphasises developing an institutional position statement that applies research integrity principles to AI challenges, serving as common ground for mobilising training, communication and infrastructure initiatives to meet specific institutional and research needs."
   
   TO: **"Unlike the abundant research on AI in teaching, institutional responses to AI in research remain underdeveloped. Universities must address serious risks including fake or unreproducible research that threaten credibility. Our paper proposes institutional position statements that apply integrity principles to AI challenges, providing common ground for training, communication and infrastructure initiatives."** 
   (Reduction of ~45 words)

5. **Fifth paragraph streamlining**:
   FROM: "The aim of this paper is to provide a structure to develop guidance in this evolving context. The literature and discussion in this paper should help inform institutional decision-making related to governance and policy implementation. This paper is a case study, allowing readers to apply our lessons learned and models in the development of their own institutional policies, using the framework we extrapolated from our efforts."
   
   TO: **"This paper provides guidance for institutional decision-making on AI governance in a rapidly evolving landscape. As a case study, it allows readers to apply our framework and lessons to their own institutional policies."** 
   (Reduction of ~40 words)

6. **Framework explanation efficiency**:
   The numbered list explaining the framework's four layers could be made more concise by removing repetitive phrases like "describes" at the beginning of each item.

7. **Final paragraph elimination**:
   The final paragraph explaining the paper's unconventional structure could potentially be removed entirely, as the structure becomes evident through reading. (Reduction of ~150 words)

These compression opportunities could reduce the introduction by approximately 300+ words while preserving the essential content. Would you like me to apply this approach to any specific paragraphs in the introduction to create a more polished, concise version?

### Human (06:15:54)

Ok. Those comments were effective. 

Onto the next section and subsection


```

\section{Context}\label{sec2}

Policy development by research institutions is shaped by external and internal contextual environments, and in the case of AI, the relationships between these environments are complex: the increasing use of AI is creating new ways of conducting research; introducing new techniques, methods and complex datasets, and challenges around authorship, integrity and judgement. This poses challenges to accepted research practices and requires institutions to reassess institutional policy and infrastructure to support researchers and university staff in research integrity, human research ethics, research degree requirement, data management, sector policies and terms of service. 


\subsection{Research integrity}\label{research-ethics-and-integrity} 

In Australia, the NHMRC \textit{Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research} \parencite{nhmrc_australian_2018} establishes principles that, extended, also guide responsible AI use in research, notably rigour, transparency, and accountability. Researchers must document and transparently disclose AI integration into their research, detailing AI tools, methodologies, and potential biases \parencite[Principles 2, 3]{nhmrc_australian_2018}. Comprehensive records, including logs of AI interactions, prompts, and post-processing methods, should be securely maintained and made accessible to promote reproducibility.

Disclosure practices vary widely across disciplines and institutions. Many journals currently require minimal disclosure following COPE guidelines \parencite{committee_on_publication_ethics_cope_2024}. However, some have started mandating detailed disclosures. For instance, APA requires authors to explicitly document AI use in their methods sections and to provide full AI outputs as supplemental materials \parencite*{american_psychological_association_apa_2023}. Practical disciplinary trends include attaching AI-generated logs and prompts as supplemental material \parencite[e.g.][]{butson_ai_2024, shiferaw_spatial_2024}.

### Assistant (06:16:07)

 ## Analysis of Context Section Introduction

### Flow and Structure Issues:

1. The context section opens with a complex, lengthy sentence that introduces multiple concepts at once, making it difficult to follow. The sentence attempts to establish the complex relationships between external and internal environments but may overwhelm the reader with too many ideas.

2. The transition from the broad context introduction to the specific subsection on research integrity is somewhat abrupt. There could be a clearer link explaining how research integrity fits into the overall context framework.

### Clarity Issues:

1. The phrase "in the case of AI, the relationships between these environments are complex" is somewhat vague. It would be more helpful to specify exactly how these relationships are complex.

2. The list of areas (research integrity, human research ethics, etc.) at the end of the first paragraph appears without explanation of how these connect to the main argument about contextual environments.

3. The term "extended" in the phrase "establishes principles that, extended, also guide responsible AI use" is unclear - it's not immediately evident what this extension entails or who is doing the extending.

### Consistency Issues:

1. The section uses both "AI" and "artificial intelligence" interchangeably, which could be standardized.

### Conciseness Opportunities:

1. The opening paragraph contains repetitive phrasing around "challenges" - "poses challenges" and "challenges around" appear in close proximity.

2. The phrase "reassess institutional policy and infrastructure" contains redundant use of "institutional" since it was established earlier that the focus is on research institutions.

## Analysis of Research Integrity Subsection

### Flow and Structure Issues:

1. The paragraph on disclosure practices introduces specific examples (APA) without first establishing why disclosure is important in the AI context specifically.

2. The final paragraph appears to be missing from the excerpt you provided, making it difficult to assess the overall flow of this subsection.

### Clarity Issues:

1. The reference to "COPE guidelines" assumes reader familiarity with this acronym and its significance, which may not be the case for all readers.

2. The statement about "Practical disciplinary trends" would benefit from clearer explanation of what these disciplines are and why their practices are noteworthy.

### Conciseness Opportunities:

1. The phrase "Researchers must document and transparently disclose AI integration into their research, detailing AI tools, methodologies, and potential biases" contains some repetition that could be condensed.

### Suggested Revisions:

For the context introduction paragraph:
**"Policy development by research institutions is shaped by both external and internal environments. AI introduces new research techniques, methods and datasets while raising questions about authorship, integrity and judgment. These developments challenge established practices, requiring institutions to update policies and infrastructure in areas including research integrity, ethics, degree requirements, data management, sector policies and terms of service."**

For the research integrity introduction:
**"The NHMRC Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research provides principles applicable to AI in research: rigour, transparency, and accountability. When using AI, researchers must document tools, methods, potential biases, and maintain records of interactions, prompts, and post-processing to ensure reproducibility."**

Would you like me to continue with specific suggestions for the disclosure practices paragraph as well?

---

### Human (06:18:33)

First revision good. We're rejecting the second. Please proceed.

---

### Assistant (06:18:41)

 I understand that the first suggested revision for the context introduction was helpful, but the second for research integrity was not suitable. Let's continue with the analysis of the rest of the section.

## Further Analysis of Research Integrity Subsection

### Disclosure Practices Paragraph:

#### Flow and Structure Issues:
1. The transition from general NHMRC principles to specific disclosure practices is somewhat abrupt without explaining the connection between transparency principles and disclosure requirements.

2. The examples (COPE, APA) are presented sequentially without a clear indication of why these specific examples were chosen or how they relate to each other in a progression of disclosure requirements.

#### Clarity Issues:
1. The phrase "practical disciplinary trends" doesn't clearly explain which disciplines are being referenced or why their practices constitute "trends."

2. The parenthetical reference to Butson and Shiferaw doesn't explain what these examples demonstrate about disclosure practices.

#### Conciseness Opportunities:
1. "Many journals currently require minimal disclosure following COPE guidelines" could be more direct.

#### Suggested Revision for Disclosure Practices:
**"Disclosure practices for AI use vary widely. While many journals follow minimal COPE guidelines, others like APA require explicit documentation in methods sections with complete AI outputs as supplementary materials. Recent publications have established precedent by attaching AI logs and prompts as appendices."**

This revision:
- Connects more logically to the previous paragraph on transparency
- Establishes a progression from minimal to more comprehensive disclosure
- Clarifies the purpose of the example publications
- Reduces word count by approximately 30%

Would you like me to continue with the analysis of other paragraphs in this section that weren't included in your excerpt, or would you prefer to move to another section?

### Human (06:19:36)

\subsubsection{Acknowledgement, disclosure, and documentation}
Acknowledging AI use separately from general acknowledgements, such as under its own heading akin to funding or conflicts of interest, can clarify the extent and role of AI contributions. Simply acknowledging AI use is insufficient for rigorous peer assessment; detailed disclosure, proportional to the AI involvement, should include specific prompts, model versions, and outputs \parencite*{ballsun-stanton_briefing_2024}. While no consistent standard exists yet across journals or disciplines, Macquarie and QUT have initiated comprehensive requirements for postgraduate students. Macquarie mandates documentation of AI use in each student's thesis, including interactions and supervisory approval, while QUT requires detailed written disclosure of AI use within theses \parencite{queensland_university_of_technology_ai_2025}.
However, pragmatic concerns about the practicality of these standards highlight implementation challenges. The required `active supervision and written consent' may be burdensome; thus, institutions must balance rigorous expectations with realistic supervisory practices. Both Macquarie and QUT acknowledge this tension, placing accountability largely on supervisors while recognizing a need for clearer norms and ongoing education. 
Therefore, effective, ethical, and responsible AI integration in research necessitates explicit institutional guardrails and ongoing training aligned with evolving ethical standards. Institutions should support researchers in applying FAIR principles \parencite[see][]{wilkinson_fair_2016}, making AI-related data and methods transparent to strengthen research integrity and reproducibility. Rather than banning generative AI—which risks unintended shadow use, institutions should proactively equip researchers with the skills to critically evaluate and transparently disclose AI involvement, addressing ethical challenges while leveraging AI’s potential for scholarly innovation \parencite{sadasivan_can_2023, ben_jabeur_artificial_2023}. An adaptable disclosure checklist supporting discipline-specific guidelines is provided in Appendix 1 for practical guidance across diverse research contexts.

---

### Assistant (06:19:50)

 ## Analysis of "Acknowledgement, disclosure, and documentation" Subsection

### Flow and Structure Issues:

1. The subsection begins directly with specific methods of acknowledgment without first establishing why acknowledgment is distinct from the disclosure practices discussed in the previous section. This creates a slightly disjointed transition.

2. The final paragraph jumps to broad recommendations before fully resolving the tensions identified in the previous paragraph, creating a somewhat hasty conclusion.

3. The mention of Appendix 1 at the very end introduces a new element without adequate preparation or explanation of how it relates to the preceding discussion.

### Clarity Issues:

1. The phrase "active supervision and written consent" appears in quotation marks but without clear attribution to its source (presumably from one of the university policies, but this isn't explicitly stated).

2. The term "FAIR principles" is introduced with a citation but without a brief explanation of what these principles entail, which may be unfamiliar to some readers.

3. The concept of "shadow use" is introduced without definition, assuming reader familiarity with this term.

### Consistency Issues:

1. There's inconsistent punctuation with quotation marks - single quotes in "active supervision and written consent" but regular quotations elsewhere.

2. The paragraph mentions both "Macquarie" and "QUT" without restating their full names, which may need consistency with how they were introduced earlier.

### Conciseness Opportunities:

1. "Acknowledging AI use separately from general acknowledgements, such as under its own heading akin to funding or conflicts of interest" contains redundant phrasing about separation.

2. The final paragraph contains several conjunctive phrases ("effective, ethical, and responsible") that could be streamlined.

3. The concluding sentence about the appendix could be integrated more efficiently.

### Suggested Revisions:

For paragraph 1:
**"A dedicated section for AI disclosure, similar to funding statements or conflicts of interest, helps clarify AI contributions. Rigorous disclosure should be proportional to AI involvement, including specific prompts, model versions, and outputs. While journal standards vary, both Macquarie and QUT now require comprehensive documentation for postgraduate theses, including supervisory approval."**

For paragraph 2:
**"Implementation challenges exist, particularly around the practicality of 'active supervision and written consent' requirements. Both universities acknowledge this tension, placing primary accountability on supervisors while recognizing the need for clearer norms."**

For paragraph 3:
**"Responsible AI integration requires institutional guardrails and ongoing training. Applying FAIR principles to AI use enhances research transparency and reproducibility. Rather than prohibitions that might drive shadow use, institutions should equip researchers to evaluate and disclose AI contributions ethically. Appendix 1 provides an adaptable disclosure checklist for diverse research contexts."**

These revisions maintain the key content while improving flow, clarity, and conciseness. Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of these suggestions in more detail?
