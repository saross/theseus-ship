### Human (04:51:30)

Hi Claude. I need a signposting paragraph in the introduction (%TODO Signpost). My colleague says: "we should probably mention what the 'main' paper is about at some point..."

Please ask me any necessary questions to make this signposting paragraph, appropriate to the register we are working in.

The user needs a signposting paragraph for the introduction. Looking at the document, I can see the introduction has established:
1. The central thesis about AI tools lacking judgment despite linguistic capabilities
2. The concept of "technoscholasticism" as a framework
3. The three dimensions of judgment deficiency
4. The research approach using autoethnography

The TODO is after paragraph 4 which discusses the investigation approach. So the signposting paragraph needs to outline what's coming in the rest of the paper.

Looking at the section headings:
- Section 2: Theoretical Framework: Judgment in Research
- Section 3: Methodology  
- Section 4: Case Studies of AI Research Tools
- Section 5: Reflective Analysis
- Section 6: Conclusion

I need to ask questions to understand:
1. How detailed should the signposting be?
2. Are there any particular aspects or findings they want to emphasize in the signposting?
3. Should it maintain the critical tone established in the introduction?
4. How should it transition from the autoethnographic approach mentioned in paragraph 4?<think>
Looking at the document structure and the introduction so far, I need to create a signposting paragraph that outlines the paper's structure. The introduction has established:
- The central argument about AI lacking judgment despite linguistic capabilities
- The technoscholasticism framework
- Three dimensions of judgment deficiency
- The autoethnographic research approach

I need to understand how to best connect these elements to the paper's structure.
</think>

To craft an effective signposting paragraph, I need to understand a few things:

1. **Emphasis and flow**: Which aspect would you like to emphasize as the primary thread connecting the sections - the theoretical framework of technoscholasticism, the empirical findings from your case studies, or the progression from theory through evidence to implications?

2. **Level of detail**: Should the signposting briefly mention each major section, or focus on the key argumentative moves (theory → evidence → analysis → implications)?

3. **Connection to prior paragraph**: The fourth paragraph ends with examining "limitations through the framework of technoscholasticism" to help researchers develop "more realistic expectations." Should the signposting paragraph emphasize how each section contributes to this practical goal?

4. **Any specific findings or contributions**: Are there particular insights from Sections 4 or 5 that you'd like to preview (without giving too much away), or should the signposting remain at a structural level?

The progression. This paper is about us creating the idea of technoscholasticism and then supporting it with evidence. I think the key argumentative moves are more important here. And yes, it should link to our thesis paragraph and the preceding intro paragraphs. We want the main points that we haven't already brought up, to orient the reader.

The user wants a signposting paragraph that:
1. Focuses on the progression and key argumentative moves
2. Links to the thesis about technoscholasticism 
3. Orients the reader to what's coming without repeating what's already been said
4. Emphasizes how they create the idea of technoscholasticism and support it with evidence

Looking at the structure:
- Section 2: Theoretical Framework (establishing the concept)
- Section 3: Methodology 
- Section 4: Case Studies (evidence)
- Section 5: Reflective Analysis (synthesis)
- Section 6: Research Tool Design Requirements (mentioned in TODO)
- Section 7: Conclusion

The key argumentative moves seem to be:
1. Establishing the theoretical framework of technoscholasticism and judgment deficiency
2. Presenting empirical evidence from multiple AI tools
3. Analyzing patterns across tools to validate the framework
4. Moving from critique to constructive proposals for tool design

I should write this in active voice, be direct, and connect it smoothly to the preceding paragraph about understanding limitations through technoscholasticism.

Let me revise the signposting paragraph to better match the style guide requirements:

1. Use active voice and first-person plural
2. Break longer sentences into shorter units
3. Australian spelling (recognising, centre, etc.)
4. Direct assertions without excessive complexity
5. Remove em-dashes
6. Make it flow naturally from the preceding paragraph

The paragraph should orient readers to the paper's structure while emphasising the progression from theory to evidence to implications.I've created a signposting paragraph that connects your theoretical framework to the evidence and progression of the paper. The paragraph:

- Links directly to your thesis about technoscholasticism
- Emphasises the progression from theory to empirical validation
- Highlights key argumentative moves without repetition
- Uses active voice and clear transitions
- Ends by connecting back to the practical goal of effective AI tool integration

The paragraph avoids repeating concepts already introduced (like the three dimensions of judgment or the autoethnographic approach) while orienting readers to how each section builds the central argument about technoscholasticism as a fundamental characteristic rather than a temporary limitation.
