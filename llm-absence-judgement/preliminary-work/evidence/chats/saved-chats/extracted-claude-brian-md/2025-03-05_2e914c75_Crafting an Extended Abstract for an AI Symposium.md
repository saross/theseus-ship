Hi Claude. Attached is a call for abstracts a colleague has made. 

What I would like you to do is to ask us a series of questions, one at a time, until you believe you have sufficient information to craft an extended abstract. Then present the outline for the abstract (~300 words, very hierarchical, indications where citations are necessary, etc) for us to approve, provide more citations for, etc... and then we'll write the thing.

So, I've an idea of "Technoaristotelianism" -- the historical practice of privileging a source (Aristotle, the canon, etc) over mere "Empiricii" 

(Honestly, I just want an excuse to cite a lot of Ars Magica ideas in the middle of a Philosophy convention)

I also have a more prosaic failed google grant on philosophic benchmarks and my three red lines (induction capabilities, acting on deception, persistence of memory) that we might do. 

Dunno. 

Please begin.

 I'll help you develop an extended abstract for the symposium on "Reimagining AI Agents: Artificial, Angelic, or Adversarial Intelligences?" by asking questions one at a time to gather sufficient information. Let's start with the most fundamental question:

Which of your two ideas would you prefer to develop for this symposium - the "Technoaristotelianism" concept examining historical privileging of authoritative sources over empirical evidence, or the philosophical benchmarks with your three red lines (induction capabilities, acting on deception, persistence of memory)?
