Here is something I gave to OpenAI's deep research, plus its questions. 

I would like you to do a better job. Be specific, intentional, conscientious, meticulous, and triple-check your claims. Take extra extra extra time. Engage in proleptic reasoning and look for evidence against your claims before making them.

I understand you need comprehensive research on Digital Humanities as of 2025, creating an annotated bibliography to support a SWOT analysis update. Your request is detailed and well-structured, outlining specific research areas, source requirements, and annotation formats.

I'll launch a thorough research process to address all your requirements, with special attention to:
- The conceptual evolution of Digital Humanities since 2020
- Current academic landscape globally
- Relationship with generative AI
- Regional understandings (prioritizing Australia, then UK, North America, and Europe)
- Using Chicago author-date citation style
- Being meticulous and triple-checking all claims

I'll begin the comprehensive research process now!
