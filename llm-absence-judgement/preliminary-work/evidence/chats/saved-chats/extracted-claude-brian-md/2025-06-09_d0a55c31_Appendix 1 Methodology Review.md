## Conversation

### Human (05:54:24)

Ok. Here's what I'm thinking about for Appendix 1. What am I missing, how can I revise it?

### Assistant (05:55:08)

The user is asking me to review their Appendix 1 about their AI-Autointerviewing methodology. Let me analyze what they've written and consider what might be missing or could be improved.

Looking at the appendix, they describe:
1. The purpose - using LLMs for thinking through ideas (not first drafts)
2. The process - iterative auto-interview technique
3. Key prompt structure and examples
4. The importance of context and transcription
5. The multi-model approach
6. The editing requirements

What might be missing or need revision:
1. They could be more specific about the actual mechanics - how many iterations, how long this took
2. They could discuss limitations or failures of the approach more explicitly
3. They could provide more concrete examples of how the process evolved their thinking
4. The connection to their main argument about judgment could be stronger
5. They might want to discuss how this method itself demonstrates both the capabilities and limitations of AI tools
6. The appendix ends abruptly - needs a stronger conclusion
7. Some technical details about version control, file management might be helpful
8. They mention OSF but don't have the URL yet

Let me provide constructive feedback without being complimentary, focusing on substantive improvements.<think>
The user has provided an appendix describing their AI-autointerviewing methodology. I need to analyze what's missing and suggest revisions. Key areas to consider:

1. Concrete details about implementation
2. Connection to main thesis about judgment
3. Limitations and failures
4. Structure and flow
5. Technical specifics
6. Stronger conclusion

I should avoid praise and focus on constructive improvements.

Your appendix captures the basic methodology but lacks several critical elements that would strengthen its contribution:

## Missing Elements

**Quantitative Details**: How many hours did this process actually take compared to traditional writing? You mention it's "not faster" but provide no concrete metrics. How many questions did each model typically ask per section? How many transcript pages resulted?

**Failure Analysis**: You've documented what worked but not what failed. Were there sections where this approach broke down? Did certain types of conceptual work resist this decomposition? Your main argument concerns AI's lack of judgment—surely this manifested in the autointerviewing process itself.

**Reflexive Connection**: The appendix doesn't adequately connect to your central thesis. How did using AI to critique AI reveal the technoscholastic tendencies you identify? This recursive element deserves explicit analysis.

**Process Evolution**: Did your prompting strategy evolve during the project? The appendix presents a polished workflow but doesn't reveal the iterative development that likely occurred.

## Structural Issues

The opening paragraph conflates augmentation claims with methodology description. Consider separating:
- Paragraph 1: What the appendix documents
- Paragraph 2: Theoretical positioning (augmentation vs automation)
- Paragraph 3: Practical implementation

The transcription section interrupts the flow. Either integrate it more smoothly or create a distinct subsection for technical infrastructure.

## Specific Revisions Needed

1. **Add concrete example**: Show a complete exchange—question, response, how it shaped the text. The single question example lacks your response and its integration into the manuscript.

2. **Document judgment moments**: Where did you override AI suggestions? Where did human judgment prove essential? This directly supports your thesis.

3. **Version control details**: You mention GitHub and Overleaf but don't explain the workflow. How did you manage multiple model outputs? Track iterations?

4. **Strengthen conclusion**: The appendix ends weakly. Connect back to your argument about AI as tool versus agent. What does this methodology reveal about appropriate human-AI collaboration boundaries?

5. **Address the obvious critique**: Isn't using AI to develop a paper critiquing AI's judgment capabilities inherently problematic? Acknowledge and address this directly.

Would you like me to suggest specific paragraph-level revisions for any of these areas?

### Human (08:15:19)

Not sure about hours taken. The transcript that was used to build the final paper was 32772 words, including questions and prompts. (For a first draft paper of 14k words, that we are editing down.) The models usually asked between 5-10 questions per subsection or section (depending on scope set). 

The failure analysis: Mostly, some questions were naff. o3 tended to go in very strange lines. The questions were generally quite good and useful, and insofar as they followed deductive patterns (they expanded what I already put in), it was an excellent thing.

Reflexive: Mostly, this is part of the declaration of use, plus exploring routes for mundane utility. The whole point is that I was playing with these models to see where the places of utility were. And using as a tool, less as a search, and more as something to reflect my words is genuinely useful.

Process: No, this technique was something I experimented with on a prior project. I'm very happy. Effectively, by choosing a very deliberate scope for each stage, and iterating, it worked very well. So there was absolutely quite a lot of iteration, the problem is that it's a word here and there as I do this across 5 different projects.

Let's figure out how to restructure this. It's an appendix on my methodology of paper, an addendum to the ai use disclosure. It's not the paper itself.

### Assistant (08:16:29)

The user wants to restructure the appendix, keeping in mind:
1. It's an appendix on methodology, not the main paper
2. It's an addendum to the AI use disclosure
3. They have concrete numbers: 32,772 words of transcript for 14k word draft
4. Models asked 5-10 questions per subsection
5. The technique wasn't new - they'd used it before
6. The failures were mostly "naff" questions from o3
7. The focus should be on mundane utility

I need to suggest a clearer structure that positions this as a methodological appendix, not a theoretical contribution. The style guide emphasizes clarity, directness, and Australian spelling.<think>
The user wants to restructure this as a methodological appendix, not a theoretical piece. They've provided concrete metrics (32,772 words of transcript for 14k draft, 5-10 questions per subsection) and clarified that this technique wasn't developed for this paper but applied from prior work. The focus should be on documenting the method for transparency and potential replication, not making theoretical claims.

Key restructuring needs:
1. Position clearly as methodological documentation
2. Add the concrete metrics
3. Streamline to focus on process, not theory
4. Remove defensive/justificatory tone
5. Make it more procedural
</think>

Here's a restructured approach for your appendix:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```

The restructured version is cleaner and more focused on documenting the methodology rather than making theoretical claims. Key improvements:

1. **Clearer positioning**: Opens by establishing this as methodological documentation, not theoretical contribution
2. **Concrete metrics**: Incorporates the 32,772 words and 5-10 questions data
3. **Procedural focus**: Organized into clear implementation sections
4. **Removed defensive tone**: No longer justifying the approach, just documenting it
5. **Practical outcomes**: Clearly states what worked and what didn't
6. **Brief conclusion**: Ties back to main paper without overreaching

The restructure maintains academic rigor while being more direct about what this appendix is: a methodological note for transparency and potential replication.Key structural changes:

1. **Repositioned as pure methodology**: Removed theoretical justifications and focused on documenting the process for transparency and replication

2. **Added concrete metrics upfront**: 32,772 words of transcript for 14,000-word draft immediately establishes scale

3. **Clearer sectioning**:
   - Overview (what and why)
   - Technical Implementation (how)
   - Practical Outcomes (results)
   - Documentation (reproducibility)

4. **Removed the defensive tone**: No longer arguing for the approach's validity, just documenting what you did

5. **Streamlined technical details**: Kept essential workflow elements but removed interrupting passages

6. **Brief, functional conclusion**: Connects to main argument without overreaching

This structure better serves an appendix's purpose: providing methodological transparency without making it a theoretical battleground. The focus stays on "here's what we did" rather than "here's why it matters."

Missing elements you might still add:
- Specific example of a question → response → text transformation
- Brief note on why certain models were better for certain tasks
- OSF URL when available
