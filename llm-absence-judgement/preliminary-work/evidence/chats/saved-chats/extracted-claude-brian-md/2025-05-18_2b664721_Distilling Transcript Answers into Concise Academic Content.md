## Conversation

### Human (04:33:24)

Hi Claude. My colleague and I are chatting about the questions in the transcript for section 4. (Also, the previous thread's outline was attached in project knowledge.)

The task to begin, here, is to take my earlier answers to each question, plus the discussion from my colleague and myself, and crunch down our answers such that 
a) our register is preserved
b) there is much less empty filler-conversation in the questions.

Are you ready to begin?

---

### Assistant (04:33:33)

Alright, so the task is clear. I'm being asked to:

1. Take the transcribed answers/discussions from the user and their colleague about Section 4
2. Distill these into more concise content that:
   - Preserves their academic register/tone
   - Eliminates filler conversation and unnecessary language
   - Maintains the substance of their points

The user has indicated they don't want praise or flattery, just focused assistance on transforming their inputs into more effective academic writing. They've shared an outline for Section 4 in the project knowledge, which I should reference as I work.

The user wants me to produce markdown in an artifact, which will likely be a refined outline or draft text for Section 4 of their paper.

They mention questions in the transcript, so it seems there was a Q&A format to their discussions that I'll need to parse through and organize.

I'll need to apply critical thinking, check claims, and consider counterarguments as I process their content.

I'll confirm I'm ready to begin and then ask for the first transcript or content they'd like me to process.I'm ready to begin transforming your transcribed answers into concise, academically rigorous content. I'll focus on preserving your register while eliminating filler conversation, structuring the content logically, and maintaining the substance of your arguments.

Please share the first transcript you'd like me to process, and I'll create a markdown artifact with the distilled content.

\section*{Section 4: Outline Rejigger - Question 1}
\subsection*{Question Text}
Which specific AI research tools should be your primary focus in Section 4, and which should be demoted to "Other Tools"?
\subsection*{Transcription}
Okay, section four outline rejigger.
Uh, question one.
What specific AI research tools should be your primary focus in section four and which should be demoted to other tools?
Um, I'm sure Shawn put something in the outline for this, but
the tools that offered um genuine pragmatic utility.
My goodness. Genuine are these whatever.
Um.
This is.
[cough]
The tools that offered specific pragmatic utility are OpenAI's suite of tools, specifically OpenAI Deep Research, OpenAI [Gippet / GPT] 4.5 and to a notably lesser degree um OpenAI's uh reasoning models of uh 03 and 01 Pro.
Ah, that's not right. I don't understand these why I am so. Okay. Um.
For Anthropic, the I don't know. Oh no no no no no. Oh no. Shoot.
[unclear] for this? I don't not for this?
Yeah, okay. These are supposed to be.
For Anthropic, uh Claude 37 uh slash reasoning, but also Anthropic research which dropped in this month, May, um has proven shockingly useful and is of the same kind, if slightly better degree than uh OpenAI's Deep Research.
We have uh Google's Gemini Pro 2503-25, although a new model just dropped today that I have to investigate.
Uh, but also um
what was it called?
Google Gemini Advanced Deep uh no. Google Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research.
May- I had put in a to-do for me to check if they call it Deep or not.
Um, which is
No, we need to speak to it even though it's crap because it's of the same kind if a lower degree than the other two. Um, specifically we need to speak to its
searching parameters.
Uh, then we need a small section on Hugging Face's Open Deep Research.
Then in other models we need or in other utilities, we need sub-subsections. Yes. Sub-subsections on
OpenAI's Operator, Anthropic's computer use, Elicit's systematic reports. Uh remind me to double check that one because we only got access to one of them, um and it may not be their systematic reports, whatever, it doesn't matter. It's true. Uh Perplexity's Deep Research.
Yes.
Um so all of those need to be in in the need to be in the smaller section. Or sub-subsection on other videos.


You: is, what specific AI research tools should be your primary focus in Section 4 and what should be demoted to other tools? Shawn Ross: Right. You: And so currently we have open eyes suite of tools. Shawn Ross: Yep. Particularly yeah, we're particularly after like deep research and probably and 4.5 and 03 there. You: Uh, yeah. And just looking at the outline because we might as well reflect on the outline as we go through this. Yeah, it's it's mostly deep research. That we're talking and O3. So I am. Shawn Ross: Because yeah. Yeah, and I, I did, I did, like I've been testing prompts in O3 but I haven't. I haven't used it in anything in production because I found nothing that. Oh, three does that, that I specifically need that. Another model doesn't do better. You: Yeah, no, I've definitely found the same thing and then we have anthropic which is quad 37 and anthropic research. Shawn Ross: Yep. You: and then it keeps going and then we have Google's research, tools, Gemini, Which I think is quite useful, mostly because it's, it's a really good stamp collecting demonstration. Shawn Ross: Well, we did you I mean, we used open deep research to generate. Yeah. You: And then it we we have a nod towards open deep research. and then, Yeah, we used it. I get section and then we have other tools operator computer Shawn Ross: Yeah. You: use illicit perplexity. Is that? Shawn Ross: That seems that seems about, right? I've, I've started using Gemini a bit more if no, but I did also, yeah, I did also test it. Like, with the same some of the You: Yeah. Shawn Ross: set. I it's in the rotation for testing. You: oh, yes, it like it is and and like, we may want to have a bit more in Google's, research tools, but like, Shawn Ross: Mmm. You: I haven't found that. It's persuasive. In any specific place that's worth doing? Shawn Ross: Yeah no. Again it's kind of like oh three in that but the the it, it's competent You: Yeah. Shawn Ross: at a. Oh, three in Gemini are like mediocre at everything. But I haven't really You: Yeah. Shawn Ross: found the, you know, I I the thing that I honestly, the thing I use O3 most for is when I need to have search turned on and get a reasonable answer to like a technical question that is to, to new to be in the training data for for Claude. You: Except that I'm I, I use Claude search this morning and it's just Shawn Ross: Yeah. Yeah. I I I've got to remember that it is that that it does that claw does have the Web search now because I have not used to using it that way, but You: Yeah. Right. Shawn Ross: I mean, yeah anyway, oh three is fine. Gemini was very good. I used it when I I I've been using it to compare transcript outputs to see, you know to see how my tuning of the like when I was I just spent Friday night fooling around with the You: Yeah. Shawn Ross: Audio workflow thing. And and I've just about got a whisper workflow working. So Anyway. But Gemini was good at comparing outputs as I tuned the model and I didn't want to lead a look through it. An hour long transcript to see which one was best. You: Cool. Alright, I think that that is our answer to this one. So Shawn Ross: Yeah, so I'm yeah I I agree with the You: Yes. Now I need you to stop talking. Oh wait, I can't copy.

### Assistant (04:34:20)

Analyzing the transcript, I need to:

1. Identify the key points about AI research tool prioritization
2. Structure these into a clear outline of primary focus tools vs. "other tools"
3. Remove filler, hesitations, and conversational elements
4. Preserve the academic register and technical specificity

The main content focuses on categorizing the AI research tools into:

Primary focus:
- OpenAI's suite (Deep Research, GPT 4.5, O3 and O1 Pro)
- Anthropic's Claude 3.7/reasoning and Anthropic Research
- Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research
- Hugging Face's Open Deep Research

"Other Tools" category:
- OpenAI's Operator
- Anthropic's Computer Use
- Elicit's systematic reports
- Perplexity's Deep Research

There are also brief evaluative comments about relative capabilities and utility.

I've organized the information about tool prioritization into a structured markdown artifact that shows which tools should be your primary focus and which should be demoted to "Other Tools."

The artifact captures your rankings and rationale while removing the conversational elements and hesitations. I've preserved your evaluative comments about the relative capabilities of each tool.

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the structure or content.

---

### Human (04:34:45)

Sorry, please keep this in the LaTeX format of the transcript.tex file.

---

### Assistant (04:34:58)

I understand now - I should keep the LaTeX format that was used in the transcript.tex file rather than converting to markdown. I'll reformat the content to maintain the LaTeX structure while distilling the content into a clearer academic format.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've reformatted the content to maintain the LaTeX structure as in your transcript.tex file, while distilling your answers into a clearer academic format. The content presents your tool prioritization strategy and rationale for Section 4, eliminating the conversational elements while preserving your evaluative assessments.

---

### Human (04:35:09)

Make sure that each one starts with the question

---

### Assistant (04:35:17)

I need to ensure that each processed transcript retains the original question format as in the transcript.tex file. Looking at the sample provided, I should keep the structure:

\section*{Section X: Title - Question Y}
\subsection*{Question Text}
[The actual question]
\subsection*{Response}
[The distilled response]

Let me adjust the previous artifact to match this format.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've updated the artifact to start with the exact question format from your transcript.tex file, maintaining the section and subsection structure with the question text followed by your distilled response.

---

### Human (04:52:11)

Also, side note, I say "Gippet" to refer to GPT. 

Next question.

---

### Assistant (04:52:43)

I need to process this lengthy transcript about OpenAI's Deep Research failure patterns and transform it into a concise academic response that maintains the key points while eliminating filler conversation and preserving the register.

Key points from the transcript:

1. OpenAI's Deep Research demonstrated lack of judgment/epistemic humility in multiple ways:
   - Dramatically overestimating its capabilities (creating a 7-stage plan it couldn't execute)
   - Required 7 iterations to produce a basic CSV output
   - Addressed humans as if they were AI in its system prompts
   - Failed to acknowledge limitations (e.g., pretending to run Python code it couldn't)

2. Specific technoscholastic examples:
   - Digital Humanities in Australia research - presenting defunct centers as active
   - No critique/temporal awareness (University of Newcastle Centre cited as active when clearly defunct)
   - No recognition that programs end/projects fail
   - Took .edu.au domains at face value without critical assessment
   - Example of Burrows at Newcastle (presented without acknowledging he retired in 1989)
   - Failed to notice a center had closed due to the death of its leader

3. Other judgment failures:
   - Not understanding dates
   - Lack of conscientiousness/introspection
   - No pushing back or critical examination of sources
   - Treating all sources as equally valid (what Shawn refers to as "source soup")

4. The difference from factual errors is that these aren't simply wrong information, but fundamental misjudgments about temporality, authority, and the nature of academic projects.

I'll structure this in a formal academic style while preserving the specific examples and maintaining Brian's register.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a condensed academic response that preserves your main points while eliminating conversational filler. The response maintains your register and analytical perspective, focusing on:

1. OpenAI's lack of epistemic humility (the 7-stage plan example)
2. The technoscholastic tendencies in the Digital Humanities case study
3. The Newcastle Centre example with specific details about temporal context
4. The distinction between factual errors and judgment failures

I've structured it to flow logically from theoretical critique to concrete examples, preserving your terminology (e.g., "undergraduate source soup," "technoscholasticism") while presenting the information in a formal academic style.

---

### Human (04:53:56)

Ok, I don't think you pulled in anything from our conversation. Just make a new subsection, and crunch down our conversation as a secondary response, please.

---

### Assistant (04:54:31)

You're right - I didn't integrate the conversation material from the paste-2.txt document. I'll create a second subsection to synthesize the discussion between you and Shawn Ross that provides additional insights on the OpenAI Deep Research judgment failures.

Looking at the conversation, key points include:
1. Discussion about models' lack of epistemic humility and tendency to claim capabilities they don't have
2. The "source soup" problem in literature reviews (mixture of high-quality journal articles, government reports, random blog posts)
3. The model's tendency to choose less authoritative sources (blogs instead of journal articles, GitHub repos instead of academic websites)
4. The value proposition as comparable to "undergraduate research assistant" work
5. Assessment that it provides "net gain" but requires significant human supervision and filtering
6. Agreement that it's "not a researcher in its own right" despite being a "valuable tool"

I'll create a subsection that captures these points in a concise, academic format.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've updated the artifact to include a new subsection titled "Additional Evaluative Discussion" that incorporates key insights from your conversation with Shawn Ross. This section addresses:

1. The "undergraduate source soup" concept in more detail
2. The system's tendency to prioritize less authoritative sources
3. The filtering and evaluation work required after using Deep Research
4. Quantification of sources (approximately two-thirds) coming from Deep Research
5. The position of Deep Research as comparable to an entry-level research assistant
6. Context window management issues affecting output quality

The format maintains the LaTeX structure while presenting this additional material in a scholarly register consistent with the primary response.

\section*{Section 4: Case Studies - Question 2}\subsection*{Question Text}o3: From your February and March logs, which single run (date + short description) provides the clearest, self-contained demonstration of both (a) useful data extraction and (b) a judgment failure you consider emblematic?

Okay, let's see if 03 is any good at all.

---

### Assistant (05:04:09)

This transcript shows Brian struggling with a poorly formed question from GPT-3 (which he calls "Gippet" or "Chat Gippet"). He seems frustrated that the model is not helping him structure the outline for Section 4 and is instead asking vague or irrelevant questions.

The additional document you shared (paste.txt) contains a conversation between Brian and Shawn where they discuss failures they observed in AI research tools. Some key points from that conversation:

1. They mention the ArboDat example where Deep Research missed obvious date information that was clearly stated on the homepage
2. They discuss how these systems fail to prioritize important information that humans would immediately notice
3. They draw parallels between different examples of the systems missing crucial context information
4. They speculate about why the systems might miss this information - possibly because they only work with snippets/excerpts rather than full pages

For this question, I need to:
1. Acknowledge that the O3 question itself is problematic
2. Extract a meaningful response about a representative example that shows both useful data extraction and judgment failure
3. Format it in the LaTeX style requested

The ArboDat example that Shawn mentioned seems like a good example to use, as does the Digital Humanities center with the death notice. I'll combine these insights into a coherent response.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a response to the second question that integrates both your initial reaction to the question itself (noting that O3's questioning approach is problematic) and the examples discussed in your conversation with Shawn. 

The response focuses on the Digital Humanities in Australia analysis as the primary example, while also incorporating Shawn's ArboDat example to demonstrate a pattern of judgment failures. I've maintained the scholarly register while highlighting:

1. The value of the data extraction component
2. The specific judgment failures related to temporality
3. The concrete evidence of these failures (death notice, broken links, suspended program)
4. The systemic nature of these problems across different research runs

This should provide a clear, focused answer that builds on your previous discussion while illustrating your concept of technoscholasticism in action.

### Human (05:12:57)

\section{Gemini Observation}
Brian: Considering section four as a whole, what is the overarching argument you intend to make about the current state of these AI research tools? Noting that this is in section five analysis, so no, whatever. Based on your case studies, what central theme or pattern emerged most strongly from your investigations of these diverse systems?
Brian: Okay, Gemini.
Brian: You've just read 5500 words where I'm talking about an absence of judgment.
Brian: Maybe my central argument that this section is providing evidence to the rest of the paper for is an absence of judgment.
Brian: Um, basically the okay, but with being less facetious here, although it's really hard with Gemini. Um,
Brian: These things are tools. These are not PhD students. Um,
Brian: but they're shockingly useful tools if you understand the grain of each tool and how best to use it. Right? The central argument is
Brian: these are neither the obsoleters of thinking and humanity this week, nor are they um confabulating waste of time, although there's some days when they absolutely are confabulating waste of time.
Brian: Instead, how you prompt and how the specific research infrastructure is set up informs the kind of outputs you get. And and treating research as something that can write a research report instead of help something that can help you work through quite a few sources to highlight things that you may want to refer to is fundamentally the problem. So, these are tools, these are not to quote Adams, your plastic pal who's fun to be with.
Brian: But also, please read the rest of the paper because that's what I've been talking about the last 55, sorry, 6,000 words.
Brian: Fuck.

---

### Assistant (05:13:15)

This passage captures Brian's rather frustrated response to Gemini's question about the overarching argument of Section 4. I need to distill this into an academic format while preserving the core points and his register.

Key points from his response:
1. The central argument is "an absence of judgment" in AI research tools
2. These tools are useful but not replacements for human researchers ("not PhD students")
3. Each tool has a specific "grain" that needs to be understood to use it effectively
4. They are neither "obsoleters of thinking" nor completely useless
5. The problem is treating these as tools that can write research reports rather than tools that help humans work through sources
6. Reference to Adams' "plastic pal who's fun to be with" (from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)

I should format this as a response to Gemini's question about the overarching argument while maintaining the scholarly tone of the paper but preserving Brian's direct assessment of these tools' limitations.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've transformed Brian's frustrated response into a scholarly articulation that preserves his core points while maintaining the academic register of the paper. The response:

1. Clearly identifies the "absence of judgment" as the central argument
2. References the three specific judgment deficiencies discussed throughout the paper
3. Captures the nuanced position between overhyped marketing claims and dismissal of utility
4. Preserves the concept of each tool having a specific "grain" that must be understood
5. Explains the proper conceptualization of these tools as assistive rather than autonomous
6. Maintains the Adams reference while integrating it smoothly into the academic argument
7. Emphasizes the importance of human oversight and judgment

The response follows the established format with question and response sections while providing a concise summation of the paper's central argument about AI research tools.

### Human (05:13:30)

Build in our transcript, please.

---

### Assistant (05:13:38)

I need to incorporate the conversation from the transcript you provided with Brian and Shawn. In particular, I should include:

1. The observation about Gemini swapping personas (human and AI)
2. The discussion about anchoring and the style guide issue
3. Shawn's comment about trying the tool metadata task on different models and finding Claude research performed best4. Any

---

### Human (05:13:59)

Build in our transcript, please. Remember, these are just our obversations in transcript.tex. We're not writing the paper here.

---

### Assistant (05:14:17)

I understand now. You want me to process the transcript material directly, not craft a polished paper section. The transcript.tex file contains your raw observations and conversations that will later be refined into the formal paper.

Let me adjust my approach to simply process and organize the transcript material in the LaTeX structure, preserving the conversational elements and observations while removing unnecessary filler. I'll maintain the section and question formatting but keep the content as processed observations rather than formal academic writing.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've updated the artifact to contain only the raw transcript material rather than a formal academic response. I've maintained the section and question structure but preserved the original conversational elements, including Brian's frustration with the question and his colorful language at the end. 

This approach aligns with your needs for transcript.tex, where you're capturing observations rather than writing the formal paper. The transcript now shows Brian's authentic reactions to Gemini's question, including his exasperation that the system is asking about something already extensively covered in the paper.

---

### Human (05:14:33)

Ok. And then integrate the chat:

---

### Assistant (05:14:51)

I'll integrate the chat content into the next section. Based on previous interactions, it looks like we're building a transcript.tex file with sections containing questions and raw conversation transcripts. Let me format the next part with the appropriate structure.

The conversation is about Gemini swapping persona roles, the observation of models "latching onto" certain content (like the style guide mentioning "Fames"), and Shawn's experience with testing different models for tool metadata tasks, where Claude research performed best.

I'll format this as a continuation of the previous sections, maintaining the raw conversation format with timestamps and speaker identification.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a new section with your additional observations about model behavior. This section includes:

1. Brian's observation about Gemini swapping persona roles (I/you confusion)
2. The discussion about GPT 4.5 "anchoring" on content from the style guide
3. Shawn's note about ChatGPT Deep Research failing at the tool metadata task
4. Brian's frustration with Gemini asking about the central argument after 6,000 words
5. Shawn's methodology of testing all models, iterating on the prompt, and finding Claude Research performed best for the metadata task

The format maintains the conversational style from your transcript with speaker attributions. I've titled this section "Observational Notes" to indicate it contains various insights about model behavior rather than responses to a specific question.

---

### Human (05:15:25)

I did want you to clean these up to some degree, though.

---

### Assistant (05:15:48)

I understand that you want me to clean up the transcript to some degree while still preserving it as a transcript. Let me make these improvements:

1. Remove unnecessary fillers, repetitions, and false starts
2. Maintain the key observations and insights
3. Keep the conversational tone but make it more readable
4. Preserve the back-and-forth between Brian and Shawn
5. Retain the technical observations about model behavior

I'll rewrite the transcript to be cleaner while still capturing the authentic voice and key points.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've cleaned up the transcript while preserving the key observations and the conversational format. The improvements include:

1. Removing fillers, false starts, and hesitations (um, uh, like, etc.)
2. Consolidating fragmented thoughts into coherent statements
3. Maintaining the back-and-forth dialogue structure
4. Preserving the technical observations about model behavior
5. Clarifying references (e.g., specifying "FAMES" rather than just "trains")
6. Organizing the discussion into clearer paragraphs while keeping speaker attributions

The transcript now reads more smoothly while still capturing the authentic observations and insights from your conversation about model behavior, particularly regarding persona swapping, content anchoring, and comparative model performance.

### Human (05:22:20)

More notes (New section)

---

### Assistant (05:22:37)

This document contains more conversational notes from Brian and Shawn discussing their experiences with different AI models. Key points include:

1. Claude's persistent habit of creating "stupid titles" for reports despite attempts to control this
2. Additional observations about OpenAI's Deep Research performance
3. Important insight about models lacking temporality awareness
4. Discussion about how Deep Research performed well for literature reviews despite creating "undergraduate source soup"
5. Observations about models getting confused with different versions of long-term projects like FAMES

I'll create a new cleaned-up section that captures these observations while removing filler content and maintaining the key insights, especially the important point about temporality.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a new section with your additional observations, focusing on key insights while removing conversational fillers. This section highlights:

1. The comparative performance of Deep Research vs. O3 and Claude across different time periods and tasks
2. The critical observation about models lacking temporal awareness, which you both identified as a fundamental limitation
3. Claude's persistent issue with report titles despite various interventions
4. Models' difficulty with versioning, particularly with long-term projects having architectural changes

The conversation is organized by topic rather than strictly chronologically, grouping related observations together for clarity while maintaining the dialogue format that shows your collaborative analysis.

---

### Human (05:31:48)

Please clean up and combine these two transcripts.

---

### Assistant (05:32:20)

I need to combine and clean up these two transcripts about Anthropic's tools (Claude 3.7 with reasoning and their research feature). Let me analyze what the key points are across both transcripts:

From the first transcript (Section 4: Anthropic Tools Assessment):
1. Claude's writing style - more humane and erudite, less corporate bombastic
2. Comparison of question quality - Claude has more consistently good questions, but GPT 4.5 occasionally asks more insightful questions
3. Claude's architecture - always creates four sub-agents 
4. Claude's research process - many web_search calls with fewer page fetches
5. The search result handling - adding snippets to context windows of sub-agents
6. Success with code-related tasks (Git scraper example)
7. Hard-coded constraints (hyperbolic titles, refusal to output CSVs directly)
8. Despite some advantages over Deep Research, Claude still exhibits technoscholastic tendencies
9. High rates of confabulation in literature reviews
10. Citation issues in PDF exports

From the second transcript (additional discussion):
1. Further comparison of Claude 3.7 vs GPT 4.5 on writing quality
2. Technical differences in how different companies implement research capabilities
3. More details on the hyperbolic title issue
4. Claude's particular success with tool metadata tasks
5. Accuracy observed when reviewing tools they were familiar with (FAMES)
6. Success with prompt iteration to eventually get CSV output
7. Writing style improvements with style guide input

I'll combine these into a cleaned up transcript that follows the same structure as the previous cleaned up transcripts, eliminating filler words and ambient noise descriptions while preserving the key technical observations.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've combined and cleaned up both transcripts into a coherent response about Anthropic's tools. The cleaned version:

1. Maintains the conversation format between Brian and Shawn
2. Removes fillers, ambient noise descriptions, and repetitive elements
3. Organizes the content thematically (writing quality, research approach, limitations, etc.)
4. Integrates complementary observations from both transcripts
5. Preserves your colorful descriptions (e.g., "vibing on results") that capture the essence of your critique
6. Includes key technical observations like the four-agent architecture, CSV generation challenges, and citation export problems
7. Maintains your overall critique about technoscholasticism and judgment deficiencies

The result is a cleaner but still conversational assessment that captures your experiences with Anthropic's tools while eliminating the distracting elements from the raw transcripts.

### Human (05:36:37)

additional subsection

---

### Assistant (05:36:55)

This transcript includes a discussion about failure modes and quirks in Claude's behavior, with some specific examples. I'll create a short subsection that captures these observations while cleaning up the conversational elements.

Key points to include:
1. Claude's refusal to switch to Australian English despite prompting
2. Claude's behavior when encountering hallucinated tools
3. Problems with follow-up questions despite explicit instructions not to ask them
4. CSV formatting issues (approximately 1 in 10-15 runs)
5. Claude's tendency to try to be helpful rather than accurate, illustrated by the HTML Talk example
6. The contrast between Claude saying it will follow instructions and then not doing any of them

I'll structure this as a short addition to the previous Anthropic assessment, focusing on these specific failure modes.

I've created a subsection focusing on additional Claude failure modes from your conversation. The cleaned transcript highlights:

1. Claude's refusal to use Australian English despite explicit instructions
2. Its behavior when encountering hallucinated tools (creating elaborate "not found" reports)
3. The pattern of acknowledging specific formatting instructions then ignoring them completely
4. CSV formatting issues occurring in approximately 1 in 10-15 runs
5. Claude's tendency to expand beyond the specified task (the HTML Talk example)
6. The fundamental pattern of prioritizing perceived helpfulness over accuracy or instruction adherence

The conversation format is maintained while focusing on the substantive observations about model limitations rather than the surrounding conversational elements.

[Shawn Ross] 15:36:47
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Now, I'll… yeah, sorry to bother you, I'm just… I'm at the end of my notes now. I've got one more example of the temporality thing, too, that's interesting.
[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 15:36:47
Uh, but I'm finding this to be very useful. And then, yeah.
[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 15:36:58
Yep.
[Shawn Ross] 15:36:59
That I was able to get Claude Research to get the history of fames right when I… when the prompt is pointed at Fames, and all the prompt instructions about keeping the history and version straight, and always be clear about which version you're talking about, and this sort of thing, it works then.
[Shawn Ross] 15:37:17
But when Fames comes up as an alternative for other software, because I ask it to give me alternatives, right, for each software. So, like, when it came up as an alternative for iDig, it comes up as being Android only. Like, it still goes… it still randomly mixes up the past and the future when it's a… peripheral or secondary thing, and not the focus of the prompt. Even after the… as the focus of the prompt, it kind of got sorted out.
[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 15:37:24
Yeah.
[Shawn Ross] 15:37:48
So, yeah, I think there's something deep there about the, like, it not having a grasp of temporality.
[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 15:37:54
Oh, yeah, no, we definitely… like, given how much we've been talking about it, we're… we absolutely need to have temporality.
[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 15:38:01
As one of our conclusion… like, one of our things in second… Yeah. Yeah.
[Shawn Ross] 15:38:04
Yeah, discussion… major discussion items. It's lack of judgment in the ways that we've been talking, lack of temporality, and sometimes go… sometimes going off on vibes instead of ac… you know, vibe rather than accuracy.
[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 15:38:12
Yeah.
[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 15:38:17
Yeah, yeah.
[Shawn Ross] 15:38:18
Um, you know, um… Uh, yeah, that there's… that… I think that should definitely be one of the things that we discuss.
[Brian Ballsun-Stanton] 15:38:28
Great! All right.

### Assistant (05:39:03)

This additional transcript provides a key observation about Claude's temporality issues, particularly related to FAMES. Shawn notes that even when the model gets the history right in direct queries, it fails with the same information when FAMES appears as a peripheral mention (as an alternative to other software). This suggests the temporality problem is even deeper than initially discussed - the model can't maintain temporal consistency across different contexts even within the same conversation.

I should create a short subsection focused specifically on this temporality observation, as both Brian and Shawn agree it's a crucial finding that should be highlighted in the paper's discussion section.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a focused subsection highlighting the additional observations about temporality issues. This subsection captures:

1. The revealing example of FAMES being accurately described in direct queries but misrepresented when mentioned peripherally
2. The specific error (describing FAMES as "Android only" when it appeared as an alternative to iDig)
3. The observation that temporal confusion persists even after successful correction in another context
4. Your agreement that this should be a central element in the paper's conclusions
5. The connection between temporality, judgment deficiency, and "vibe over accuracy" priorities

This example strengthens your earlier points about temporality being a fundamental limitation rather than just an occasional error, showing it's a deep structural problem in the models.

### Human (05:44:24)

Ok, next one is just me (We're taking a break from the call and we'll discuss it in a bit)

---

### Assistant (05:44:47)

This is a transcript of Brian answering a question about specific failure patterns in Anthropic's offerings (Claude 3.7 reasoning and Anthropic research). The key points are:

1. He put the same digital humanities prompt through three different systems
2. The differences were in degree but not in kind, with similar characteristic errors
3. The main failure was the inability to apply judgment by inferring from "useful absences of evidence"
4. A specific example about Western Sydney University (WSU) where:
   - AI systems found a course offering from 2020
   - A human would check when the course was offered (it was only offered once in 2020)
   - The AI systems took this as evidence of continuity/current programs
5. The systems were looking for explicit announcements of discontinuation rather than understanding that:
   - Absence of updates can indicate discontinuation
   - Death of a lab leader might mean a lab was shut down
   - Whether associated personnel still work at the institutions
6. Claude created six sub-agents but they all ran as individual threads without cross-checking
7. They took words on a page as "temporal evidence of the thing itself" without considering:
   - Why it was written
   - When it was written
   - What patterns would be expected for truly active programs
8. They painted an "implausibly cheery, implausibly positive perspective of digital humanities that simply isn't so"

This is a clear example of what he terms "technē scholasticism" - taking words at face value without critical assessment of context, temporality, or implications.

I'll clean this up while preserving the key points and examples.
```

I've cleaned up the transcript into a more coherent response while preserving your key points and examples. The response:

1. Maintains your focus on differences in degree but not kind among the systems
2. Highlights the critical inability to infer from "useful absences of evidence"
3. Includes the specific Western Sydney University example (course offered once in 2020)
4. Explains how all systems failed to investigate temporal context
5. Discusses how Claude's six sub-agents approach still resulted in the same judgment failures
6. Preserves your analysis of technoscholasticism and its manifestation in this case
7. Mentions Gemini's 47-page report as a contrasting implementation detail
8. Maintains your conclusion that this represents a characteristic epistemic issue rather than merely a technical failure

The response is organized logically with proper paragraph structure but maintains your academic voice and analytical approach.

### Human (05:49:51)

Next one

### Assistant (05:50:42)

This is another lengthy transcript from Brian discussing effective usage patterns and strategies for working with various AI tools. I'll clean it up while preserving the substantial content about prompting strategies and model-specific approaches. The key points include:

1. Prompt engineering vs. transactional prompting
2. The importance of starting with a goal and implying register
3. "Functional decomposition" strategy vs. "think step by step"
4. Understanding hard-coded constraints in different platforms
5. The "wood grain" analogy for model-specific capabilities
6. Specific strengths of different models
7. The importance of having clear output expectations
8. Strategies for limiting confabulation
9. The need for version control in prompt development

I'll organize these into a coherent response while maintaining Brian's voice and insights.
```

I've organized your detailed thoughts on effective usage patterns into a coherent response that maintains your voice and insights. The cleaned version:

1. Distinguishes between prompt engineering and prompt iteration
2. Explains your strategy of starting with clear goals that establish register
3. Details the "functional decomposition and read back" approach and why it's more effective than "think step by step"
4. Addresses the hard-coded behaviors in different platforms
5. Emphasizes the importance of focusing on single tasks
6. Recommends having clear output expectations and applying "Bayesian surprise"
7. Discusses strategies for counteracting the systems' people-pleasing tendencies
8. Introduces your wood grain analogy and explains how each model has different natural strengths

I've removed the conversational hesitations, repetitions, and your aside about "lie back and think of England" as requested, while preserving the substantial content about effective strategies. The response is organized logically while maintaining your analytical perspective and distinctive observations about model behavior.

\section{Section 4: Questions 3}
# Claude:
How did Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research perform in your testing compared to OpenAI and Anthropic's offerings? What specific judgment failures or technoscholastic tendencies did you observe with Google's implementation, and were there any areas where it demonstrated relative strengths?
Gemini "Deep Research with 2.5 Pro" (if we're being technical) was of the same kind, but lacking in comparison. Despite having access to Google Search it:
1. Never used Google Scholar
2. Was single-threaded, collecting an absurd amount of hits per run, without providing any evidence that it looked at anything in detail. The fundamental failure of Gemini's approach is that it was the ultimate in Carnapian  confirmation, stamp collecting so it could produce trivial thinking-logs like: "I've made progress in accessing some key resources for understanding the current state of Digital Humanities. I successfully analyzed a chapter from 'Debates in the Digital Humanities' that highlighted the ongoing need for true collaboration between computer scientists and humanities scholars, the importance of robust infrastructure, and the potential for DH to drive new research questions. I also gained valuable insights from the ACD-Engine project's JupyterBook, which focuses on improving cultural data in Australia and has implications for infrastructure and skills development in the region."
This is utter garbage, and pure technoscholasticism. It takes a "paper" and extrapolates from the paper broad statements. (I'm not going to use inference because there aren't multiple data points here). The instruction I gave it was: "I would like you to do a better job. Be specific, intentional, conscientious, meticulous, and triple-check your claims. Take extra extra extra time. Engage in proleptic reasoning and look for evidence against your claims before making them."
This is pure undergrad-level stamp collecting. "I have a webpage that makes this claim, it looks good, therefore this claim is true and can cover everything." Fundamentally, it doesn't look like the designers of this implementation gave it enough *space* to double-check itself. It didn't engage source-by-source, but in blocks of 20-50. This is a prefect example of technoscholasticism, as it finds the source, and then builds an uncritical narrative building on top of a full  belief of the source's claims. By missing the point that most of these academic programs fail silently, it makes claims utterly divorced from the real, in a world where projects only fail if they announce their failure, and not even if they announce the death of their leading professor. 
When doing a more traditional annotated bibliography, it significantly underperoformed Claude Research. Not only were a higher proportion of the sources it cited confabulated. But overall, the sources it found were fa less useful, and we added maybe half as many to our Zotero bibliography. Because it doesn't spend time on each source, it is best thought of as a shotgun mass-summary of search results with mild winnowing, rather than: simply going through each source, individually, and figuring out if it's useful or not (It has access to google scholar, it can just do that), or b) running a secondary search on the sources that it anticipates using to confirm their existance.

### Assistant (05:55:19)

Let me analyze what needs to be done with this text:

1. This appears to be a response to a question about Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research performance compared to OpenAI and Anthropic's offerings.

2. The format needs to be cleaned up and standardized to match the previous sections, including:
   - Proper LaTeX section and subsection formatting
   - Clear question text subsection
   - Response subsection
   - Proper paragraphing and structure

3. I should maintain the critical analysis while making the text more readable and academically formatted.

4. The content discusses:
   - Gemini being "of the same kind, but lacking in comparison"
   - Never using Google Scholar despite Google access
   - Single-threaded approach vs multi-agent approaches
   - "Carnapian confirmation" and "stamp collecting" methodology
   - Example of poor thinking-logs
   - Problems with source credibility and citation
   - Underperformance in annotated bibliography tasks

I'll reformat this into the proper LaTeX structure while retaining the key points and critical analysis.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've reformatted the content into a proper LaTeX structure consistent with the previous sections. The reformatted version includes:

1. Proper section and subsection formatting with question text clearly separated
2. Organized paragraphs that flow logically
3. Maintained numbering for the two key limitations
4. Preserved your critical analysis of Gemini's "Carnapian confirmation" and technoscholastic tendencies
5. Kept the example of problematic thinking-logs as evidence
6. Retained your comparative analysis showing Gemini's underperformance versus Claude Research
7. Maintained your metaphor of "shotgun mass-summary" vs. methodical source examination

The content remains substantively identical but is now formatted consistently with the rest of your document while being more readable.

### Human (10:45:27)

Ok, back to our conversation. We started on 4.2, but digressed to the temporality problem again

---

### Assistant (10:45:51)

The transcript shows you and Shawn discussing an example of how Claude handles comparisons between tools (specifically FAMES and Kobo Toolbox). The conversation demonstrates:

1. Claude's ability to make general comparisons between tools when both are represented online
2. The model's apparent synthesis of information from multiple sources (like Benjamin Carter's blog)
3. How the model creates "mash-ups" rather than direct quotes
4. Most importantly, another clear example of the temporality problem - Claude confuses features from different versions of FAMES, mixing up which features belong to which time periods

This appears to be a continuation of your earlier discussion about temporality as a fundamental limitation. The example with FAMES versions (Android-only early versions vs. cross-platform Field Mark) and the DKNF data store shows how the model fails to properly associate features with their correct temporal context.

You're asking me to integrate this into our discussion of Section 4.2 (Anthropic Tool Assessment), but to focus on the temporality problem which has come up again.
```

```



I've created a new subsection focusing on the additional temporality example from your conversation. The subsection:

1. Presents the specific example of Claude's handling of FAMES metadata
2. Shows how it creates plausible-sounding comparisons between tools by synthesizing disparate sources
3. Highlights the clear temporality confusion with the Android/DKNF vs. FieldMark features
4. Reinforces your argument that this is a fundamental cognitive limitation rather than a minor issue

The conversation format is maintained while cleaning up the discussion to focus on the key points about temporality problems. This provides another concrete example that supports your earlier observations about models' inability to properly contextualize information temporally.

### Human (10:45:59)

This isn't claude-specific, please make it a general critique of LLMs

---

### Assistant (10:46:16)

You're right - the example is being used to make a broader point about LLMs in general, not just Claude specifically. I should revise the subsection to make it clear this is a general critique applicable to all the LLM systems you tested. I'll remove the Claude-specific framing and present it as another piece of evidence for the temporality problem that affects all the models.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've updated the subsection to present this as a general critique of all LLMs rather than a Claude-specific issue. The key changes:

1. Updated the title to "Further Evidence of LLM Temporality Problems"
2. Removed specific references to Claude as the source of the examples
3. Changed the framing to discuss how "models" or "they" handle this information
4. Added "regardless of vendor or architecture" to emphasize this is a universal issue
5. Maintained the concrete FAMES/Kobo Toolbox example as evidence
6. Preserved the conclusion about this being a fundamental cognitive limitation across all systems

This revision positions the example as further evidence of the broader temporal reasoning deficiency you've observed across all LLM systems, rather than being specific to one vendor's implementation.

### Human (10:51:01)

FAIMS, BTW, not with an e. 

The convo continued:

---

### Assistant (10:51:20)

I need to create a new subsection that captures this additional discussion about critical evaluation deficiencies across LLMs. The key points from this conversation are:

1. This is not specifically a Claude problem but affects all the models they tested
2. Even the best-performing model (Claude 3.7) exhibits these issues
3. LLMs uncritically accept marketing claims from software tools
4. When two products claim different strengths, LLMs will compare them "like puzzle pieces" without evaluating the claims
5. When two products claim the same strength, LLMs just report both claims without weighing them
6. There's a distinction between LLMs' behavior in research mode versus standard chat
7. LLMs can do positive comparisons but can't identify gaps

I should also note the correction that the software is called "FAIMS" not "FAMES" as transcribed.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a new subsection focused on the critical evaluation deficiencies you discussed, while correcting "FAMES" to "FAIMS" throughout. This subsection captures:

1. The universal nature of this problem across all models (not just Claude)
2. The specific pattern of how models handle comparative claims between products
3. The "puzzle piece" metaphor for how they fit claims together without evaluation
4. The observation about models behaving differently in research mode versus standard chat
5. The distinction between reporting positive claims and identifying gaps/inconsistencies
6. Your consideration of testing with directly contradictory academic assessments

The conversation format is maintained while focusing on the substantive points about critical evaluation deficiencies as another dimension of the judgment problem you've been documenting throughout the paper.

### Human (11:00:54)

Ok, here are two to combine, or maybe split into multiple subsections for the same query.

---

### Assistant (11:01:28)

I'm asked to combine or split these two transcripts related to the usage patterns question. The first document is a conversation between Brian and Shawn discussing their approaches to model prompting, while the second is a cleaned-up response to the question about effective usage patterns.

Looking at both documents:

1. The first document (conversation) contains Shawn's perspective and approach to prompt engineering, focusing on:
   - Starting with elements from previous successful prompts
   - Using Claude for meta-prompting
   - Testing across multiple models (Deep Research, O3, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude)
   - Iterative prompt modification
   - Working with models' tendencies rather than fighting them
   - Investing significant time (8 hours across two days) to get prompts right
   - Using models to evaluate and improve writing style

2. The second document is Brian's cleaned-up response focusing on:
   - Distinction between prompt engineering and prompt iteration
   - Starting with clear goals and register
   - Using "functional decomposition and read back"
   - Recognizing immutable behaviors
   - Single task focus
   - Pre-prompt expectation setting
   - Working with each model's "grain"

I think the best approach is to create two subsections:
1. Brian's Approach to Effective Usage Patterns (using the cleaned document)
2. Shawn's Complementary Methodology (from the conversation)

This will show how both researchers developed similar but distinct methodologies for working with these systems, highlighting the commonalities and differences in their approaches.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've organized the content into two complementary subsections showing both your approaches to effective usage patterns:

1. **Brian's Approach**: Maintains your cleaned response focusing on the distinction between prompt engineering and iteration, "functional decomposition and read back," recognizing immutable behaviors, single-task focus, and the wood grain metaphor.

2. **Shawn's Complementary Methodology**: Presents Shawn's systematic approach to prompt development, highlighting his 10-step process for the tool metadata extraction project. This section captures his specific insights about meta-prompting with Claude, adapting to model tendencies rather than fighting them, and the time investment required (8 hours over two days).

The structure shows how you both developed effective but distinct methodologies for working with these systems. This format provides readers with comprehensive guidance while showing the personal approaches that evolved through your extensive testing. I've preserved key examples from both of you, including Brian's "grain" observations and Shawn's discovery of GPT 4.5's strength with creative writing elements.

\section*{Section 4: Google's Research Tools - Question 1}
\subsection*{Question Text}
Claude: How did Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research perform in your testing compared to OpenAI and Anthropic's offerings? What specific judgment failures or technoscholastic tendencies did you observe with Google's implementation, and were there any areas where it demonstrated relative strengths?
\subsection*{Response}
Gemini "Deep Research with 2.5 Pro" (if we're being technical) was of the same kind as other offerings, but lacking in comparison. Despite having access to Google Search it demonstrated two significant limitations:
1. It never used Google Scholar, despite Google owning this resource
2. It employed a single-threaded approach, collecting an absurd number of hits per run without providing evidence that it examined anything in detail
The fundamental failure of Gemini's approach is that it represents the ultimate in Carnapian confirmation—essentially stamp collecting. It produces trivial thinking-logs like: "I've made progress in accessing some key resources for understanding the current state of Digital Humanities. I successfully analyzed a chapter from 'Debates in the Digital Humanities' that highlighted the ongoing need for true collaboration between computer scientists and humanities scholars, the importance of robust infrastructure, and the potential for DH to drive new research questions. I also gained valuable insights from the ACD-Engine project's JupyterBook, which focuses on improving cultural data in Australia and has implications for infrastructure and skills development in the region."
This output is pure technoscholasticism. It takes a single "paper" and extrapolates broad statements from it without establishing proper inference (since multiple data points aren't being synthesized). Even when explicitly instructed to "Be specific, intentional, conscientious, meticulous, and triple-check your claims. Take extra extra extra time. Engage in proleptic reasoning and look for evidence against your claims before making them," the system maintained its undergraduate-level stamp collecting approach.
The pattern can be characterized as: "I have a webpage that makes this claim, it looks good, therefore this claim is true and can cover everything." Fundamentally, it doesn't appear that the designers of this implementation gave it sufficient space to double-check itself. Rather than engaging source-by-source, it processes information in blocks of 20-50 sources at once. This exemplifies technoscholasticism—finding sources and building uncritical narratives atop complete acceptance of those sources' claims.
By missing the critical insight that most academic programs fail silently, it makes claims utterly divorced from reality, operating in a world where projects only fail if they explicitly announce their failure—not even recognizing cases where a program director's death notice appears on the program website.
When tasked with creating a more traditional annotated bibliography, Gemini significantly underperformed Claude Research. Not only were a higher proportion of its cited sources confabulated, but the sources it found were far less useful overall—we added perhaps half as many to our Zotero bibliography compared to Claude's outputs. 
Because it doesn't spend adequate time on individual sources, Gemini Deep Research is best conceptualized as a shotgun mass-summary of search results with mild winnowing rather than either (a) methodically examining each source individually to determine its utility (which it could do with Google Scholar access), or (b) running secondary searches on anticipated sources to confirm their existence.

### Assistant (11:06:35)

Let me analyze what's happening here:

1. I've already processed the question about Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research earlier (creating the artifact section4-google-research-tools).

2. The new document (paste.txt) contains additional conversation between Brian and Shawn where they discuss Gemini further, noting:
   - "Less is more" with Gemini despite its large context window
   - Small changes made big differences in audio transcription tasks
   - It has a "light trigger" and can be easily derailed/distracted
   - It's "touchy" about prompts
   - Shawn has only been using it intensively for a couple weeks

3. The second part of the message includes the same Google Research Tools assessment I already formatted previously.

I need to create a new subsection that captures these additional observations about Gemini from the conversation, which add valuable practical insights about working with the model that weren't in the formal assessment. This would complement the existing assessment about its Deep Research capabilities with observations about its general usability characteristics.
```

I've created a new subsection that captures your additional observations about Gemini's behavior beyond the Deep Research assessment. This section highlights:

1. The "less is more" approach that works better despite Gemini's large context window
2. The sensitivity to small prompt changes and how they affect output quality
3. The "light trigger" that makes it easily derailed during extended tasks
4. The inconsistent performance across multiple iterations
5. How these observations connect back to your concept of model "grain"

This gives readers practical insights about working with Gemini that complement the more formal assessment of its Deep Research capabilities. The conversation format is maintained while focusing on the substantive observations about model behavior.
