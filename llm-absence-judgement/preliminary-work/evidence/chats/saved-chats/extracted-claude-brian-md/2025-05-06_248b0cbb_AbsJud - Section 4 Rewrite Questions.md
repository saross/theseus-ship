### Human (23:41:17)

I am on my phone, do you have access to the TeX files? They are not displaying.

I'm being asked to help transform transcribed audio inputs into an academic document. Let me check what I have available in the provided documents:

1. Document 1: "transcripts.tex" - This appears to be audio transcriptions of the user discussing various aspects of AI judgment, deep research, and related topics. These are dated February 2025. These transcripts contain important ideas and observations for their academic paper.

2. Document 2: "brian-references.bib" - This is a bibliography file containing academic references that can be used in the paper.

3. Document 3: "AbsenceJudgement.tex" - This appears to be a LaTeX file containing parts of an academic paper draft titled "An Absence of Judgment: AI's Limitations in Deep Research tasks"

4. Document 4: "WritingStyleGuide.md" - A style guide for the academic writing which outlines voice, tone, formatting preferences, etc.

The task is to help integrate the user's transcribed audio notes into an organized academic document. I should:
- Not be overly complimentary
- Apply critical thinking and common sense
- Raise potential issues rather than offer empty praise
- Create markdown outlines in artifacts when appropriate
- Transform the user's transcribed inputs into academic content
- Only ask questions if absolutely necessary for clarity

I should begin by acknowledging that I can see these documents, and then start organizing the content. The TeX files mentioned are displaying correctly for me, so I should assure the user of that and begin working with what I have.

Yes, I have access to all the documents you've shared. I can see:

1. A transcript file containing audio recordings from February 2025
2. A bibliography file (brian-references.bib)
3. A LaTeX draft paper titled "An Absence of Judgment: AI's Limitations in Deep Research tasks"
4. A writing style guide

I'll help transform your transcribed audio inputs into academic content for your paper. Let me start by creating an outline of the current document structure to help us identify where your transcribed content can best be integrated.

### Human (23:43:03)

Wonderful. I need to rework section 4. Specifically, the tools we want to talk about have changed, and we want to demote some of them to "other tools". 

Can you ask me a series of specific, pointed, questions that I can record my responses to to help me get my thinking started on the restructure and detailed provision of section 4, please?

---

### Assistant (23:43:15)


I need to craft specific questions about restructuring Section 4 (Case Studies of AI Research Tools). From the current outline, it appears that the section currently has 4 subsections:

1. OpenAI's Deep Research
2. Anthropic's Computer Use
3. Elicit Research Assistant
4. Additional Tools

The user wants to restructure this, demoting some tools to the "Other Tools" section. I should ask questions that help determine:

1. Which specific tools should be the focus
2. What level of detail is needed for each
3. What specific observed capabilities and limitations should be highlighted
4. How these observations connect to the paper's theoretical framework of judgment deficiency
5. How to structure the comparisons between tools
6. What evidence or examples from their testing should be included

I'll craft targeted questions to help the user think through these aspects.

Here are specific, pointed questions to help you restructure Section 4:

1. Which specific AI research tools should be your primary focus in Section 4, and which should be demoted to "Other Tools"?

2. For each primary tool you want to highlight, what were the most compelling examples of judgment deficiency you observed during testing?

3. What specific tasks did you attempt with each tool that best demonstrated the three dimensions of judgment deficiency (epistemic humility, induction, correspondence with reality)?

4. Can you describe a concrete instance where a tool appeared to be working systematically but actually demonstrated technoscholasticism?

5. Did any tools show partial capabilities in one dimension of judgment while completely failing in others? Which ones and how?

6. What were the most notable differences in how various tools handled contradictory information or uncertain knowledge?

7. Were there any unexpected successes where a tool showed glimmers of effective judgment? What were the limitations of these successes?

8. What specific evidence from your testing best illustrates the "mundane utility" of these tools despite their limitations?

9. How did the different tools compare in their handling of source evaluation and literature contextualization?

10. What specific suggestions for improvement emerged from your testing of each tool?

Ok. Question 1 Answer:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\begin{document}
\section*{Section 4: Outline Rejigger - Question 1}
\subsection*{Question Text}
Which specific AI research tools should be your primary focus in Section 4, and which should be demoted to "Other Tools"?
\subsection*{Transcription}
Okay, section four outline rejigger.
Uh, question one.
What specific AI research tools should be your primary focus in section four and which should be demoted to other tools?
Um, I'm sure Sean put something in the outline for this, but
the tools that offered um genuine pragmatic utility.
My goodness. Genuine are these whatever.
Um.
This is.
[cough]
The tools that offered specific pragmatic utility are OpenAI's suite of tools, specifically OpenAI Deep Research, OpenAI [Gippet / GPT] 4.5 and to a notably lesser degree um OpenAI's uh reasoning models of uh 03 and 01 Pro.
Ah, that's not right. I don't understand these why I am so. Okay. Um.
For Anthropic, the I don't know. Oh no no no no no. Oh no. Shoot.
[unclear] for this? I don't not for this?
Yeah, okay. These are supposed to be.
For Anthropic, uh Claude 37 uh slash reasoning, but also Anthropic research which dropped in this month, May, um has proven shockingly useful and is of the same kind, if slightly better degree than uh OpenAI's Deep Research.
We have uh Google's Gemini Pro 2503-25, although a new model just dropped today that I have to investigate.
Uh, but also um
what was it called?
Google Gemini Advanced Deep uh no. Google Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research.
May- I had put in a to-do for me to check if they call it Deep or not.
Um, which is
No, we need to speak to it even though it's crap because it's of the same kind if a lower degree than the other two. Um, specifically we need to speak to its
searching parameters.
Uh, then we need a small section on Hugging Face's Open Deep Research.
Then in other models we need or in other utilities, we need sub-subsections. Yes. Sub-subsections on
OpenAI's Operator, Anthropic's computer use, Elicit's systematic reports. Uh remind me to double check that one because we only got access to one of them, um and it may not be their systematic reports, whatever, it doesn't matter. It's true. Uh Perplexity's Deep Research.
Yes.
Um so all of those need to be in in the need to be in the smaller section. Or sub-subsection on other videos.
\end{document}

### Assistant (00:10:59)


The user has provided a detailed response to Question 1 about which AI research tools should be the primary focus in Section 4 and which should be demoted to "Other Tools". Let me analyze their response and organize it clearly.

Primary tools to focus on in Section 4:
1. OpenAI's suite of tools:
   - OpenAI Deep Research
   - OpenAI GPT 4.5
   - OpenAI's reasoning models (O3 and O1 Pro) - to a lesser degree

2. Anthropic tools:
   - Claude 3.7 (with reasoning)
   - Anthropic Research (released in May) - described as "shockingly useful" and slightly better than OpenAI's Deep Research

3. Google's tools:
   - Google Gemini Pro 2.5 (model 03-25)
   - Google Gemini Pro 2.5 Deep Research (needs to be included despite being "crap" because it's of the same kind, if lower degree)

4. Hugging Face's Open Deep Research

Tools to demote to "Other Tools" (as sub-subsections):
1. OpenAI's Operator
2. Anthropic's Computer Use
3. Elicit's systematic reports (user notes to double-check this)
4. Perplexity's Deep Research

I need to update the outline for Section 4 based on this information.

Based on your response, I'll update the outline for Section 4 to reflect your new structure.

### Human (05:17:09)

Ok, small corrections. Elicit Research Report, we didn't have access to the systematic review. Perplexity Research. 

I'm at my desk. I can record myself directly, rather than trying to do this in transit. Please consider the transcript and my goals and reorder/expand the question list above. Ask me one, specific, pointed, paper-relevant at a time so that we can rebuild the outline for this section. My intention for today is to figure out the claims abd sub-claims for each section/subsection/subsub.

---

### Assistant (05:17:16)


I see that you want to rebuild the outline for Section 4 of your paper in a more methodical way. You're looking for more focused, one-at-a-time questions that will help you articulate the claims and sub-claims for each tool category. Let me rethink the question list and start asking more targeted questions one by one.

You've made a couple of corrections:
1. "Elicit Research Report" (not "Systematic Reports")
2. "Perplexity Research" (not "Deep Research")

I'll start by asking a focused question about the first major tool category (OpenAI's Suite of Tools) to help build out the specific claims and sub-claims you want to make.

I'll ask you one focused question at a time to help build the claims and sub-claims for each section. Let's start with the first major tool category:

For OpenAI's suite of tools (Deep Research, GPT 4.5, and reasoning models O3/O1 Pro), what were the most significant judgment deficiencies you observed, and can you provide a specific example that demonstrates each deficiency?

### Human (05:50:56)

Ok, small corrections. Elicit Research Report, we didn't have access to the systematic review. Perplexity Research. 

Please render this into the format I have the section in in LaTeX, please. I'm about to start three new chats. Feel free to note open questions in the comments.

---

### Assistant (05:51:21)


The user wants me to format the updated Section 4 structure into LaTeX format that matches the existing document structure. I need to make two small corrections:
1. Change "Elicit's Systematic Reports" to "Elicit Research Report"
2. Change "Perplexity's Deep Research" to "Perplexity Research"

I'll create LaTeX code for Section 4 that follows the structure and style of the existing document. Based on the document I can see, sections use \section{} and subsections use \subsection{}, with possible \subsubsection{} for lower-level headings.

The user mentioned they're about to start three new chats, so I'll include any open questions as comments in the LaTeX code.
```

```



I've formatted Section 4 in LaTeX according to your document structure. I've noted a few open questions as comments that you can consider as you draft the detailed content.

Would you like me to ask the next question from the list for you to respond to? Or would you prefer to wait until you've started the other chats you mentioned?
