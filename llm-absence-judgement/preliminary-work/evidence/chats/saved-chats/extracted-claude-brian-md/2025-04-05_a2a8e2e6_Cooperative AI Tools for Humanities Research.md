Hi Claude. Can you crunch this down to a 100 word description, please?

 Here's a 100-word description of the document:

The Humanities AI Workbench project aims to develop tools fostering cooperative interactions between humanities researchers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Based on frameworks addressing "technoscholasticism" and "AI-Locus of Control," it preserves human agency while enhancing research capabilities. The Workbench supports all research phases—ideation, design, bibliographic research, dataset generation, software creation, analysis, and composition—through a modular architecture enabling model substitution. Developed in partnership with the Australian Research Data Commons, it emphasizes FAIR principles, transparent AI contributions, and qualitative benchmarking. The project addresses contextual understanding and multimodal capabilities while establishing new standards for transparent, reproducible AI-assisted humanities research.
