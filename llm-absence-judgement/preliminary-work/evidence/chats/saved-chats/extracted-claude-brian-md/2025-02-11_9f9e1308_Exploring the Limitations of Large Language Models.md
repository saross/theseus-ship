## Conversation

### Human (22:49:54)

Hi Claude. Here's a (low quality) transcript of a convo I had with ChatGPT. Please 1) remove all of its NOOP responses, 2) extract my text. 3) turn it into a rough outline

### Assistant (22:50:08)

 I'll help clean up and structure this transcript into a coherent outline. Let me extract just your statements and organize them thematically.

<antThinking>Since this is a structuring task that will be shared directly in our conversation, I should keep it in-line rather than creating an artifact. The key is to remove ChatGPT's repetitive acknowledgments and organize the scattered thoughts into a coherent outline.</antThinking>

# Rough Title: An Absence of Judgment

## Main Thesis
- Large language models are fundamentally incapable of judgment
- We must look at actions their words produce, not just the words themselves

## Deep Research and AI Capabilities
1. Current State
   - Uses O3 for research
   - Connected to Cohen's repost of DAKISH on why AI hasn't produced great research
   - Can mimic language of judgment without true judgment capability
   - Exhibits acceptable fluency and solid domain knowledge

2. Limitations
   - Lacks goal-setting and goal-following behavior
   - Still bound to the Next Token paradigm
   - Self-reflexive but limited to:
     - Running searches
     - Synthesizing information
   - Cannot truly judge if it has accomplished goals
     - Assumes goal completion at every output

3. Comparison to Human Researchers
   - First-week PhD student as prototypical target
   - Goal-following behavior is mimicked but fundamentally absent

## Practical Applications
1. Literature Reviews
   - Initial impressions were "quite impressive"
   - Used for preparing and collecting research-worthy datasets
   - Improvement over previous superficial literature reviews

## To-Do Notes
- Pull definition of "identic" from conversation with Brett

Gaps/Areas Needing Development:
1. Several incomplete thoughts/interruptions in the transcript
2. Missing elaboration on "The Normal Intuitive Pattern"
3. Unclear connection between "mundane utility" and tool-using behavior
4. Incomplete discussion of what makes an agent truly "agentic"
5. Missing concrete examples of how the lack of judgment manifests in research outputs

### Human (23:12:21)

Ah, sorry, turn this into TeX please.

### Assistant (23:12:40)

 I'll create a LaTeX document structure for your outline.

<antThinking>This needs proper LaTeX formatting including sections and subsections, and should be created as an artifact since it's a complete document that may need future revisions.</antThinking>
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a LaTeX document that structures your outline. The document includes:

1. Proper LaTeX document class and necessary packages
2. Clear hierarchical structure using sections and subsections
3. Itemized lists for detailed points
4. Placeholder for title page (author can be added)

Would you like me to modify any part of the structure or add additional sections?
