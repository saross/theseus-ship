### Human (02:03:25)

Hi Claude. Here is a SWOT I wrote a few years ago on the topic of digital humanities. Please make me an exhaustive and thorough prompt for OpenAI's deep research. 

I would like you to instruct openAI's deep research in to do a thorough and exhaustive search of all open, high quality, and university sources around the multiple nodes of "Digital Humanities" in 2025. Specifically, to build an annotated bibliography by source to support an update of this SWOT, but not to do the SWOT. 

Give me a readback and functional decomposition of the thing. Do you need one of my prior prompts to openai?

The user has shared a SWOT analysis they wrote on Digital Humanities and wants me to create a comprehensive prompt for OpenAI's deep research feature. They want this prompt to instruct Deep Research to gather thorough and exhaustive information about Digital Humanities in 2025 from various high-quality sources, particularly to support an update to their SWOT analysis.

Let me first analyze the content of the SWOT analysis to understand what's already covered and what needs updating:

Key points from the SWOT analysis:
1. Digital Humanities (DH) is poorly operationalized and can encompass multiple areas:
   - Corpus linguistics
   - Digital Cultures
   - "Big Data"
   - GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) preparation
   - Websites and New Media

2. Different institutions conceptualize DH differently:
   - King's College London (KCL): Broad approach including digital culture
   - Australian National University (ANU): Cybernetics approach
   - Justus Liebig University (JLU): Interdisciplinary research at the interface of humanities and computer science
   - Western Sydney University: Application of digital techniques to humanities questions

3. Strengths identified:
   - "Big Tent" approach allowing diverse applications
   - Provides interdisciplinary space for collaboration
   - Enables new research modes in Arts and Social Sciences
   - Established label for computing within arts and social sciences

4. Weaknesses identified:
   - MQ (Macquarie University?) lacks infrastructure
   - Lack of a digitally enabled research strategy
   - Declining emphasis on DH across Australia
   - Limited ability to teach advanced digital skills
   - Student and staff exhaustion/anxiety regarding technology

5. Opportunities identified:
   - Generative AI as a potential spearhead
   - Possibility of "DH 2.0" centered around AI
   - Demand for digitally literate students who can use prompts effectively

6. Threats identified:
   - Lack of communication or guidance from leadership
   - Unclear ownership of DH/Generative AI initiatives
   - Copyright/IP implications for AI
   - Infrastructure and training costs
   - Weak academic community in Australia for DH

Based on this analysis, I'll craft a prompt for OpenAI's Deep Research that addresses:
- Current state of Digital Humanities in 2025
- How different institutions globally are defining and implementing DH
- Trends in DH education and research programs
- The relationship between DH and generative AI
- Infrastructure and resources needed for effective DH programs
- Job market relevance for DH skills
- Best practices and successful models

The user wants an exhaustive and thorough prompt that will result in an annotated bibliography organized by source, not a completed SWOT analysis.

Now I'll craft this prompt with a functional decomposition to ensure comprehensive coverage.

# Prompt for OpenAI Deep Research: Digital Humanities in 2025

I've analyzed your SWOT document and crafted a comprehensive prompt for OpenAI's Deep Research. This will help gather the latest information to update your analysis with current developments in Digital Humanities.

## Primary Research Directive

Conduct a thorough and exhaustive search of all academic, institutional, and high-quality sources on Digital Humanities (DH) as of 2025. Create an annotated bibliography organized by source type to support an update of a SWOT analysis. Do not create the SWOT itself, but provide comprehensive source material that would enable such an update.

## Functional Decomposition of Research Areas

### 1. Conceptual Evolution of Digital Humanities

## Annotation Requirements

For each source, provide:
1. Complete citation in Chicago style
2. Brief summary of key findings or arguments (100-150 words)
3. Explicit relevance to SWOT categories (which strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat does this inform?)
4. Assessment of the source's reliability and potential limitations
5. Cross-references to other sources that confirm, challenge, or extend its findings

## Output Format

Organize the annotated bibliography by source type and then chronologically within each type. Include:
1. Executive summary highlighting the most significant findings (500-750 words)
2. Thematic clusters that emerged across multiple sources
3. Identification of knowledge gaps where further research is needed
4. Full annotated bibliography as described above
5. Index of institutions and their current DH initiatives

Does this approach encompass everything you need for your research? I can adjust any section to better align with your specific goals for updating the SWOT analysis.
