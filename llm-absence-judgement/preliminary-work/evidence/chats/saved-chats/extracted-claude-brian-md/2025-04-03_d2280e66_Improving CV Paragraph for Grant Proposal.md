### Human (09:57:28)

Hi Claude. Here's my CV.

Also attached is a grant a colleague and I are working on.

I would like to improve the paragraph about me. Please ask me a single, specific, question, one at a time, until you think you can improve that paragraph.

---

### Assistant (09:57:39)

 I see you've shared your impressive CV and a grant proposal you're working on with a colleague. The grant proposal contains a paragraph about you that I'll help improve through some targeted questions.

Looking at the grant proposal, I see this paragraph about you:

"Brian Ballsun-Stanton, the project lead, (a) is a philosopher of science and technology, (b) has a strong technology background including an advanced degree in IT, (c) is a groundbreaking researcher in the application of LLMs to humanities research and teaching, (d) has worked for over a decade on software development, data modelling, and reproducibility / research confidence in digital humanities, including archaeology, history, ethnography, and linguistics. In much of this work, especially (d), he has collaborated with Shawn Ross."

First question: Could you share more about your specific contributions or innovations in applying LLMs to humanities research and teaching? This would help strengthen point (c).

---

### Human (10:02:56)

Ok, so here's my blurb of workshops I can run. Plus notes from a conference organisation in Germany, plus my L&T award text, plus what I'm running in Giessen. Fundamentally, I've been driving FoA's adoption of AI, the research policy of MQ, and have just passed 30 major lectures and workshops run in US, EU, and Australia.

---

### Assistant (10:03:05)

 Based on your documents, I'd like to understand more about your specific contributions to applying LLMs to humanities research and teaching. What innovative approaches or techniques have you pioneered in this area that could strengthen point (c) in your grant proposal paragraph?

---

### Human (10:06:42)

It's the ARTS3500 text from the L&T award. If you'll notice, every item in that award is me structuring and teaching faculty and student work around AI. I also have a paper around AI-Locus of Control as preprint, looking at 

Abstract
Background: As AI disrupts education systems worldwide, there is an urgent need for students to
develop AI literacy while maintaining human agency. While locus of control (LOC), defined as
the belief that outcomes are contingent on one's own behavior versus external forces, is
traditionally viewed as a stable trait, its plasticity in response to AI experiences remains unexplored.
Objectives: This study examined how explicit instruction and guided practice with multiple
frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) impact students' knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and
sense of control over AI-mediated outcomes.
Methods: A longitudinal qualitative case study followed 12 undergraduate students through a
semester-long experimental AI unit. Data collected through surveys, focus group discussions, and
weekly observations were analysed thematically, using LOC theory as an interpretive framework.
Results and Conclusions: Students demonstrated a clear progression toward internal AI-LOC,
developing critical awareness and agency in their AI interactions. The findings revealed that
sustained, scaffolded AI instruction enabled students to view themselves, rather than the
technology, as the primary driver of outcomes. This transformation suggests that structured AI
literacy education can empower learners to maintain agency in their AI use.

A paper on proleptic reasoning and teaching with AI:

**Abstract**
This paper examines the potential educational uses of chat-based large language models (LLMs), moving past initial hype and skepticism. Although LLM outputs often evoke fascination and resemble human writing, they are unpredictable and must be used with discernment. Several metaphors—like calculators, cars, and drunk tutors—highlight distinct models for student interactions with LLMs, which we explore in the paper. We suggest that LLMs hold a potential in students’ learning by fostering proleptic reasoning through scaffolding, i.e., presenting a technological accompaniment in anticipating and responding to potential objections to arguments. Here, the technical limitations of LLMs can be reframed as beneficial when fostering anticipatory reasoning. Whether their outputs are accurate or not, evaluating them stimulates learning. LLMs require students to critically engage, emphasizing analytical thinking over mere memorization. This interaction helps solidify knowledge. Additionally, we explore how engaging with LLMs can prepare students for constructive collective discussions and provide first steps in addressing epistemic injustices by highlighting potential research blind spots. Thus, while acknowledging the sociopolitical and ethical complexities of using LLMs in education, we suggest that when used in an informed way, they can promote critical thinking through anticipatory reasoning.

And papers on the effective communication and metaphor of AI and how to understand it. Effectively, I'm extending Breen's thesis: "But the thing is: LLMs are deeply, inherently textual. And they are reliant on text in a way that is directly linked to the skills and methods that we emphasize in university humanities classes." and implementing it in classes and research across the faculty.

### Assistant (10:06:50)

 Thank you for elaborating. I see now that your work is much more groundbreaking in the LLM-humanities space than initially apparent. Let me help strengthen that paragraph about you in the grant proposal.

Based on what you've shared, I'd revise point (c) to highlight your pioneering work in several key areas:

1. You've developed frameworks for understanding AI-Locus of Control in educational settings, demonstrating how structured AI literacy education empowers learners to maintain agency
2. Your work on proleptic reasoning shows how LLMs can foster anticipatory thinking in humanities education
3. You've successfully implemented these theories across multiple disciplines in the Faculty of Arts, with documented success in ARTS3500 and other courses
4. You've established a body of research that extends Breen's thesis about LLMs being "deeply, inherently textual" in ways that align with humanities methodologies

Would you like me to draft a complete revision of that paragraph with these elements incorporated?

---

### Human (10:07:27)

What other themes can you pull out from the attached documents?

### Human (10:13:35)

our current research on technoscholasticism and both critiquing and engaging with OpenAI's Deep Research plus open source approaches. It is that research that led us to be confident in this grant. 

No, unless the AI-LOC paper has them.

 technoscholasticism, though it's WIP so....

This is the Schmidt Foundation
