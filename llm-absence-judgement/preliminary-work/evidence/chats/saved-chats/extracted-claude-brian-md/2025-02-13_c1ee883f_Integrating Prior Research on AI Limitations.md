## Conversation

### Human (22:10:14)

To begin, please synthesise yesterday's chat (prior chat 1) into the paper notes. We're getting ready to integrate another transcritp.

### Assistant (22:10:17)

 <think>
1. The prior chat shows a discussion about developing an academic paper on AI limitations, particularly Deep Research
2. The chat reveals several key themes

### Human (22:10:22)

To begin, please synthesise yesterday's chat (prior chat 1) into the paper notes. We're getting ready to integrate another transcript.

### Assistant (22:10:43)

 <think>
1. Looking at the prior chat and paper notes
2. The chat contains dictation about key concepts around agentic systems and Deep Research's limitations
3. Need to synthesize these points into a cohesive outline
4. Several themes emerge: uncanny valley of research, limitations in literature reviews, goal-following behavior
5. This should be organized as an academic outline that builds on the existing LaTeX structure
</think>

<antThinking>This outline needs to be substantial and will be referenced/modified throughout the conversation. Creating an artifact is appropriate here.</antThinking>

Transcript is attached

### Assistant (22:13:17)

 <think>
1. This transcript discusses system design requirements for better research tools
2. Key points about:
   - Need for todo lists and transparency
   - Context window management
   - Human judgment integration
   - Documentation of research stages
   - Importance of being able to "forget" or remove content
3. Need to integrate these points into the outline, particularly expanding the tool usage framework
</think>

<antThinking>The existing outline needs significant updates to incorporate these new points about system design requirements and research tool capabilities. This warrants a rewrite of the outline.</antThinking>

### Human (01:12:56)

Ok, integrate this back into the TeX document I shared with you, please.

---

### Assistant (01:13:26)

 <think>
1. Need to transform the markdown outline into LaTeX format
2. Preserve the existing document structure while adding new sections
3. Maintain consistent LaTeX formatting
4. Integrate new content while preserving existing elements
</think>

<antThinking>This requires creating a new LaTeX document artifact that combines the existing content with the new outline structure.</antThinking>

### Human (02:06:43)

My colleague reminds me that we also need to speak about what DR does well. Let's go back to the markdown outline and add a place for "Mundane Utility, and the successful uses of DR" there. (I'll record some more tomorrow morning thinking about this)

---

### Assistant (02:07:07)

 <think>
1. Need to add a section about Deep Research's successful use cases
2. This fits between the Deep Research Analysis and System Design Requirements sections
3. Should focus on practical utility and successful applications
4. Will preserve existing structure while adding new section
</think>

<antThinking>The outline needs a new major section on practical utility, warranting an update to the existing artifact.</antThinking>

Ready for your thoughts on the successful applications of Deep Research tomorrow morning.

### Human (07:40:00)

Ok, here is another transcript.

<Transcript>
00:10
I suppose I would speak to The mundane utility section. Yeah, it looks like okay.

00:32
So, if you're talking about,

00:40
If we're talking about use cases, I suppose the first place you need to be talking about is

01:10
Data collection. Um, So this is this is specifically This is specifically based on the Software apps. Um, run.

01:39
14th February. And so, so this this the software actually run was The software actually.

02:03
The opposite of the infinite archaeology one, right? So

02:13
Um, The software X run was the opposite of Internet archaeology run software. X has Uh, 30 odd volumes filled with people writing about the software tools. But Very few of them are. Archaeology historical, science and labour. Therefore, my task to it was Go find all of the articles in this journal.

02:49
That relate to. Big old tool map. And,

03:05
And to a first approximation, it did that.

03:13
But, The interesting thing here is it did that indirectly? Because those articles were not, Trivially visible. Because elsevier blocked open their eyes. Yeah. Router Uh, we needed to do here. To compare against computers. And,

03:51
It hits. What seemed like a plausible set of Articles and even hit a plausible set of borderline articles.

04:05
I am not certain. Um, and quite frankly, this is this is a a to do Sean to to see what Double check. Um, Faster can show, because

04:28
Because this is, Um, because this

04:42
A useful series for other things. Then.

04:57
If you had a topic specific,

05:21
Jp's experience, looking for something. Do better and find more. Um,

05:38
Because if we present, If we presume this community, Go find me.

06:05
The difference between the set and JP sink.

06:15
This was binding.

06:42
Which means that if somehow, You can help the computer up to limited science. Then we can use.

06:59
2d reference political biographers. For women. Because the problem.

07:21
Generations. Is. Most of

07:39
Most of them. All right. On the research topic. That we actually care about.

08:04
Okay, inner position.

08:10
Not learn. Well, because software accident discoverable. Open their eyes.

08:31
So, they are only discovered as the impacts.

08:38
Which is stupid because if it's an open access paper,

09:36
This is an actual utility. That deep research represents. Sit and make your degree. Down a poetry supervisor. Exploring research salvarians put in a cluster to a 360 class, you should get it.

10:07
Who is going to? And guys. But also need to do the A3. Definitions gamepl.

10:58
Thank you. This is the first place.

11:19
Applications.

11:29
Once we figured out the effective unit of the context,

11:46
There's food back on this.

12:22
This sort of section this sort of definite relation. Is useful.

12:50
Um, although I do know, So, I suspectful

13:33
For this sort of system I've given.

13:54
Um,

14:42
Go food every Informative ones about this.

15:12
Our applications. Um, should be not something weird.

15:29
Like, is it not better?

16:14
Famous technologies.

16:25
Dude, why are you seeing requirements?

16:32
What amounts, to?

16:40
And especially to the non-employment that is.

16:54
We assert therefore.

17:00
And PhD. Supervisor precise. Okay, who is the Botany papers for deep research shows for YouTube?

17:20
Um,

17:27
I would prefer.

17:36
What this means is that we can get much greater red.

18:31
And then talking about coins, they just post

18:45
So, marginal papers. He was very interesting. For the PhD student to bring the output of models. And then to verify and constructure.

19:16
Actually plot. Okay, can you can you engage with some corrective argumentation here. Now, let's see what the mechanical places.

19:35
Is sufficient for effective, use cases.

19:46
Let's see how you just.

### Assistant (07:40:17)

 <think>
1. This transcript discusses successful use cases of Deep Research, focusing on:
   - Data collection capabilities
   - Finding articles in journals
   - Use in academic research
   - Benefits for PhD students
2. Key points:
   - Example of software archaeology research
   - Ability to find non-obvious connections
   - Value in exploring research variations
   - Role in supervision and guidance
3. Need to update the "Mundane Utility" section with these concrete examples
</think>

<antThinking>The outline needs updating to incorporate these specific examples and use cases in the Mundane Utility section.</antThinking>
