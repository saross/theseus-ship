Hi Claude. I need your help making a prompt for OpenAI's Deep Research. 

First, here's what I gave to perplexity's run.


```

We aim to explore the existing literature (from approximately 2013 onward) on how male reproductive physiology in birds (Aves) changes between breeding and non-breeding states. Here, “male reproductive physiology” refers to any measure or mechanism related to sperm production (including sperm count, morphology, and seminal fluid composition), endocrine regulation (hormones like testosterone, LH, FSH, GnRH), and morphological or histological shifts in gonads or associated reproductive structures (e.g., testes, seminal glomeruli). Studies discussing neural correlates (brain regions tied to reproduction, including song production) are also relevant if they explicitly address seasonal or breeding-state differences.
Our goal is to capture data from both field and laboratory studies across diverse avian families, focusing on how hormonal levels, testicular volume, and sperm parameters fluctuate with shifts in photoperiod, resource availability, or other environmental cues or changes in social cues (e.g. previous breeding experience). We are particularly interested in comparative analyses that highlight interspecific or interpopulational differences, as well as underlying ecological and evolutionary drivers of these physiological changes. Potential keywords may include (“bird*” OR avian OR Aves) AND (“male reproductive physiology” OR testes OR sperm OR “seminal fluid” OR hormones OR testosterone) AND (breeding OR “non-breeding” OR seasonal OR flexible) AND (successful OR unsuccessful OR paired OR unpaired OR divorce). By synthesizing these findings, we hope to better understand the proximate (physiological) and ultimate (evolutionary) factors shaping reproductive cycles in male birds
```

Pause, I need to poke something to attach my colleague's response.

 Hello! I'll help you create a prompt for OpenAI's Deep Research based on your query about male reproductive physiology in birds. Let me first analyze the documents you've shared, which contain reviews of how Perplexity and Elicit handled similar queries.

Based on the critiques in these reviews, I can see several issues that should be addressed in your new prompt:

1. Better organization of information (avoiding misalignment between section headers and content)
2. More appropriate categorization (the reviewers didn't like the Temperate vs. Tropical categorization)
3. Avoiding citation issues (wrong species, papers about females not males, mammals not birds)
4. Ensuring full-text extraction rather than just abstracts
5. Better filtering of relevant papers

Would you like me to proceed with drafting a revised prompt for Deep Research that addresses these specific concerns? Or was there something particular from the reviews that you wanted to focus on?

 I'll help you create a prompt for OpenAI's Deep Research based on the information you've provided. Looking at the prompt you used for Perplexity and the review documents, I see that you're trying to create an improved literature search about male reproductive physiology in birds.

Let me know when you've attached your colleague's response, and I'll help you craft a stronger prompt that addresses the issues you identified in the Perplexity and Elicit outputs.

Apologies, I have attached my colleague's response 3 times. The interface was strange.

ANYWAYS. Please take my initial prompt plus my colleague's critique and adjust it for OpenAI's Deep Research.

 I'll craft an improved prompt for OpenAI's Deep Research based on your initial prompt and your colleague's critique. I'll address the issues identified while maintaining the core research focus.

Here's my adjusted prompt:

```
Conduct a comprehensive review of literature (from 2013 onward) on male reproductive physiology in birds (Aves), with emphasis on physiological changes between breeding and non-breeding states.

Focus areas should include:
1. Sperm production parameters (count, morphology, motility, and seminal fluid composition)
2. Endocrine regulation (specifically testosterone, LH, FSH, GnRH, and other relevant hormones)
3. Morphological and histological changes in reproductive structures (testes, cloacal protuberance, seminal glomeruli)
4. Neural correlates explicitly tied to reproductive state changes

Include both field and laboratory studies across diverse avian taxa. Particular attention should be given to:
- Hormonal fluctuations in response to environmental cues (photoperiod, rainfall) and social factors
- Comparative analyses highlighting differences between species, populations, or latitudinal gradients
- Studies documenting physiological responses to breeding success/failure or pair-bonding status
- Clear distinction between temperate/seasonal breeders and tropical/opportunistic breeders
- Underlying evolutionary mechanisms driving reproductive flexibility

When citing papers, ensure:
1. Species identifications are accurate
2. Citations directly support the claims being made
3. Studies involve male birds (not females or non-avian species)
4. For foundational concepts like the Challenge Hypothesis, cite original seminal works regardless of publication date

For each major finding, specify:
- The exact species and taxonomic family studied
- The specific physiological parameter measured
- The environmental or social cue correlated with change
- Whether full-text analysis was conducted or only abstract review

Organize findings by physiological systems rather than by geographical categories, with clear connections between section headers and content.
```

This revised prompt addresses several issues from the critique:
- Requests more accurate citation practices
- Suggests a better organizational structure (by physiological systems rather than geographical categories)
- Emphasizes the need for full-text analysis where possible
- Requests clear differentiation between seasonal and opportunistic breeders
- Specifically asks to verify species are correct and studies involve males
- Allows inclusion of seminal papers for foundational concepts
- Requests detailed information about parameters measured and species studied

Would you like me to refine this prompt further in any specific direction?
