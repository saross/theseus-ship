Hi Claude. Here is some WIP markdown for Quarto for a presentation in Oxford I'm giving in 30 minutes. 

I'll be attaching some of my papers in the https://zenodo.org/communities/iacap-aisb-25-teachingai/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest symposium) I'd like to have a  quarto slide on each, please.

The user is preparing a presentation for Oxford in 30 minutes and wants me to create Quarto slides for their papers from a symposium. They've provided a WIP markdown file for a presentation about "Teaching (and Research) with and about AI" by Brian Ballsun-Stanton.

Looking at the content, they have several sections:
1. Introduction 
2. An Absence of Judgement: AI "Deep Research" - about technoscholasticism and AI's epistemic limitations
3. EAL/D Vocabulary Learning: AI-Powered Robust Instruction - about using AI for language learning
4. Teaching with and about AI
5. AI in Teaching and assessment for postgrads
6. Research Policy

The user mentions they'll be attaching papers from the IACAP-AISB symposium and wants a Quarto slide for each. However, I don't see any attached papers yet. 

Since they're giving this in 30 minutes, I should help them complete what they have and prepare for adding slides about their papers when they attach them. I can help polish the existing content and suggest improvements to make it presentation-ready.I can see you're preparing a presentation on "Teaching (and Research) with and about AI" for Oxford. Your current slides cover AI deep research, EAL/D vocabulary learning, and have placeholders for teaching/assessment sections.

I notice you haven't attached the papers from the IACAP-AISB symposium yet. Once you attach them, I'll create a Quarto slide for each paper that fits into your presentation structure.

In the meantime, would you like me to:
1. Help polish/expand the existing slides you have?
2. Create placeholder slides for the empty sections (Teaching with

Here are the three papers.

### Assistant (07:21:28)

I have been provided with three papers to create Quarto slides for the presentation on "Teaching (and Research) with and about AI" at Oxford. Let me analyze each paper and create appropriate slides for them.

Paper 1: "The Emperor's New Clothes: A Manifesto for Universities in an AI-Haunted World [Extended Abstract]" by Brian Ballsun-Stanton and Maryam Khalid

Key points:
- Universities face an existential crisis revealed by AI
- Higher education has become a degenerating research programme (using Lakatos' framework)
- Drawing on evidence from an experimental AI-integrated unit at Macquarie University
- Three interlocking questions about content-increasing education, meaningful world-making, and transformative learning
- Design principles for post-transactional universities

Paper 2: "Teaching Students How to Effectively Interact with LLMs at University: Insights on the Longitudinal Development and Plasticity of Locus of Control" by Jodie Torrington, Brian Ballsun-Stanton, and Jennifer WM Lai

Key points:
- Longitudinal qualitative case study of 12 undergraduate students
- Examines how explicit instruction with LLMs impacts students' knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and sense of control
- Students demonstrated progression toward internal AI-LOC (Locus of Control)
- Structured AI literacy education can empower learners to maintain agency

Paper 3: "Teaching the Unknown: A Pedagogical Framework for Teaching With and About AI" by Brian Ballsun-Stanton and Jodie Torrington

Key points:
- Four-pillar framework: risk-embracing assessment, navigating technological uncertainty, intentional classroom culture, facilitating transformative learning
- Drawing on Transformative Learning Theory and Rumsfeld's epistemological matrix
- Productive failure as an effective pedagogical strategy
- AI as a textual technology that extends humanities capabilities

I'll create slides that fit into the existing presentation structure.I'll create Quarto slides for each of your three papers that will fit into your presentation structure. Here they are:

## The Emperor's New Clothes: Universities in an AI-Haunted World

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Crisis Revealed, Not Caused**
- Universities as "degenerating research programme" (Lakatos)
- Maintaining formal structures while abandoning substance
- Transactional model: "time and money exchanged for credentials"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Three Interlocking Questions**
1. What constitutes content-increasing education when AI handles information transfer?
2. How can universities reconnect education to meaningful world-making?
3. What practices enable transformative rather than transactional learning?
:::
::::

### Design Principles for Post-Transactional Universities
- **Rapid transition** between content delivery and capability development
- **Connect learning to real-world impact** beyond token employability
- **Reward process mastery** over output production
- **Embrace productive failure** as pedagogy
- **Develop new forms of social proof** beyond grades

:::: {.notes}
This paper uses Lakatos' philosophy of science to argue that higher education has become a degenerating research programme. Evidence from our experimental AI unit suggests paths forward.
::::

## Developing AI-Internal Locus of Control

### From External to Internal AI-LOC
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
**Initial State (External AI-LOC)**
- AI viewed as "God" or authority
- Defer to AI outputs
- "Plastic pal who's fun to be with"
- Passive consumption of AI content
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
**Final State (Internal AI-LOC)**
- Human retains agency
- Critical evaluation of outputs
- Strategic tool selection
- "I can use it in a way that's really effective"
:::
::::

### Key Findings
- **12-week progression** documented through surveys, focus groups, observations
- **Explicit instruction matters**: Students need guided practice with frontier models
- **Reflection cycles critical**: "Show me your prompts" discussions build agency
- **AI-LOC is malleable**: Despite being traditionally stable, can shift with sustained intervention

:::: {.notes}
This longitudinal study tracked how students' relationship with AI transformed from seeing it as an authority to understanding it as a tool they direct.
::::

## Teaching the Unknown: A Four-Pillar Framework

### Pedagogical Framework for AI Education

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**1. Risk-Embracing Assessment**
- Decouple task success from grades
- Value process documentation
- Reward productive failure
- "Fail-forward" approach

**2. Navigating Uncertainty**
- Embrace unknown unknowns
- Convert unknowns to knowns systematically
- Model epistemic humility
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**3. Classroom Culture**
- "Show me your prompts" ritual
- Educator vulnerability as strategy
- Collaborative grimoire development
- Psychological safety through routine

**4. Transformative Learning**
- Structured disorienting dilemmas
- Critical reflection on AI interactions
- Communal discourse
- Agency development
:::
::::

### Key Insight: AI as Textual Technology
- Humanities methodologies **directly applicable** to AI pedagogy
- Critical textual analysis transfers to prompt engineering
- Existing educator competencies need **translation, not replacement**

:::: {.notes}
This framework emerged from teaching three disciplinary streams using AI. We found that productive failure and epistemic humility were essential for developing student agency.
::::

## Research Policy Implications

### Institutional Requirements for AI Education
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Resource Needs**
- Access to frontier models (not just free/basic versions)
- Protected experimental time
- Professional development funding
- Policy space for innovation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cultural Shifts Required**
- Value process over demonstrable competencies
- Support bottom-up innovation
- Recognize epistemic uncertainty as valid
- Reframe assessment paradigms
:::
::::

### Three Levels of Impact
1. **Educational Theory**: Productive failure and uncertainty navigation challenge traditional knowledge progression models
2. **Educator Praxis**: Humanities skills are foundational for AI literacy - we need translation, not retraining
3. **University Context**: New quality frameworks needed that value process-focused assessment

:::: {.notes}
These papers collectively argue for fundamental shifts in how universities approach AI integration, from individual classroom practices to institutional policies.

These slides integrate your research findings while maintaining the flow of your presentation. Would you like me to adjust the formatting, add more detail to any section, or help polish other parts of your presentation?
