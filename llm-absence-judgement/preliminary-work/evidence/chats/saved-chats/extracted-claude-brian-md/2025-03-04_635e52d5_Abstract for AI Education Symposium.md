### Human (18:59:22)

Hi Claude. Can you please make a 100 word abstract out of the attached document?

For context, the session it has been submitted to is also attached

### Assistant (18:59:36)

 I'll create a 100-word abstract based on the extended abstract you've shared, tailored for the Teaching With and About AI using Engagement Philosophy and Case Studies Symposium.

Your abstract is currently 100 words, which perfectly matches your requirement. It highlights the key aspects of your research while aligning with the symposium's focus on engagement philosophy and case studies in AI education.

The abstract emphasizes:
- The ethnographic methodology
- The transformation in students' relationship with AI
- The pedagogical approach (experiential learning, collaboration, reflection)
- The value humanities students bring to AI discourse
- The implications for AI education

Would you like me to make any adjustments to focus more on specific aspects of your research, or is this abstract suitable for your submission to the IACAP/AISB-25 symposium?

ok, I need to find 10 words to cut from the original text. I've already cut the references. Please don't rewrite it, just tell me where.

### Assistant (19:10:47)

 Looking at your abstract, here are 10 words that could be cut while preserving the key content and meaning:

1. "through experiential learning" - Remove "experiential" (saves 1 word)
2. "following engagement philosophy principles" - Remove "principles" (saves 1 word)
3. "with Large Language Models" - Remove "Large" (saves 1 word)
4. "evolved from perceiving AI as intimidating" - Remove "perceiving" (saves 1 word)
5. "key pedagogical factors included" - Remove "key" (saves 1 word)
6. "hands-on exploration" - Remove "hands-on" (saves 1 word)
7. "collaborative meaning-making" - Remove "meaning-" (saves 1 word)
8. "bring valuable critical thinking and ethical reasoning" - Remove "valuable" (saves 1 word)
9. "offers a model for AI education that bridges" - Remove "that" (saves 1 word)
10. "informed contributors to societal conversations" - Remove "societal" (saves 1 word)

These cuts maintain the substance of your abstract while reducing the word count by exactly 10 words.

### Human (19:10:58)

And the next 10?

### Assistant (19:11:03)

 Here are 10 more words that could be cut while still preserving the core meaning of your abstract:

1. "This ethnographic study" - Remove "This" (saves 1 word)
2. "examines how a university seminar" - Remove "university" (saves 1 word)
3. "transformed humanities students' relationship" - Remove "humanities" (saves 1 word) 
4. "students evolved from... as intimidating" - Remove "as" (saves 1 word)
5. "to engaging critically with its applications" - Remove "critically" (saves 1 word)
6. "pedagogical factors included" - Remove "included" (saves 1 word)
7. "exploration, collaborative making, and reflective practice" - Remove "and" (saves 1 word)
8. "Findings suggest humanities students bring" - Remove "Findings" (saves 1 word)
9. "The study offers a model for AI education" - Remove "The" (saves 1 word)
10. "philosophical inquiry, positioning humanities students" - Remove "humanities" (saves 1 word)

These additional cuts would reduce your abstract by another 10 words while maintaining its essential message about your research.

### Human (19:12:20)

ok, I need to find 15 words to cut from the original text. Pull from the word doc. Don't rewrite it, just give me the changes you suggest

---

### Assistant (19:12:26)

 I'll identify 15 words to cut from your extended abstract without rewriting it. Here are my suggested cuts from specific sections:

1. From the Introduction:
- Remove "collectively described here as their \"digital habitus\"" (8 words)

2. From Technical Competencies:
- Remove "largely" before "intimidated by AI" (1 word)
- Remove "effectively" after "operate AI tools" (1 word)

3. From Ethical Consciousness:
- Remove "for example," before "a student-led" (2 words)

4. From Transformations in Attitudes:
- Remove "profound" before "shift in their attitudes" (1 word)

5. From Broader Implications:
- Remove "unique" before "skills" (1 word)
- Remove "passive consumption or" (3 words)

Total words cut: 17 words (slightly over your target of 15)

These cuts preserve the key content and meaning while trimming some descriptive modifiers and examples that aren't essential to understanding your main points.

### Human (19:14:09)

ok, 3 more words

---

### Assistant (19:14:12)

 Here are 3 more words to cut from the extended abstract:

1. From Methodology section:
- Remove "real-time" before "data on students' evolving skills" (2 words)

2. From Conclusion:
- Remove "thus" before "offers a model" (1 word)

Total additional words cut: 3 words

These cuts maintain the document's meaning while removing non-essential modifiers.
