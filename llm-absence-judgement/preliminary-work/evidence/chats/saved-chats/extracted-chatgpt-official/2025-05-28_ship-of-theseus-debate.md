Can you generate an image for me based on this quote about the 'ship of theseus'?

The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians…for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.

{
  "prompt": "A symbolic and philosophical depiction of the Ship of Theseus. A large ancient Greek ship with thirty oars is docked at an Athenian harbour. Half the ship is made of old, decaying wooden planks, while the other half has newly replaced, strong timber. The setting is classical Athens, with philosophers in traditional robes on the pier, engaged in debate. The background includes the Acropolis and a soft sunset. The scene is contemplative and reflective, representing the paradox of identity and change.",

that's a great image - let's do one more. For a little more context, the  image is to illustrate an academic research paper that uses the ship of theseus as a metaphor for the software ecosystem supporting archaeological research (i.e., that archaeologists use a lot of individual software tools, scripts, and packages  where each particular tool may come and go but the whole system needs to continue working, so when someone designes research software they should emphasise end of life planning and interoperatbility

{
  "prompt": "A symbolic painting in a classical style depicting the Ship of Theseus sailing on calm seas, but with a modern twist. The ship is built from wooden planks labeled with names of software tools, scripts, and packages commonly used in archaeological research (e.g., GIS software, 3D modelling tools, databases, Python scripts). Some planks are aged and being replaced by new ones labeled with newer tools, showing the evolution of the research software ecosystem. Onshore, ancient Greek philosophers observe and discuss, while modern archaeologists in field gear, with laptops and drones, look on from another part of the scene. The image should evoke a sense of continuity, transformation, and the philosophical puzzle of identity over time, symbolising the importance of planning for interoperability and end-of-life in software tools.",
