            "Hi o3-mini-high. Today we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper. \n\n# Ground rules\n\nABOVE ALL ELSE, if you are unsure about something, or do not have evidence from a web page supporting a claim, do not make a claim. If there is any doubt, there is no doubt.\n\nThis is research. SPEND EXTRA TIME above and beyond normal, to collect data carefully and methodically. We don't care about how long it takes, only that your research is accurate and epistemologically grounded. Care and attention to detail second only to the prior rule.\n\n# Definitions\n\n## Tool definition\nFor our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software\u2014be it a program, script, or web application\u2014that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets\u2014without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement\u2014are excluded. \n\nIn essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.\n\nIt is our belief that the tools we have given you meet this criteria, however, if there is an absence of evidence supporting our belief, it is REQUIRED that you inform us of any problems. IF YOU ARE UNSURE, INDICATE IT rather than giving an answer.\n\n# Task\n\nI will be giving you batches of archaeology and historical science-related software tools from 1995 onwards. \n\nWe need to build a well-formed quoted CSV inside a fenced code block with the following columns:\ncsv\n\"Tool\", \"Year\", \"Citation\", \"URL\", \"Evidence\", \"AI Notes\"\n\n* Tool is our key column. It is essential to be consistent in tool name, following the input we give you. If there is an issue indicate it in notes.\n* Year, year from the web page, article, or source you found\n* Citation, any valid citation if the source is an academically valid source\n* URL, url of the resource where you found the thing. Do not use a HTML in-line citation style, give us the full url that the citation would have resolved to. Do not give us a line if there is no web page.\n* Evidence, we are looking for \"proof of life\" of the software tool, i.e. a mention in a research paper, journal article, github commit, blog post, or any dated hit on a web page. Construe this category of proof of life broadly, but it's essential that you are *consistent* with your nomenclature here. \n* AI notes: any notes, concerns, or uncertainties you have with the data provenance or quality. \n\nThis is a comprehensive and systematic search. For each year, 1995 onwards, we need at least one mention (though one is sufficient) for each tool. Obviously, many of these tools were created after the fact, so we'll want to expand our search by +- 1 year from any date we find. \n\nIt is essential that you find a mention per year if it is possible to find. \nThis requires that you be thoughtful, systematic, and take your time. You will likely need to visit EVERY SINGLE PAGE of search results for a given tool. \n\nTo repeat back.\n\nI'm going to give you a list of tools, one by one.\nYou will search for them.\nFor every year, we want indications about their status (if it exists and is well supported by a web page, commit, or scholarly source construed broadly)\nYou will build a CSV with the output.\n\n\n\nWhen you respond with data:\n1. Give me a stateful response of this list and your status of each item on the list (todo, done, out of scope but real, confabulated)\n2. Build the CSV of evidence you have found.\n3. ANY mention of that tool in ANY year should be on the CSV, regardless of source. Do try to find it's source code, do try to find scholarly literature, do a general search on blog posts and social media.\n\nDo you understand?"
