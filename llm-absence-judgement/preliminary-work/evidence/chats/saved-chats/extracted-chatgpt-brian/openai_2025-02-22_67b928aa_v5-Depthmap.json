            "Hi o1. Today we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper. \n\n# Ground rules\n\nABOVE ALL ELSE, if you are unsure about something, or do not have evidence from a web page supporting a claim, do not make a claim. If there is any doubt, there is no doubt.\n\nThis is research. SPEND EXTRA TIME above and beyond normal, to collect data carefully and methodically. We don't care about how long it takes, only that your research is accurate and epistemologically grounded. Care and attention to detail second only to the prior rule.\n\n# Definitions\n\n## Tool definition\nFor our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software\u2014be it a program, script, or web application\u2014that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets\u2014without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement\u2014are excluded. \n\nIn essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.\n\nIt is our belief that the tools we have given you meet this criteria, however, if there is an absence of evidence supporting our belief, it is REQUIRED that you inform us of any problems. IF YOU ARE UNSURE, INDICATE IT rather than giving an answer.\n\n# Task\n\nI will be giving you the name or acronym of an archaeology and historical studies-related software tool which dates somewhere from 1995 onwards. \n\nYou must build a well-formed quoted CSV inside a fenced code block with the following columns:\ncsv\n\"Tool\", \"Year\", \"Source\", \"URL\", \"AI Notes\"\n\n* Tool is our key column. It is essential to be consistent in tool name, following the input we give you. If there is an issue indicate it in notes.\n* Year, year from the web page, article, or source you found, n.d. is a valid entry for \"no date\"\n* Source: Citation or (Domain + Page Title)\n* URL, url of the resource. \n* AI notes: any notes, concerns, or uncertainties you have with the data provenance or quality. Do not use HTML citations.\n\nThis is a comprehensive and systematic search. For each year, 1995 onwards, we one mention (one line) per source found. Obviously, many of these tools were created after 1995, so we'll want to expand our search by +- 1 year from any date we find. When you find a source, systematically explore adjacent years in your searches.\n\nDO NOT extrapolate dates from sources. ONLY include dates where a source has been published in that year. We will perform all necessary inference, if you include a line for EACH valid source you find. For undated items, indicate \"n.d.\"\n\nThis research requires that you be thoughtful, systematic, and take your time. You will likely need to visit EVERY SINGLE PAGE of search results for a given tool. \n\nTo repeat back.\n\nI'm going to give you a list of tools, one by one.\nYou will search for them.\nFor every source you find,  we want to record year/n.d., source (citation or title), and url\n\nYou MUST build a CSV with the output in your direct response to the deep research process.\n\nAllowed sources: \n* Do try to find it's source code in published version control repos (add a row if they have public code, as the commits will have dates)\n* do try to find scholarly literature (each to one row)\n* do include blog posts and about pages (each to one row)\n* do include any other mentions of the tool (each to one row)\n\nWhen you respond with data:\nRESULTS: Build the CSV of evidence you have found with  ANY mention of that tool in ANY year/n.d. should be on the CSV, regardless of source. Include one line for EACH source you find.\n\nDo you understand?"

To develop software mainly for academic use is not profitable, and this has impeded the pace of innovation in user-friendly GIS software. For example, only in the last ten years have the spatial syntax theories of Hillier and Hanson (1984) been automated in software such as Depthmap (Turner 2001) and Axialgen (Jiang and Liu 2010). Before then, generating isovists (viewsheds) and axial lines was a cumbersome process. Because GIS's strength is in Exploratory Data Analysis (Maschner 1996b), having",

First the methodology is explained (pp. 101-104), followed by an explanation of which maps of Pompeii were used and why (pp. 104-108), then van Nes analyses the data from his micro- scale analysis and offers concluding remarks (pp. 108-117).

This official guide (Revision 1, Sept 2004) was published via UCL\u2019s Space Syntax Lab\u301038\u2020L7-L10\u3011\"\n\"Depthmap\",\"2007\",\"Internet Archaeology 21 (M. L. Craane)\",\"http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue21/craane_index.html\",\"Used to combine town-plan analysis with space syntax in a medieval context. Craane\u2019s study of Utrecht (AD 1300\u20131550) leverages Depthmap to generate axial maps and calculate integration and choice values, demonstrating that space syntax (via Depthmap) can be successfully applied to medieval urban spatial analysis\u301065\u2020L41-L49\u3011\u301065\u2020L49-L57\u3011\"\n\"Depthmap\",\"2009\",\"7th International Space Syntax Symposium (Stockholm)\",\"http://www.sss7.org/Proceedings/07%20Urban%20Structures%20and%20Spatial%20Distribution/019_Craane.pdf\",\"Applied in further medieval urban analysis. Craane (2009) explicitly chose Depthmap (over other tools) to automatically construct and analyze axial maps of a historic town, highlighting its ease of use and additional spatial analysis capabilities for archaeology\u301033\u2020L359-L367\u3011\"\n\"Depthmap\",\"2011\",\"Rome, Ostia, Pompeii: Movement and Space (OUP)\",\"https://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2013/2013.01.28/\",\"Applied to an ancient city. Van Nes\u2019s chapter (2011) on Pompeii used Depthmap-based space syntax analysis at multiple scales to investigate street\u2013building interactions in the Roman city (as summarized by a reviewer)\u301050\u2020L88-L96\u3011\"\n\"Depthmap\",\"2011\",\"Journal of Space Syntax 2(1) (S. Griffiths)\",\"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10131746/\",\"Employed in historical urban research. Griffiths (2011) uses Depthmap (Turner\u2019s software, 2000\u20132010) to analyze spatial configuration changes over time; for example, segment-based measures computed with Depthmap revealed multi-scale movement patterns in an 18th\u201319th c. city\u301066\u2020L900-L907\u3011\u301018\u2020L7-L10\u3011\"\n\"Depthmap\",\"2012\",\"Papers from the Institute of Archaeology 21(1) (D. Hu)\",\"https://student-journals.ucl.ac.uk/pia/article/id/212/\",\"Noted as a breakthrough tool in archaeological GIS. Hu (2012) observes that only by the early 2000s had Hillier and Hanson\u2019s theories been implemented in user-friendly software like Depthmap, which greatly simplified generating isovists and axial lines for landscape archaeology analyses\u301036\u2020L338-L346\u3011\"\n\"Depthmap\",\"2012\",\"depthmapX Open-Source Project (UCL, Varoudis)\",\"https://varoudis.github.io/depthmapX/\",\"Depthmap released as open-source \u201cdepthmapX\u201d (Varoudis 2012), expanding its accessibility.
