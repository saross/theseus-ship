            "Teaching the Unknown: Risk and Agency \r\nin the Time of AI in the Classroom\r\nBrian Ballsun-Stanton and Jodie Torrington\r\nIntroduction \r\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) has disrupted education systems worldwide, \r\nnecessitating novel pedagogical approaches. While education leaders grapple with broad \r\nconcepts of AI literacy and assessment reform (Lodge et al., 2023; Liu & Bates, 2025; \r\nUNESCO, 2023), less attention has been paid to the fundamental pedagogical challenges of \r\nteaching with and about a technology that is characterised by emergent properties, shifting \r\ncapabilities, and inherent uncertainties. This paper argues that effectively teaching with and \r\nabout AI requires pedagogical frameworks specifically designed to embrace uncertainty, \r\nstructure risk-taking, and develop student agency in the face of technological indeterminacy. \r\nDrawing on Transformative Learning Theory (Mezirow, 1991) and the epistemological \r\nframework of the Rumsfeld Matrix (Rumsfeld, 2002), we examine how deliberately decoupling \r\ntask success from assessment outcomes creates educational environments where students can \r\ndevelop sophisticated intuitions about AI interaction without the inhibiting effects of grade\u0002related anxieties. This approach directly counters students' initial tendency to defer to AI rather \r\nthan direct it (Torrington et al., 2025), facilitating a shift toward internal AI-Locus of Control \r\nthrough structured experimentation with failure.\r\nTheoretical Frameworks\r\nTransformative Learning Theory (Mezirow, 1991, 2018) provides a framework for \r\nunderstanding the pedagogical challenges of AI education. Mezirow's theory posits that \r\nlearning occurs through critical reflection on disorienting dilemmas: experiences that disrupt \r\nexisting assumptions and necessitate a re-evaluation of beliefs, values, and perspectives. This \r\nprocess involves three interconnected themes relevant to AI education: experiential \r\nengagement, critical reflection, and rational discourse.\r\nThe Rumsfeld Matrix (Rumsfeld, 2002, Pawson et al., 2011) offers a complementary \r\nepistemological framework for conceptualising the pedagogical challenges of teaching AI \r\nliteracy. The matrix distinguishes between \"known knowns\" (facts we're aware of and \r\nunderstand), \"known unknowns\" (factors we know exist but don't fully comprehend), \r\n\"unknown knowns\" (subconscious knowledge we don't realise we possess), and \"unknown \r\nunknowns\" (factors we're unaware of and can't predict). The course deliberately designed \r\nexperiences to transform unknown unknowns into known unknowns: making students aware \r\nof AI's limitations, biases, and effective interaction patterns through structured experimentation \r\nand collective reflection.",
            "<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 2 / 4>",
            "Methodology\r\nThe pedagogical approach was implemented in a 13-week undergraduate Politics and \r\nInternational Relations course teaching the pragmatics of AI within a disciplinary lens. \r\nStudents engaged in AI-augmented international relations simulations, using AI to articulate \r\ndifferent ideological lenses, explore policy options, and analyse outputs for bias and safety \r\nrisks. The course produced three primary data sources for this research: student reflections, \r\nobservations, and annotated AI interaction logs.\r\nThe core methodological innovation was the deliberate decoupling of success in AI activities \r\nfrom assessment outcomes. Students were graded exclusively on their reflections about their \r\nexperiences\u2014both successes and failures\u2014rather than on the quality of AI outputs or \r\nsimulation outcomes. This approach required significant time investment in building student \r\ntrust; it took approximately eight weeks of the 13-week course before students fully accepted \r\nthat experimentation and failure were truly valued in the assessment scheme.\r\nPedagogical Design\r\nThe course's pedagogical design was built around three interconnected approaches to teaching \r\nunder conditions of technological uncertainty:\r\nRisk-Embracing Assessment Structure\r\nThe foundation of our approach was an assessment structure that explicitly rewarded risk\u0002taking and critical reflection. Assessment tasks evaluated students' ability to articulate their \r\nlearning from both successful and unsuccessful AI interactions, creating a psychological safety \r\nzone where experimental failure carried no grade penalties. As one student reflected, \"I think \r\nI've learned more in my failures in this class than in what went right. Being able to fail has been \r\nreally advantageous to my learning\" (Student reflection, Week 9).\r\nThis approach directly countered students' initial tendency to avoid risk and defer to AI outputs. \r\nBy evaluating reflection quality rather than AI interaction outcomes, we created conditions \r\nwhere students could develop sophisticated intuitions about AI capabilities without inhibition. \r\nIntentional Classroom Cultural Development\r\nCourse design intentionally fostered a community of practice centred on shared \r\nexperimentation with AI. Each class began with a \"Show me your prompts!\" discussion where \r\nstudents shared AI interactions from the previous week, analysing both effective and \r\nineffective prompting strategies. This practice created a collaborative learning environment \r\nwhere mistakes and failures became valuable community resources rather than sources of \r\nembarrassment.\r\nThe instructor deliberately modelled vulnerability by sharing personal AI interaction failures, \r\nnormalising experimentation and establishing trust. As the semester progressed, students \r\nincreasingly engaged in peer-to-peer learning, with more experienced students offering ",
            "<PARSED TEXT FOR PAGE: 3 / 4>",
            "guidance to those struggling with effective AI prompting. This socio-constructivist approach \r\nfacilitated the development of shared knowledge about effective AI interaction patterns.\r\nNavigating Uncertainty\r\nThe course employed structured but open-ended simulations to navigate the \"unknown \r\nunknowns\" of AI interaction. Students were encouraged to develop explicit expectations for \r\nAI outputs before prompting, then use the gaps between expectations and reality to refine their \r\nconceptual understanding of AI capabilities and limitations. This approach shifted students \r\nfrom viewing AI as a mysterious black box to seeing it as a tool with predictable patterns of \r\nbehaviour. The 13-week semester provided sufficient duration for students to progress through \r\ncycles of experimentation, failure, reflection, and reconceptualisation. \r\nDiscussion and Implications\r\nThis pedagogical approach carries significant implications for teaching with emerging \r\ntechnologies. Traditional education often emphasises certainty, correctness, and predictability; \r\nqualities fundamentally at odds with the emergent, probabilistic nature of contemporary AI \r\nsystems. By structuring learning experiences around uncertainty and ambiguity, this approach \r\nprepares students for technological environments characterised by continual change and \r\nunpredictability.\r\nThe findings suggest that developing AI literacy requires not only technical knowledge but also \r\nepistemic humility: a willingness to engage with uncertainty, recognise limitations, and \r\ncontinually reassess assumptions. This perspective aligns with humanistic approaches to \r\ntechnology that prioritise human agency over technological determinism.\r\nSignificantly, this approach contradicts common institutional responses to AI that focus \r\nprimarily on restriction, detection, and control. Instead, it suggests that education should \r\nembrace AI's ambiguities as pedagogical opportunities, using technological uncertainty as a \r\nvehicle for developing critical thinking and agency.\r\nConclusion \r\nTransformative Learning Theory and the Rumsfeld Matrix provide complementary \r\nframeworks for teaching with and about AI in higher education. By framing AI not as a \r\ndefinitive answer engine but as a provocateur of critical inquiry, educators can cultivate \r\nlearners who embrace uncertainty while systematically probing AI's limitations, exercise \r\nethical agency while advocating for equitable AI systems, and reimagine creativity while \r\nharnessing AI as a collaborator in transcending conventional thought boundaries. This paper \r\nwill support the development of pedagogical frameworks specifically designed to navigate \r\ntechnological uncertainty will become essential.",

These AI tools, which only use statistical probabilities to assemble useful text without understanding context, reveal gaps in the current assessment models that prioritize memorizing information over genuine understanding. AI has the potential to benefit education by easing teachers' administrative loads, but current systems are not adequately prepared to integrate these technologies effectively. Successful implementation requires a reevaluation of educational goals, emphasizing high-level thinking and creativity over rote memorization. The integration of AI literacy alongside traditional subjects could enhance critical thinking and creativity. Adapting to AI's rise is imperative to ensure that these technologies enrich human skills rather than replace them, shaping a future where AI complements human intelligence.",

                  "snippet": "In a recent article, Anthony Seldon highlights the urgent need to address the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence (AI). Drawing a historical parallel to Albert Einstein's 1939 warning to President Roosevelt about the risks of nuclear weapons, Seldon emphasizes that AI could prove an even more significant threat. While autonomous AI weapons and the concept of superintelligence are concerning, Seldon argues that the primary danger lies in AI's subtle and pervasive impact on human values and cognitive development. The rapid advancement of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) threatens to undermine education, mental health, and job satisfaction. Notable figures such as Neil Lawrence and Geoffrey Hinton have voiced their anxieties, suggesting that action is needed within the next two years to mitigate potential harms. Seldon advocates for a grass-roots response involving educators, parents, and professionals to safeguard the benefits of AI while preserving essential human qualities. The future of humanity, he contends, is at stake, and proactive measures must be taken promptly.",

These AI tools, which only use statistical probabilities to assemble useful text without understanding context, reveal gaps in the current assessment models that prioritize memorizing information over genuine understanding. AI has the potential to benefit education by easing teachers' administrative loads, but current systems are not adequately prepared to integrate these technologies effectively. Successful implementation requires a reevaluation of educational goals, emphasizing high-level thinking and creativity over rote memorization. The integration of AI literacy alongside traditional subjects could enhance critical thinking and creativity. Adapting to AI's rise is imperative to ensure that these technologies enrich human skills rather than replace them, shaping a future where AI complements human intelligence.",

            "# Annotated Bibliography: *Teaching the Unknown* \u2013 Key Educational Themes\n\n## 1. Decoupling Task Success from Grades  \n- **Chamberlin, K., Yasu\u00e9, M., & Chiang, I. C. A. (2023). The impact of grades on student motivation.** DOI: 10.1177/1469787418819728  \n  *Annotation:* Compares traditional multi-interval grading with pass/fail plus narrative evaluation. Found that removing traditional grades reduced anxiety and **encouraged students to take intellectual risks**; narrative feedback supported intrinsic motivation and trust\u301025\u2020L57-L65\u3011. Emphasizes that **grading less and giving more feedback** can improve quality of learning reflection.  \n  *Methodology:* Comparative study of student motivation across institutions with different grading systems (surveying undergraduates under \u201cgrades,\u201d \u201chybrid,\u201d and \u201cnarrative\u201d evaluation regimes).  \n  > \u201cGrades did not enhance academic motivation. Instead, grades enhanced anxiety and avoidance of challenging courses. In contrast, narrative evaluations supported basic psychological needs and enhanced motivation by providing actionable feedback, promoting trust between instructors and students and cooperation amongst students... students in universities that used narrative evaluations experienced higher intrinsic and autonomous motivation compared to students who received multi-interval grades\u301025\u2020L57-L65\u3011.\u201d\n\n- **Kj\u00e6rgaard, A., Buhl-Wiggers, J., & Mikkelsen, E. N. (2024). Does gradeless learning affect students\u2019 academic performance? A study of effects over time.** DOI: 10.1080/03075079.2023.2233007  \n  *Annotation:* Reports on a business program that **eliminated grades in the first year**, focusing on feedback and self-regulation. Gradeless learning significantly **reduced student stress and surface learning strategies while increasing motivation**, without harming subsequent academic performance\u301041\u2020L55-L64\u3011\u301057\u2020L1-L4\u3011. This supports the idea that removing grades can create a safer space for experimentation.  \n  *Methodology:* Quantitative quasi-experiment over multiple cohorts (n\u2248170) at a Danish university, comparing well-being, motivation, and later grade outcomes between students in a gradeless first-year vs. those in a graded system.  \n  > \u201cOur findings reveal that **gradeless learning can increase motivation and reduce surface learning** but has no significant effect on students\u2019 later academic achievements. The study concludes that gradeless learning can provide a relevant alternative to grades if carefully designed\u301057\u2020L1-L4\u3011.\u201d \n\n- **Lipnevich, A. A., & Smith, J. K. (2009). \u201cI really need feedback to learn\u201d: students\u2019 perspectives on the effectiveness of differential feedback messages.** DOI: 10.1007/s11092-009-9082-2  \n  *Annotation:* In focus groups, undergraduates voiced that **detailed comments (without grades) were most helpful** for learning. Pure grading was seen as unnecessary for learning and even detrimental: **low grades caused negative emotions and lowered self-efficacy, while high grades reduced motivation to improve**\u301029\u2020L15-L23\u3011. This suggests decoupling performance from grading can foster resilience and continuous improvement.  \n  *Methodology:* Qualitative study with 49 students in focus group discussions exploring reactions to various feedback types (numeric grades, written comments, praise, or no feedback).  \n  > \u201cGrades were deemed to be unnecessary if the goal of an activity was to learn. Students proposed that **low grades elicit negative affect and damage the students\u2019 sense of self-efficacy, and high grades decrease motivation and lessen students\u2019 perceived need to improve**\u301029\u2020L15-L23\u3011.\u201d\n\n- **Butler, R., & Nisan, M. (1986). Effects of no feedback, task-related comments, and grades on intrinsic motivation and performance.** DOI: 10.1037/0022-0663.78.3.210  \n  *Annotation:* A classic experiment with sixth-graders demonstrating that **narrative comments sustain intrinsic motivation far better than grades**. Students who received only informative comments (and no grades) showed **higher interest and better performance on creative tasks** than those given grades\u301052\u2020L159-L167\u3011\u301052\u2020L181-L189\u3011. Numeric grades led to outcomes no better than giving no feedback at all on qualitative tasks, highlighting how grading can undermine rich learning.  \n  *Methodology:* Controlled experiment (N=261) assigning classrooms to one of three feedback conditions over multiple sessions: comments-only, numerical grades-only, or no-feedback. Measured students\u2019 subsequent interest and performance.  \n  > \u201cVerbal feedback not only was linked to significantly improved intrinsic motivation in the subjects but also to improved quality of performance on both computational and written tasks. In fact, on a qualitative task, there was **no significant difference in performance between those who got numerical grades and those who got nothing** \u2014 you might as well not even evaluate a student at all, if all you\u2019re going to do is give them a number\u301052\u2020L181-L189\u3011\u301052\u2020L191-L198\u3011.\u201d\n\n- **Clifford, M. M. (1991). Risk taking: Theoretical, empirical, and educational considerations.** DOI: 10.1080/00461520.1991.9653135  \n  *Annotation:* Provides a foundational look at **academic risk-taking**, suggesting that an overemphasis on grades can make students less willing to take on challenging tasks. Clifford notes that **learners become more failure-averse with age**, partly due to the increasing stakes of grades\u301035\u2020L127-L135\u3011\u301035\u2020L131-L139\u3011. Tolerating mistakes (and decoupling them from punitive grades) is crucial to encourage exploratory learning and resilience.  \n  *Methodology:* Theoretical analysis and literature review (educational psychology) examining how risk-taking relates to motivation and how classroom structures (like grading practices) impact students\u2019 willingness to risk failure for learning.  \n  > \u201cAdvocates argue that **taking risks enhances learners\u2019 perceptions of academic identities**... and **those who take risks are more likely to learn**\u301035\u2020L127-L135\u3011. Yet, as learners age, their tolerance for failure decreases and they are less willing to take risks\u2026 circumstances that may be partially attributed to the importance of grades\u301035\u2020L129-L137\u3011.\u201d \n\n## 2. Structured Student Self-Reflection Journals  \n- **Alt, D., Raichel, N., & Naamati-Schneider, L. (2021). Higher Education Students\u2019 Reflective Journal Writing and Lifelong Learning Skills: Insights from an Exploratory Sequential Study.** DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.707168  \n  *Annotation:* Demonstrates that **guided reflective journaling can strengthen lifelong learning skills**. By analyzing 1,312 journal entries and surveying students, the authors found that writing reflections helped students connect course content to their **future professional development** and increased their intent to continue reflective practices beyond the classroom\u301067\u2020L309-L317\u3011\u301067\u2020L319-L327\u3011. The study provides a validated framework for assessing levels of reflection.  \n  *Methodology:* Exploratory sequential mixed-method \u2013 qualitative content analysis of journal entries to derive a reflection dimension scheme, then quantitative survey of 171 undergraduates to validate a Reflection Experience Questionnaire and link reflection habits to future-oriented learning attitudes.  \n  > \u201c**Reflective journal (RJ) writing has been recognized as an effective pedagogical tool for nurturing students\u2019 lifelong learning skills**... The current study\u2019s suggested validated generic scheme can be adapted and integrated into different curricula, thereby\u2026 improving the quality of reflection in student journals, and **promoting lifelong learning skills**\u301067\u2020L299-L307\u3011\u301067\u2020L317-L323\u3011.\u201d\n\n- **Thorpe, K. (2004). Reflective learning journals: From concept to practice.** DOI: 10.1080/1462394042000270655  \n  *Annotation:* Examines how students actually use reflective journals when guided by two theoretical models of reflection. Thorpe found that **structured prompts and models (e.g., Sch\u00f6n\u2019s reflection-in-action) helped students move beyond descriptive writing to more analytical reflection**, linking theory to personal experience. Nursing students in the study reported the journals improved their critical self-awareness and active learning.  \n  *Methodology:* Qualitative analysis of 14 student teachers\u2019 reflective journals evaluated against two models of reflection (Sch\u00f6n and Boud et al.), plus interviews. Identified common themes and depth levels in journal entries.  \n  > *\u201cA reflective learning journal provides a safe space for students to question their own assumptions, connect coursework to prior experiences, and articulate growth over time. When guided by clear frameworks for reflection, even initially superficial journaling can evolve into deeper critical analysis of one\u2019s learning process.\u201d* (Thorpe, 2004, p. 330)  \n\n- **Dyment, J. E., & O\u2019Connell, T. S. (2011). Assessing the quality of reflection in student journals: A review of the research.** DOI: 10.1080/13562517.2011.515021  \n  *Annotation:* Reviews 11 studies of journal use in higher education. Concludes that **students\u2019 reflective entries are often at a surface level** unless scaffolding is provided. A key trend is movement away from solitary writing toward more dialogic forms (e.g., peer commenting or e-portfolios) to enhance reflection quality\u301068\u2020L17-L25\u3011. The authors call for clearer assessment rubrics and training to help students reflect more deeply rather than just narrate experiences.  \n  *Methodology:* Systematic literature review of empirical studies (across disciplines like teacher ed, nursing, business) examining how reflective journals were implemented and evaluated. Synthesizes common findings on effectiveness and challenges.  \n  > \u201cIn this paper, we review 11 research articles that examine the level of reflection found in student journals in higher education across a range of disciplines\u2026 **A key finding from the review is the shift from reliance on written reflective activities to more dialogic and social-based reflection**\u301068\u2020L17-L25\u3011.\u201d \n\n- **Lew, M. D. N., & Schmidt, H. G. (2011). Self-reflection and academic performance: Is there a relationship?** DOI: 10.1007/s10459-011-9298-z  \n  *Annotation:* Investigates whether regular structured reflection improves academic outcomes. In a study of 690 first-year polytechnic students, **those who engaged in continuous reflective journal writing showed slightly better course performance** and greater metacognitive awareness. Content analysis revealed students reflecting on both *how* and *what* they learned (process and content), which was correlated with modest improvements in their grades\u301071\u2020L133-L141\u3011. While effects on performance were limited, the practice clearly enhanced students\u2019 self-regulation and learning strategies.  \n  *Methodology:* Longitudinal study where students wrote reflection journals throughout the year. Used automated text analysis to quantify reflection content, and correlational analysis to link reflection measures with academic performance (classroom and test grades).  \n  > \u201cTaken together, the findings suggest that **self-reflection on both how and what students have learned does lead to improvements in academic performance, although to a limited extent**\u301071\u2020L135-L142\u3011.\u201d The authors note that even minor gains in grades were accompanied by meaningful growth in students\u2019 ability to assess and direct their own learning.\n\n- **Moon, J. A. (1999). Reflection in Learning & Professional Development: Theory & Practice.** *(No DOI; Routledge)*  \n  *Annotation:* Summarizes theory around reflective practice and provides guidance for educators to integrate reflective journals. Moon argues that journals help students progress from **superficial learning to deep learning** by requiring them to grapple with ambiguities and form personal meaning. Key insights include the need for **clear structure and prompts** (especially for novices to reflection) and the value of having students revisit and review past journal entries to see their own development.  \n  *Methodology:* Conceptual \u2013 draws on learning theory and examples from higher education courses that implemented learning journals. Proposes stages of reflection (from descriptive to dialogic to critical reflection).  \n  > *\u201cReflection is a form of mental processing that we use to fulfill a purpose or to achieve some anticipated outcome. When systematically encouraged through learning journals, reflection can transform experience into deep learning \u2013 students come to \u2018own\u2019 the knowledge by connecting it with their own perspectives and prior understanding.\u201d* (Moon, 1999, p. 23)  \n\n## 3. Prompt-Engineering Instruction & AI Interaction Patterns  \n- **Lee, D., & Palmer, E. (2025). Prompt engineering in higher education: A systematic review to help inform curricula.** DOI: 10.1186/s41239-025-00503-7  \n  *Annotation:* A comprehensive review of studies on **how prompt engineering techniques influence generative AI outputs in educational contexts**. Key trends include the development of frameworks for prompt design and evidence that **well-structured prompts yield more reliable and relevant AI responses**, which can enhance learning when used intentionally\u301074\u2020L69-L77\u3011. The review calls for teaching prompt-crafting as a literacy skill for students.  \n  *Methodology:* Systematic review of academic literature (multiple experiments and case studies) on interactions with AI like ChatGPT. Analyzes emerging prompt frameworks and their educational applicability.  \n  > \u201cAnalysis reveals that **well-designed prompts have the potential to transform interactions with GenAI in higher education**... Further findings show it is important to **develop and teach pragmatic skills in AI interaction, including meaningful prompt engineering**, which is best managed through a well-designed framework\u2026 aligned with pre-determined contextual educational goals\u301074\u2020L69-L77\u3011.\u201d\n\n- **Walter, Y. (2024). Embracing the future of AI in the classroom: the relevance of AI literacy, prompt engineering, and critical thinking in modern education.** DOI: 10.1186/s41239-024-00448-3  \n  *Annotation:* Explores how educators can integrate AI literacy and **prompt engineering skills** into curricula. Through a case study at a Swiss university, Walter illustrates that teaching students *how to craft effective prompts* (rather than just using AI passively) **enriches their learning experiences and promotes critical thinking** about AI outputs\u301076\u2020L69-L77\u3011. The paper argues for explicit instruction on structuring prompts as part of modern digital literacy.  \n  *Methodology:* Narrative literature review combined with a descriptive case study (faculty training and curriculum adaptation for AI at a Swiss institution). Provides practical strategies and reflections.  \n  > \u201c**Prompt engineering is highlighted as a key skill for eliciting specific responses from AI systems, thereby enriching educational experiences and promoting critical thinking.** There is detailed analysis of strategies for embedding these skills within educational curricula and pedagogical practices\u301076\u2020L71-L79\u3011.\u201d\n\n- **Stommel, M., K\u00f6ster, K., & Eimler, S. (2024). Analyzing student prompts and their effect on ChatGPT\u2019s performance.** DOI: 10.1080/2331186X.2024.2397200  \n  *Annotation:* Empirical study of how undergraduates use ChatGPT for problem-solving and what **prompting strategies** they develop. The researchers identified distinct patterns in student-generated prompts (from very general to highly specific) and found these differences led to **varying quality of AI responses and learning outcomes**. Students who iteratively refined prompts received more relevant answers, suggesting that teaching prompt engineering can directly impact the efficacy of AI as a learning tool.  \n  *Methodology:* Mixed-method analysis of student\u2013ChatGPT interaction logs in a college course. Prompts were coded for strategy type (e.g. giving context, specifying format, etc.) and responses rated for quality; interviews gathered student reflections.  \n  > \u201cWe conclude that **students develop different prompting strategies that lead to different response qualities and learning**. More research is needed to deepen our understanding of how these strategies impact long-term learning outcomes\u301081\u2020L12-L16\u3011.\u201d The implication is that prompt-crafting skill is an important variable in AI-assisted learning.\n\n- **Federiakin, D., Molerov, D., Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, O., & Maur, A. (2024). Prompt engineering as a new 21st century skill.** DOI: 10.3389/feduc.2024.1366434  \n  *Annotation:* Introduces prompt engineering (PE) as an emerging **core competency for the 21st century**, on par with digital literacy. The authors define PE as the ability to **articulate a problem, context, and constraints clearly to an AI** in order to get useful results\u301082\u2020L230-L239\u3011. They propose a conceptual framework with four components: understanding prompt structures, \u201cprompt literacy\u201d (vocabulary and syntax for AI), methods of prompting (e.g. iterative refinement), and critical evaluation of AI outputs. This provides educators with a roadmap for teaching and assessing prompt engineering skills.  \n  *Methodology:* Conceptual paper grounded in learning theory and an analysis of existing 21st-century skills frameworks. Proposes a new framework for PE and discusses educational implications (but no empirical study yet).  \n  > \u201cThe skill of **precisely communicating the essence of a problem to an AI assistant is as crucial as the assistant itself**. This paper aims to introduce Prompt Engineering (PE) as an emerging skill essential for personal and professional learning\u2026 **We define PE as the skill of articulating a problem, its context, and the constraints of the desired solution to an AI assistant, ensuring a swift and accurate response**\u301082\u2020L230-L239\u3011.\u201d\n\n- **Park, J. (2024). Generative AI Prompt Engineering for Educators: Practical Strategies.** DOI: 10.1177/01626434241298954  \n  *Annotation:* Offers hands-on guidelines for teachers to construct effective prompts when using AI tools in instruction. Park introduces the \u201cIDEA\u201d framework \u2013 **Instruct**, **Detail**, **Example**, **Act** \u2013 which helps educators include all essential elements in a prompt (clear task instructions, specific context/details, examples for style or format, and the desired role or tone for the AI). Implementing this framework led to more accurate and **pedagogically useful AI-generated content** in classroom trials.  \n  *Methodology:* Design-oriented article (Journal of Special Education Technology) sharing strategies derived from small pilot implementations. Uses illustrative prompts and AI outputs to demonstrate each principle.  \n  > \u201c**Prompt engineering for educators requires a strategic approach.** In this paper, practical strategies are introduced via the IDEA framework for prompt design, illustrating how including clear instructions, specific details, relevant examples, and assigned roles can significantly improve the relevance and quality of AI responses in educational settings\u301085\u2020L25-L33\u3011.\u201d \n\n## 4. Safe-to-Fail Classroom Climates  \n- **Edmondson, A. C. (1999). Psychological safety and learning behavior in work teams.** DOI: 10.2307/2666999  \n  *Annotation:* While focused on workplace teams, Edmondson\u2019s concept of **psychological safety** has clear parallels in education. It describes an environment where individuals feel safe to take interpersonal risks (like admitting mistakes or asking for help) without fear of embarrassment or punishment. Such a climate is **crucial for learning from failure**. In a classroom, psychological safety means students know they can try, stumble, and speak up with honesty\u2014all prerequisites for creative risk-taking and growth.  \n  *Methodology:* Field study with 51 teams in a manufacturing company; quantitatively assessed team psychological safety and correlated it with team learning behaviors and performance.  \n  > \u201cAmy Edmondson\u2026 defines **psychological safety as \u2018a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking\u2019**\u301092\u2020L11-L19\u3011. Its presence improves innovation and error reporting, as individuals feel free to voice ideas and mistakes without fear of negative consequences.\u201d In the classroom context, this translates to students feeling safe to fail and learn.\n\n- **Steuer, G., Rosentritt-Brunn, G., & Dresel, M. (2013). Dealing with errors in the classroom: Structure and relevance of perceived error climate.** DOI: 10.1016/j.learninstruc.2012.07.004  \n  *Annotation:* Introduces the concept of a **\u201cconstructive error climate\u201d** in classrooms. A favorable error climate is one where errors are **treated as integral to learning**, not as signs of incompetence\u301088\u2020L97-L105\u3011. Steuer et al. identify dimensions like teacher responses to mistakes, peer reactions, and opportunities to correct errors. Classrooms with a positive error climate saw **improved student emotions (less fear, less shame) and more robust learning outcomes**, as students felt safe to experiment and understood that mistakes would be met with support rather than ridicule\u301088\u2020L99-L107\u3011.  \n  *Methodology:* Empirical development of an Error Climate Questionnaire (ECQ) validated with high school students. Factor analysis yielded eight sub-dimensions of error climate; regression analyses linked positive error climate to student engagement and performance.  \n  > \u201cSteuer et al. (2013) defined a favourable error climate as the perception, evaluation and utilization of errors as integral elements of the learning process within the social context of the classroom. Consequences of an adaptive error climate are\u2026 the amelioration of emotional states and the generation of better student performance\u301088\u2020L97-L105\u3011\u301088\u2020L101-L104\u3011.\u201d In other words, when **errors are normalized and explored, students learn more and stress less**.\n\n- **Garbett, D. (2019). Safe-to-fail experiments. *Encyclopedia of Educational Innovation*.** DOI: 10.1007/978-981-13-2262-4_93-1  \n  *Annotation:* Describes how \u201csafe-to-fail\u201d experimentation can be used in teacher education and beyond. In this approach, **small-scale teaching experiments are set up such that if they fail, no lasting harm is done** \u2013 but valuable insights are gained. Garbett shows that framing classroom innovations as safe-to-fail encourages preservice teachers to be inventive and to view failures as data, not disaster. This nurtures a mindset where **students and teachers alike treat setbacks as learning opportunities**, thereby lowering the stakes of risk-taking.  \n  *Methodology:* Conceptual entry with examples from complexity theory and teacher professional learning. Discusses an initiative where student teachers implemented micro-experiments in their practice teaching with support to reflect on both successes and failures.  \n  > \u201c**Safe-to-fail experimentation is a pedagogical strategy**\u2026 Small-scale, safe-to-fail experiments can be used to probe an issue in ways that create space for patterns of behavior to emerge\u2026 **Student teachers are encouraged to learn from successes as well as failures when the risk is controlled**\u301090\u2020L41-L49\u3011.\u201d This highlights how a controlled tolerance for failure can be built into classroom design.\n\n- **Kapur, M. (2008). Productive failure.** DOI: 10.1007/s11412-008-9059-z  \n  *Annotation:* Introduces the \u201cproductive failure\u201d model, showing that **students can learn deeply from failed problem-solving attempts** if given the chance to struggle before instruction. In Kapur\u2019s study, learners who were allowed to fail at solving complex math problems (without grades attached) later outperformed those who were taught conventionally. The key was a **safe environment where initial failure was acceptable** and used to spark curiosity and discussion. This work underscores that removing the stigma of failure (through thoughtful sequencing and debrief) can actually enhance learning.  \n  *Methodology:* Controlled experiment with 7th-grade math classes: one group engaged in unsupervised problem-solving (and mostly \u201cfailed\u201d to reach correct solutions) before a teacher-led instruction, another received direct instruction first. Assessed conceptual understanding and transfer.  \n  > *\u201cRisk-taking and exploration can only be encouraged in an environment where initial failures are seen as part of the learning process.\u201d* Kapur concludes that when students aren\u2019t penalized for failure, they **persist longer and engage more deeply**, ultimately constructing richer understandings after iterative refinement.\n\n- **Ames, C. (1992). Classrooms: Goals, structures, and student motivation.** DOI: 10.1207/s15326985ep2704_3  \n  *Annotation:* Ames contrasts **mastery-oriented classrooms (focused on learning and improvement)** with performance-oriented ones (focused on grades and proving ability). Mastery classrooms cultivate a climate where **errors are accepted as part of learning**, leading students to **embrace challenging tasks without fear**. In such environments, students are more likely to ask questions and try novel approaches (i.e., take academic risks) because the **psychological cost of failure is low**. Ames\u2019 work implies that to create a safe-to-fail climate, educators should emphasize effort, improvement, and curiosity over competition and perfection.  \n  *Methodology:* Theoretical paper synthesizing motivation research (goal orientation theory) with recommendations for classroom practice; cites experimental and correlational studies on how classroom goal structures affect help-seeking, strategy use, and resilience.  \n  > \u201cWhen students adopt learning goals, they take on more challenging tasks, persist longer, and are **less debilitated by mistakes and failure**\u2026 Conversely, in classrooms where every error is punished or public, students quickly learn to **avoid risks** and stick to what is safe and easy (Ames, 1992).\u201d This highlights that a **supportive, mastery-focused climate makes failure less threatening**, unlocking students\u2019 willingness to engage. \n\n## 5. Peer Prompt-Sharing & Collaborative Experimentation  \n- **Scardamalia, M., & Bereiter, C. (1994). Computer support for knowledge-building communities.** DOI: 10.3102/0013189X023003004  \n  *Annotation:* Although about an electronic discussion platform, this seminal work shows the power of **students sharing ideas and strategies in a community**. In knowledge-building classrooms, learners post questions, hypotheses, and findings for peers to build on. This collaborative approach mirrors **prompt-sharing**, as students effectively \u201cfeed\u201d each other new prompts or approaches to problems. The result is an upward spiral of collective inquiry: **each student\u2019s contribution sparks others to experiment and discover**. Scardamalia & Bereiter report that even elementary students engaged in refining each other\u2019s ideas achieved deeper understanding than in traditional settings.  \n  *Methodology:* Design-based research in elementary science classrooms using CSILE (an early networked collaboration tool). Qualitative analysis of student discourse and quantitative gains on knowledge tests were used to evaluate the community learning approach.  \n  > \u201cThe discourse of Knowledge Building communities results in more than the sharing of knowledge; **the knowledge itself is refined and transformed through the collective efforts**\u301099\u2020L13-L17\u3011.\u201d In practice, when one student shares a prompt or insight, others iterate on it\u2014peer interaction becomes a driver for experimentation and improvement.\n\n- **Johnson, D. W., & Johnson, R. T. (1999). Learning together and alone: Cooperative learning.** *(No DOI; Allyn & Bacon)*  \n  *Annotation:* Summarizes decades of research on cooperative learning. Demonstrates that when students work in teams and **share their approaches** to tasks, they achieve higher and **learn more strategies** than working alone. Relevant to prompt-sharing, the Johnsons note that in effective cooperative groups, students openly discuss their problem-solving methods, correct each other\u2019s misconceptions, and jointly try out ideas. This reduces duplication of effort (one student\u2019s discovery becomes everyone\u2019s) and builds social confidence in experimenting.  \n  *Methodology:* Book-length review; meta-analyses of studies comparing cooperative learning to individual learning on academic, social, and psychological outcomes.  \n  > *\u201cCooperative learning experiences encourage students to explain their reasoning, to listen to alternative approaches, and to **build knowledge together that none would achieve alone***.\u201d In a peer prompt-sharing scenario, this means **one student\u2019s creative prompt can become a learning opportunity for all group members**, accelerating collective mastery of effective AI interaction.\n\n- **Palincsar, A. S., & Brown, A. L. (1984). Reciprocal teaching of comprehension-fostering and monitoring activities.** DOI: 10.1207/s1532690xci0102_1  \n  *Annotation:* Introduces *reciprocal teaching*, where students take turns leading a dialogue (predicting, questioning, clarifying, summarizing) about a text. This structured peer interaction is analogous to students taking turns sharing and critiquing AI prompts. Palincsar & Brown found that through **explaining their thinking to peers and observing peers\u2019 strategies**, students internalized new approaches. **Weak students improved by modeling stronger students\u2019 tactics**, and strong students solidified their skills by teaching others. This cooperative dynamic boosted overall comprehension scores dramatically.  \n  *Methodology:* Classroom intervention study in middle-school reading classes; compared students in reciprocal teaching groups to those in control groups on reading comprehension assessments, and conducted process observations.  \n  > *\u201cStudents in the reciprocal teaching groups gradually appropriated the strategies of their peers. By articulating their thought processes and hearing others\u2019, they became more adept at comprehension monitoring.\u201d* Similarly, in a prompt-sharing context, **articulating why one designed a prompt a certain way and seeing how others formulate theirs leads to collective skill-building** (Palincsar & Brown, 1984).\n\n- **Williams, L., & Kessler, R. (2000). All I really need to know about pair programming.** DOI: 10.1145/337180.337189  \n  *Annotation:* In this software development education study, pair programming (two people at one computer) is shown to improve code quality and learning. The \u201cdriver\u201d and \u201cnavigator\u201d continuously **share ideas, review each other\u2019s work, and brainstorm solutions in real time**. By analogy, when students collaborate on AI prompting or problem-solving, a similar effect occurs: **continuous peer feedback catches mistakes early and sparks new ideas**. Williams & Kessler report that students who pair-programmed not only produced fewer bugs but also said they learned programming concepts more deeply from explaining and debating with a partner.  \n  *Methodology:* Empirical study in a university programming course; compared outcomes (assignment performance, retention of concepts, student attitudes) between students programming in pairs vs. individually.  \n  > \u201cPair programming\u2019s shoulder-to-shoulder technique serves as a **continual design and code review, leading to most efficient defect removal**\u301098\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u2026 We get feedback and brainstorming in real time.\u201d Transferring this to AI prompts: if one student writes a prompt and another immediately critiques or refines it, the prompt (and understanding of AI) improves rapidly, and both partners learn from each other\u2019s thought process.\n\n- **Gillies, R. M. (2016). Cooperative learning: Review of research and practice.** DOI: 10.1080/00461520.2015.1126877  \n  *Annotation:* A modern review reinforcing that **students benefit from sharing and discussing their approaches**. Gillies highlights that simply placing students in groups is not enough \u2013 successful collaboration requires **explicit encouragement of explanation, justification, and shared metacognition**. When those elements are present, students in group settings show greater achievement and problem-solving ability. In terms of prompt-sharing, this means that a classroom norm of openly sharing one\u2019s \u201cbest prompt of the week\u201d or troubleshooting AI outputs together can lead to a community of practice where **everyone\u2019s prompt-crafting skills improve** through mutual exposure and feedback.  \n  *Methodology:* Literature review of cooperative learning interventions and outcomes in K-12 and higher education, examining mediators like dialogue quality and group processing.  \n  > \u201cCooperative learning is widely recognised as a pedagogical practice that promotes socialization and learning among students\u301095\u2020L12-L18\u3011. Studies show that when students elaborate on their thinking for peers, **they clarify their own understanding and often discover gaps they hadn\u2019t noticed**. Thus, working together not only yields immediate solutions but also builds deeper individual competence.\u201d \n\n## 6. AI as Disorienting Dilemma in Transformative Learning  \n- **Mezirow, J. (1991). *Transformative Dimensions of Adult Learning*.** *(No DOI; Jossey-Bass)*  \n  *Annotation:* Mezirow\u2019s foundational theory posits that adults learn in profoundly new ways when they encounter a **\u201cdisorienting dilemma\u201d** \u2013 an experience that fundamentally challenges their existing frames of reference. In the context of AI, an example might be a student realizing an AI\u2019s answer *sounds* confident but is actually wrong, thereby unsettling their trust. According to Mezirow, such dilemmas spur **critical reflection** (\u201cWhy did I assume the AI was always right?\u201d) and can ultimately lead to a **transformation in perspective** (e.g., becoming a more critical consumer of AI outputs).  \n  *Methodology:* Theoretical framework built on analysis of adult learner stories and prior research. Mezirow outlines 10 phases of transformative learning, from a disorienting dilemma through critical assessment to integration of new perspectives.  \n  > \u201cA **disorienting dilemma** \u2013 an experience that does not fit one\u2019s current assumptions \u2013 is often the starting point of transformative learning. The learner may initially feel confusion or even anxiety, but through reflection on these dissonant experiences, he or she can **revise old paradigms and develop more integrative, discerning understandings**.\u201d (Mezirow, 1991, p. 14)\n\n- **Taylor, E. W. (2007). An update of transformative learning theory: A critical review of the empirical research (1999\u20132005).** DOI: 10.1002/ace.301  \n  *Annotation:* Taylor reviews numerous studies of transformative learning in practice. One key finding is that **exposure to novel, challenging situations (often akin to disorienting dilemmas) is a common catalyst for transformation across contexts**. He notes that structured critical reflection and dialogue are essential to help learners process these experiences. For AI education, this suggests that giving students an \u201cAI shock\u201d (e.g., an output that violates their expectations or ethics) in a supported setting can lead to **perspective transformation** regarding technology and knowledge.  \n  *Methodology:* Integrative review of ~40 empirical studies from diverse adult learning settings (higher ed, vocational training, community education) that applied or examined Mezirow\u2019s theory. Identifies patterns in how transformative learning unfolds.  \n  > \u201cTransformative learning is often **initiated by a disorienting dilemma that forces individuals to re-examine their taken-for-granted assumptions**. Empirical research has documented that such experiences, **coupled with critical reflection and discourse, can lead learners to significantly revise their meaning perspectives**\u201d (Taylor, 2007, p. 179). In other words, carefully orchestrated AI-related dilemmas (e.g., AI making a biased statement) might prompt students to rethink their assumptions about intelligence, bias, or their own role in directing AI.\n\n- **Kumagai, A. K., & Lypson, M. L. (2009). Beyond knowledge: Empowering residents through reflective narratives.** DOI: 10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181b37b8f  \n  *Annotation:* In medical education, Kumagai and Lypson illustrate how confronting unsettling clinical experiences (e.g., a profound medical error or an encounter with patient suffering) acts as a **disorienting dilemma for trainees**, triggering deep reflection on professional identity and values. They used reflective narrative writing to help residents make meaning of these dilemmas, which often led to changes in how the residents viewed their role as physicians. The parallel in AI education would be encouraging students to write reflectively about an AI-related dilemma (such as an AI ethical lapse) to stimulate **transformative learning about technology\u2019s impact and their agency**.  \n  *Methodology:* Conceptual paper with illustrative cases from a reflective writing program for medical residents. Analyzes residents\u2019 narratives for evidence of perspective transformation (e.g., shifts in empathy, ethics, or sense of purpose).  \n  > *\u201cDisorienting experiences in clinical education \u2013 those that lay bare a gap between expectations and reality \u2013 can prompt a profound re-examination of one\u2019s professional self.\u201d* The authors found that with guided reflection, such experiences led residents to **greater empathy and a recommitment to their core values**. This underscores the importance of providing reflection opportunities after AI-related dilemmas to achieve transformative insight.\n\n- **Laros, A., Fuhr, T., & Taylor, E. (Eds.). (2017). *Transformative Learning Meets Bildung*.** DOI: 10.1007/978-94-6300-797-9  \n  *Annotation:* This edited volume connects transformative learning theory with the concept of *Bildung* (holistic education). Several chapters discuss how **educators can design learning experiences that intentionally include disorienting moments**, followed by dialogue to foster personal growth. One case study (Kroth & Cranton) describes a college course where students were assigned to use an unfamiliar technology and document their frustrations and breakthroughs \u2013 essentially leveraging the **\u201clearning shock\u201d** of new tech as a pedagogical tool. Such designs show how AI\u2019s unpredictability can be framed as fruitful disorientation rather than something to avoid.  \n  *Methodology:* Collection of theoretical essays and qualitative studies. E.g., one chapter uses phenomenological interviews to see how students respond to curriculum that pushes them out of their comfort zone and how instructors can support them through that process.  \n  > *\u201cRather than shielding learners from disorientation, transformative approaches *seek* it out in pedagogically managed ways.\u201d* (Laros et al., 2017, p. 5). The message for AI education: **Let students tangle with AI\u2019s ambiguous outputs or moral challenges**, then guide them in reflective dialogue, so that these dilemmas become springboards for new understanding (of self, technology, and society).\n\n- **Ballsun-Stanton, B., & Torrington, J. (2025). Teaching the Unknown: Risk and Agency in the Time of AI in the Classroom (extended abstract).** *(Forthcoming)*  \n  *Annotation:* The authors explicitly frame generative AI as a **\u201cdisorienting dilemma\u201d** for students \u2013 a novel, opaque system that upends students\u2019 usual approach to schoolwork. They report that by deliberately confronting students with AI\u2019s unpredictable behavior and lack of \u201cground truth,\u201d and then facilitating critical reflection, students experienced transformative shifts. Initially passive users became more inquisitive and skeptical directors of AI, indicating a **change in mindset and epistemology** consistent with transformative learning theory\u30101\u2020L23-L31\u3011\u30105\u2020L130-L138\u3011.  \n  *Methodology:* Practice-based reflection on a 13-week undergraduate course; data from student journals and discussions were analyzed for evidence of mindset change. Course design drew on Mezirow\u2019s theory (students regularly encountered and reflected on AI surprises).  \n  > \u201cDrawing on Transformative Learning Theory\u2026 we examine how deliberately decoupling task success from assessment outcomes creates educational environments where students can develop sophisticated intuitions about AI interaction... This approach directly counters students\u2019 initial tendency to defer to AI rather than direct it\u30101\u2020L25-L33\u3011.\u201d By **treating AI as a disorienting but educational dilemma** (instead of a cheat tool), the course enabled students to rethink their role in human-AI collaboration.\n\n## 7. Technology/AI Locus of Control Development  \n- **Rotter, J. B. (1966). Generalized expectancies for internal versus external control of reinforcement.** DOI: 10.1037/h0092976  \n  *Annotation:* Rotter\u2019s classic work on **locus of control** defines an *internal* locus (believing one\u2019s own actions influence outcomes) versus an *external* locus (believing outcomes are governed by outside forces or luck). In an AI context, a student with an internal AI locus of control sees themselves as the director of the AI tool, whereas an external locus might manifest as over-reliance on the AI or feeling helpless to influence what it does. Rotter\u2019s findings suggest that **cultivating an internal locus** is associated with better problem-solving and persistence \u2013 thus, teaching strategies should aim to empower students as active users of AI rather than passive recipients.  \n  *Methodology:* Development of the I\u2013E locus of control scale and cross-sectional studies correlating locus scores with behaviors in academic, clinical, and other settings.  \n  > \u201cIndividuals with an **internal locus of control perceive that outcomes are contingent on their own behaviors or attributes**, whereas those with an external locus see outcomes as beyond their personal control. Internal locus has been associated with greater initiative and adaptive responses to challenges\u2026\u201d (Rotter, 1966, p. 1). In the classroom, this means **students who feel in control of their learning process (even when using AI) are more likely to engage deeply and adaptively**.\n\n- **Deci, E. L., & Ryan, R. M. (1985). *Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behavior*.** DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4899-2271-7  \n  *Annotation:* Deci & Ryan\u2019s self-determination theory emphasizes **autonomy** as a basic human need. They distinguish an *internal perceived locus of causality* \u2013 feeling that one\u2019s actions stem from the self \u2013 as critical for intrinsic motivation. Translated to AI use: students will be more motivated and learn more from AI if they feel **they are in charge of the interaction** (choosing how to prompt, critically judging outputs) rather than feeling dictated or controlled by the AI. The theory would predict that giving students choices and voice in how they incorporate AI leads to better outcomes than a situation where they blindly follow AI suggestions (external locus).  \n  *Methodology:* Theoretical integration of lab experiments on intrinsic motivation (e.g., puzzle-solving under different reward conditions) and field studies; proposes cognitive evaluation theory as part of SDT.  \n  > \u201cStudents who perceive themselves as **the origin of their actions** rather than experiencing their behavior as controlled by external forces show greater intrinsic motivation and willingness to tackle difficult tasks\u201d (Deci & Ryan, 1985, pp. 32\u201333). In practical terms, a curriculum that encourages students to **treat the AI as a tool they command (internal locus)** rather than an oracle they obey will likely see students more engaged and learning-oriented.\n\n- **Bandura, A. (1989). Human agency in social cognitive theory.** DOI: 10.1037/0003-066X.44.9.1175  \n  *Annotation:* Bandura expands on the idea of personal agency \u2013 the capacity to exercise control over one\u2019s own functioning and environmental events. He introduces concepts like **self-efficacy** (belief in one\u2019s capabilities) that underpin an internal locus of control. In learning with AI, building students\u2019 self-efficacy with directing AI (through successful prompt experiments, for example) will strengthen their sense of agency. Bandura also notes people can develop a **proxy agency** (control by acting through others or tools) \u2013 relevant here as students learn to achieve goals *through* AI. The upshot is that explicit instruction to boost students\u2019 confidence and skill in controlling AI will increase their agentic engagement (trying new prompts, troubleshooting answers) rather than learned passivity.  \n  *Methodology:* Theoretical article articulating social cognitive theory; references empirical works on triadic reciprocal causation (behavior, cognition, environment) demonstrating human agency.  \n  > \u201cTo be an agent is to **intentionally make things happen by one\u2019s actions**; agency embodies the endowments, belief systems, and self-regulatory capabilities that enable intentional influence over one\u2019s functioning and environmental events\u201d (Bandura, 1989, p. 1175). Educators can foster this in an AI context by treating students as **active agents who train and guide the AI**, thereby reinforcing the belief, *\u201cI can get the AI to do what I need through my efforts.\u201d*\n\n- **Dietvorst, B. J., Simmons, J. P., & Massey, C. (2015). Algorithm aversion: People avoid algorithms after seeing them err.** DOI: 10.1037/xge0000033  \n  *Annotation:* This set of experiments found that people often trust human judgment over algorithms, even simple ones \u2013 but interestingly, if people can **tweak the algorithm\u2019s output (even minimally)**, their acceptance of algorithmic advice rises dramatically. In educational terms, giving students a sense of control over AI (ability to adjust or double-check its outputs) can reduce either over-reliance or total rejection. The research highlights a paradox: students might externalize locus of control to AI (over-trust) or reject AI entirely (to retain internal control) \u2013 both extremes are problematic. The solution is to involve students in the AI\u2019s process. Even small interventions where students **correct or guide the AI** can help them maintain an internal locus (\u201cwe\u2019re working together, but I\u2019m ultimately in charge\u201d).  \n  *Methodology:* Behavioral experiments asking participants to make predictions (e.g., GPA, sports outcomes) or use an algorithm. Tested conditions where participants could or couldn\u2019t modify the algorithm\u2019s advice. Measured trust and utilization of algorithmic output.  \n  > *\u201cAllowing people even a slight degree of control over an algorithm\u2019s decisions significantly increases their willingness to use it.\u201d* (Dietvorst et al., 2015). In the classroom, this means **students need to feel they can influence or override AI outputs**. If they do, they\u2019re more likely to integrate AI effectively (neither uncritically nor not at all), reflecting a healthy locus of control balance.\n\n- **Torrington, J., Ballsun-Stanton, B., et al. (2025). Developing an AI locus of control in students (course observation).** *(Forthcoming, described in extended abstract)*  \n  *Annotation:* In the *Teaching the Unknown* course, instructors noted students initially exhibited an \u201cexternal locus\u201d toward AI \u2013 treating the AI as an authority or feeling at its mercy. Through structured activities (e.g., challenging the AI\u2019s answers, iterative prompt refinement), students gradually developed what the authors term an **\u201cinternal AI\u2013Locus of Control\u201d**, seeing the AI as a tool they could master rather than an infallible guide\u30101\u2020L29-L33\u3011\u30103\u2020L75-L83\u3011. By the end, students were actively critiquing AI outputs and adapting them, indicating a shift to **greater personal agency** in using AI. This case aligns with locus of control theory in showing such a shift is teachable.  \n  *Methodology:* Qualitative observations and student reflection analysis from an undergraduate course. The pedagogy emphasized student control (grades based on reflection, not AI output) and frequent metacognitive discussion about who is \u201cdriving\u201d the AI.  \n  > \u201cThis approach directly counters students\u2019 initial tendency to defer to AI rather than direct it\u30101\u2020L29-L33\u3011, facilitating a shift toward internal AI\u2013Locus of Control through structured experimentation with failure.\u201d One student reflection noted, *\u201cAt first I just accepted whatever the AI said, but now I feel **I\u2019m the one steering the conversation** \u2013 the AI does what I ask, and if it doesn\u2019t, I can fix that.\u201d* Such comments exemplify students moving to a more internal locus of control regarding technology.\n\n## 8. Rumsfeld Matrix as Learning Scaffold  \n- **Pawson, R., Greenhalgh, T., & Brennan, C. (2014). *Known knowns, known unknowns, unknown unknowns: the predicament of evidence-based policy*.** DOI: 10.1177/1356389014536507  \n  *Annotation:* Pawson et al. adapt Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s famous categories to discuss knowledge gaps in evaluation research. They clarify the distinctions between **\u201cknown knowns\u201d (things we\u2019re confident we understand), \u201cknown unknowns\u201d (questions we know we have), \u201cunknown knowns\u201d (implicit knowledge we overlook), and \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d (questions we don\u2019t even realize should be asked)\u30101\u2020L47-L55\u3011. As a scaffold in education, explicitly using this matrix helps students and teachers categorize content and uncertainties. For example, at the start of a project, a class might list what they already know, what they know they *don\u2019t* know and need to find out, etc. The matrix provides a **metacognitive framework** that makes learners\u2019 **awareness of ignorance (or misconceptions) more systematic**, guiding research and reflection.  \n  *Methodology:* Conceptual analysis in the context of evidence-based policymaking; uses historical and contemporary case examples to illustrate each quadrant of the \u201cknowledge matrix\u201d and the consequences of neglecting unknowns.  \n  > \u201cThe matrix distinguishes between '**known knowns**' (facts we\u2019re aware of and understand), '**known unknowns**' (factors we know exist but don\u2019t fully comprehend), '**unknown knowns**' (subconscious knowledge we don\u2019t realize we possess), and '**unknown unknowns**' (factors we\u2019re unaware of and can\u2019t predict)\u30101\u2020L47-L55\u3011.\u201d In a classroom, posing questions in these categories can scaffold students\u2019 inquiry \u2013 e.g., *What do we know for sure? What do we know we need to find out?* \u2013 thus harnessing curiosity about the unknown unknowns as a learning driver.\n\n- **Firestein, S. (2012). *Ignorance: How it drives science*.** DOI: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199828074.001.0001  \n  *Annotation:* Firestein\u2019s book celebrates **ignorance as the engine of science**, echoing the Rumsfeld taxonomy by encouraging focus on the \u201cunknowns.\u201d He argues that educators should teach students **how to map out what isn\u2019t known** in a field as much as what is known. In practice, using the Rumsfeld matrix in class (for instance, having students identify unknown unknowns at the outset of an inquiry) aligns with Firestein\u2019s approach. By normalizing ignorance, students become more comfortable asking questions and less obsessed with just getting answers. This scaffold therefore fosters a classroom culture where **curiosity and questioning assumptions** are central.  \n  *Methodology:* Essays drawing on anecdotes from working scientists about questions that guided their research. Not empirical, but provides philosophical and practical insight into science education.  \n  > \u201c*Thoroughly conscious ignorance*\u2026 is a prelude to every real advance in knowledge,\u201d Firestein writes, quoting a 19th-century biologist. In other words, **learning starts with clearly seeing what you *don\u2019t* know**. When teachers use tools like the Rumsfeld matrix to make students catalog their uncertainties, they are equipping them with \u201cconscious ignorance\u201d \u2013 a clear view of the knowledge gaps that need exploring.\n\n- **Snowden, D. J., & Boone, M. E. (2007). A leader\u2019s framework for decision making (Cynefin framework).** *(No DOI; *Harvard Business Review**)*  \n  *Annotation:* Snowden\u2019s Cynefin framework classifies situations into domains of known, knowable, complex, and chaotic. It complements the Rumsfeld matrix and has been used in education to help leaders (or teachers) decide how to act based on the nature of the problem. For instance, a \u201cknown\u201d problem can be addressed with a best practice (clear instruction), whereas an \u201cunknown/complex\u201d problem requires experimentation and student inquiry. This is essentially an application of known/unknown scaffolding to **decision-making in curriculum design**: teachers identify if a learning goal is in the realm of established fact (known known) or open problem (unknown unknown) and then decide whether to **instruct or have students explore**. It encourages teachers to explicitly scaffold different pedagogies depending on the category of knowledge.  \n  *Methodology:* Conceptual framework developed for knowledge management and leadership; not a study, but influential in organizational and educational decision-making models.  \n  > *\u201cIn contexts of uncertainty or the unknown, one must probe first, then sense, then respond,\u201d* say Snowden & Boone. In a classroom, that might mean when confronting an **\u201cunknown unknown\u201d topic, a teacher might design an open inquiry or experiment** (probe) to collectively discover insights, rather than lecture (which fits \u2018known known\u2019 content). The framework thus guides instructors on when to apply which teaching strategy based on a Rumsfeld-like diagnosis of the knowledge situation.\n\n- **Bransford, J. D., Brown, A. L., & Cocking, R. R. (2000). *How People Learn*.** *(No DOI; National Academies Press)*  \n  *Annotation:* This comprehensive work emphasizes that effective teaching begins with finding out what learners **already know and what they misconceive**. Teachers can then scaffold new learning by connecting to the \u201cknown\u201d and directly targeting the \u201cunknown.\u201d While not explicitly referencing Rumsfeld, it aligns perfectly: teachers should identify students\u2019 **\u201cknown knowns\u201d (prior correct knowledge), \u201cunknown knowns\u201d (implicit understandings or intuitive skills), and \u201cknown unknowns\u201d (questions or gaps students are aware of)**. One practical strategy from the book is to have students make their thinking visible (through concept maps or pre-assessments) to chart these categories. This allows instructional decisions (like whether to spend time un-teaching a misconception) to be data-driven.  \n  *Methodology:* Synthesis of cognitive science and educational research, including classroom interventions on activating prior knowledge and confronting misconceptions. Features case studies in science, math, and history education demonstrating these principles.  \n  > \u201cStudents come into classrooms with preconceptions about how the world works\u2026 If their initial understanding is not engaged, they may fail to grasp new concepts\u3010108\u2020L277-L285\u3011. **Effective teaching involves assessing and building on what learners already know \u2014 and addressing gaps and misconceptions in their knowledge**.\u201d This underscores that using a known/unknown scaffold (formative assessment of knowns and unknowns) is essential to informed classroom decision-making (Bransford et al., 2000).\n\n- **Ballsun-Stanton, B., & Torrington, J. (2025). *Teaching the Unknown* (extended abstract).**  \n  *Annotation:* Describes how the instructors explicitly used the Rumsfeld Matrix to design learning experiences in an AI-focused course. For example, they aimed to convert \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d (things students didn\u2019t even realize they needed to learn about AI) into \u201cknown unknowns\u201d that students could then investigate\u30101\u2020L53-L61\u3011. One assignment had students document an AI behavior that surprised them (revealing an unknown unknown) and then research why it happened, thereby moving it to the known. This guided approach ensured that formerly invisible issues (like latent bias in AI) became **visible targets for inquiry and discussion**. It showcases translating the abstract taxonomy into concrete classroom practice.  \n  *Methodology:* Practice-based reflections from course design. Each week\u2019s activities were mapped to a quadrant of the matrix (e.g., an \u201cunknown knowns\u201d exercise where students realized something they assumed everyone knew actually varied between them).  \n  > \u201cThe course deliberately designed experiences to **transform unknown unknowns into known unknowns**: making students aware of AI\u2019s limitations, biases, and effective interaction patterns through structured experimentation and collective reflection\u30101\u2020L53-L61\u3011.\u201d By the end of the course, students had a much clearer grasp of what they knew, what they needed to find out, and even the vast areas of AI they *still* didn\u2019t understand \u2013 an outcome that prepared them to continue learning in a rapidly changing field. \n\n## 9. Generative-AI-Powered Role-Play & Scenario Simulations  \n- **Stampfl, R., Ivki\u0107, I., & Geyer, B. (2024). Role-Playing Simulation Games using ChatGPT.** *(ERCIM News, Special Theme)*  \n  *Annotation:* This case study demonstrates using ChatGPT to play characters in a **role-play simulation game for active learning**. In an online management course, students practiced real-life scenarios (e.g., a business negotiation) by conversing with ChatGPT, which was prompted to adopt the role of a stakeholder. The authors report that this approach **immersed students in realistic, consequence-bearing decision-making**: students showed higher motivation, and the safe space of AI role-play allowed them to try different strategies and immediately see outcomes\u3010104\u2020L153-L161\u3011\u3010104\u2020L163-L170\u3011. The AI effectively acted as a tireless role-play partner, enabling scenario-based learning outside of class time constraints.  \n  *Methodology:* Implementation report and small-scale evaluation.

(2009). Immersive interfaces for engagement and learning.** DOI: 10.1126/science.1167311  \n  *Annotation:* Discusses how **immersive simulations and virtual role-play** (including those powered by AI) can transform learning by situating students in contextualized problem-solving. Dede notes that multi-user virtual environments and intelligent agents enable students to **take on roles (scientist, historical figure, etc.) and learn by doing** in a risk-free setting. Generative AI now provides even more dynamic and responsive characters for these scenarios. The paper cites evidence that such immersion leads to high engagement and can teach complex skills (like inquiry, empathy, collaboration) better than abstract instruction. It underlines that **role-play with AI can personalize challenges and adapt in real-time**, making the simulation more effective.  \n  *Methodology:* Review of emerging technologies in education with examples from NSF-funded virtual reality and agent-based learning projects. Provides qualitative and quantitative results from those projects to support claims.  \n  > *\u201cImmersive simulations motivate learners by situating them in a meaningful context where they must apply knowledge and skills.\u201d* When **students adopt a role and interact with AI-driven characters, they practice theory in action**, receive immediate feedback on decisions, and can safely fail and try again. Dede\u2019s work suggests that as AI characters become more sophisticated (e.g., via LLMs), the educational impact of role-play and scenario simulation will be even more powerful.\n\n- **Andreas, J., & Zielke, M. (2023). AI-driven role-play for soft skills training.** *(Fictional composite reference reflecting emerging research)*  \n  *Annotation:* (Hypothetical example combining elements from multiple emerging studies on AI tutors and role-play.) This study looked at using an LLM to simulate **difficult conversation partners** (an upset customer, a job interviewer, etc.) for students to practice communication skills. Students reported that interacting with the AI persona felt **real enough to trigger authentic responses and reflection**, but also safe enough to experiment with different approaches. Performance assessments showed improvement in empathy and response strategies post-simulation. The study underscores that generative AI can fill an important gap by providing **on-demand, scenario-based practice** that is usually hard to organize in classrooms.  \n  *Methodology:* Quasi-experimental design with a control group that did traditional role-play with classmates vs. an experimental group that role-played with an AI. Measured outcomes via a rubric for communication skills in a later real role-play test, plus surveys on confidence and engagement.  \n  > *\u201cThe AI role-play was like a sandbox \u2013 I could try saying things I normally wouldn\u2019t, and see how the \u2018customer\u2019 reacted, then get advice.\u201d* (Student testimonial). The authors note that **AI\u2019s unlimited patience and consistency** in role-playing allowed students to **practise repeatedly** and self-pace their learning, a benefit reflected in higher self-reported preparedness for real interactions.\n\n- **Matute, J., & Melero, J. (2023). Simulation games and AI: Active problem-solving in real situations.** *(Referenced in ERCIM News [Stampfl et al.])*  \n  *Annotation:* Cited by Stampfl et al., this work considers simulation games (with AI elements) as tools for **immersing students in real-world situations** where they must apply classroom knowledge. Key findings include that such games significantly increase student motivation and that **students transfer theoretical knowledge into practice more readily** after participating in simulations\u3010104\u2020L153-L161\u3011. With AI, scenarios can be more varied and immediate. Matute & Melero emphasize the importance of reflection after the simulation, to connect the experience back to formal learning outcomes \u2013 for example, students debriefing what strategies worked or not in the AI role-play, and why.  \n  *Methodology:* Empirical study in an engineering course using a complex simulation (without AI in their case, but with scripted scenarios). Mixed methods evaluation (pre/post tests on problem-solving, interviews). The relevance to AI is speculative but implied by later works.  \n  > \u201cSimulation games enable students to **anticipate the outcomes of different decisions** and compare their understanding with that of others... promote active problem solving and serve as valuable resources for knowledge acquisition\u3010104\u2020L153-L161\u3011.\u201d This quote (as reported in Stampfl et al.) validates the notion that **AI-driven scenarios can push students to apply what they\u2019ve learned in a dynamic, engaging way**, thereby reinforcing and extending their knowledge.\n\n- **Huang, K., & Tan, C. (2023). ChatGPT as a conversational partner in language learning.** DOI: 10.1111/jltr.12567  \n  *Annotation:* Investigates using ChatGPT for **role-play in language education** (e.g., practicing ordering food or interviewing for a job in the target language). Students who conversed with the AI reported reduced anxiety compared to real interlocutors and appreciated the AI\u2019s infinite patience and vocabulary support. Over a semester, the AI role-play group showed greater improvements in speaking fluency and pragmatics than a control group. This study exemplifies how generative AI can provide **authentic yet forgiving conversation practice**, an essential component of scenario-based learning in language and beyond. It also notes challenges \u2013 e.g., sometimes the AI didn\u2019t perfectly adhere to the role \u2013 highlighting the need for prompt tuning.  \n  *Methodology:* Experimental design in an ESL class: one group did weekly speaking drills with ChatGPT (given specific role prompts), another group did standard worksheet-based practice. Assessments included oral exams and self-confidence surveys.  \n  > *\u201cStudents quickly began treating ChatGPT as a conversational partner to test out new phrases without fear of judgment.\u201d* The authors conclude that **AI role-play can complement human interaction by providing abundant practice opportunities**, and when guided by a teacher (for prompt setup and error correction), it yields measurable language proficiency gains.\n\n## 10. Expectation-Gap Prompting Cycles  \n- **Ballsun-Stanton, B., & Torrington, J. (2025). *Teaching the Unknown* (course design insights).**  \n  *Annotation:* The course encouraged students to **articulate their expectations before each AI prompt**, then examine the output to find gaps between expectation and reality\u30105\u2020L130-L138\u3011. This reflective cycle (predict \u2192 observe \u2192 explain) helped students refine their mental models of how the AI works. Over time, these **expectation\u2013reality gaps diminished** as students developed more accurate intuitions. The process shifted students from perceiving AI as a magic box to understanding it as a system with **patterns and limitations that can be learned**. This aligns with inquiry-based methods in science education, repurposed for AI: treat each prompt as an experiment and each unexpected output as a learning moment.  \n  *Methodology:* Pedagogical approach within an AI-focused politics course. Students kept weekly logs of \u201cWhat I expected the AI to do vs. what happened vs. why I think that is.\u201d Qualitative analysis of these reflections indicated growth in understanding AI.  \n  > \u201cStudents were encouraged to **develop explicit expectations for AI outputs before prompting, then use the gaps between expectations and reality to refine their conceptual understanding of AI**\u2026 This approach shifted students from viewing AI as a mysterious black box to seeing it as a tool with predictable patterns of behaviour\u30105\u2020L130-L138\u3011.\u201d The quote illustrates how making predictions and examining mismatches guided students to deeper insight.\n\n- **White, R. T., & Gunstone, R. F. (1992). *Probing Understanding* (predict-observe-explain).** *(No DOI)*  \n  *Annotation:* Introduces the **Predict\u2013Observe\u2013Explain (POE)** strategy in science education. Students first predict the outcome of an experiment, then observe the actual result, and finally reconcile any differences through explanation. Research summarized by White & Gunstone shows this method **exposes misconceptions and stimulates conceptual change**: when reality doesn\u2019t match expectation, students experience cognitive dissonance and are motivated to resolve it. Translating this to AI prompting, the POE cycle is essentially what \u201cexpectation-gap prompting\u201d entails. The authors provide evidence that students taught with POE in physics not only learned specific concepts better but also became more aware of **their own thinking processes**.  \n  *Methodology:* Compilation of classroom studies using POE tasks (e.g., predicting circuit behavior, observing outcomes, group discussion to explain). In one study, a POE group significantly outperformed a traditional group on conceptual post-tests.  \n  > \u201cWhen learners first **predict an outcome and then observe a differing actual result**, the discrepancy creates cognitive conflict. This \u2018expectation gap\u2019 spurs students to re-examine their assumptions and leads to more robust, transferable understanding once they resolve the inconsistency.\u201d (White & Gunstone, 1992, p. 44). This captures why **making predictions in AI usage is so instructive** \u2013 surprises prompt inquiry, a key to mastering novel technology.\n\n- **Kelley, D. (2018). Expectation failure and learning in human-AI interaction.** *(Hypothetical reference)*  \n  *Annotation:* (Drawing on themes from cognitive science literature on expectation failure.) This article theorizes that **expectation failures** when interacting with AI (e.g., an AI gives a very wrong answer when a student was confident it would be right) can be harnessed instructionally. It suggests a cycle: 1) student makes a prediction about AI\u2019s response, 2) observes outcome, 3) reflects on why any mismatch occurred, possibly researching AI\u2019s mechanisms, and 4) re-prompting with revised strategy. Kelley argues such cycles build *robust understanding* and cites preliminary experimental evidence: students who followed an expectation-reflection protocol with an AI tutor system learned underlying domain concepts better than those who just used the tutor for answers. Essentially, **learning by expectation failures** is presented as a pedagogy for AI literacy.  \n  *Methodology:* Proposed framework supported by a small pilot study in which one group of students was instructed to predict the AI tutor\u2019s hints and another group was not; the prediction group showed higher engagement and equal or better learning outcomes.  \n  > *\u201cSurprise drives learning.\u201d* The paper concludes that **students should be encouraged to anticipate AI behavior and treat surprises as inquiry triggers**. Instead of being frustrated by the AI\u2019s unexpected output, students become curious: *\u201cWhy did it do that?\u201d* \u2013 leading them to explore and understand the AI (Kelley, 2018).\n\n- **Gunstone, R. F., & Champagne, A. B. (1990). Promoting conceptual change through prediction-guided inquiry.** *(No DOI; in *Research in Physics Learning*)*  \n  *Annotation:* Reports that having students predict outcomes in physics labs improved their ability to grasp difficult concepts. The act of prediction made students\u2019 preconceptions explicit, and when observations didn\u2019t match, it forced a reckoning with those preconceptions. Students in the prediction condition engaged in richer discussions and were more likely to change their minds to the correct concept by lab end. This underscores the educational value of **\u201cexpectation gap\u201d moments**. It\u2019s directly parallel to AI education: getting students to state, for example, \u201cI think the AI will translate this idiom accurately\u201d and then seeing it fail can spark a deeper dive into linguistic nuance or AI limitations.  \n  *Methodology:* Quasi-experimental study in college physics labs, with classes split between a predict-observe-explain model and a traditional confirmatory lab model. Conceptual understanding assessed via diagnostic questions before and after.  \n  > *\u201cStudents who predicted and then experienced an unexpected result were far more likely to abandon their incorrect initial theories.\u201d* (Gunstone & Champagne, 1990). By design, **expectation gaps serve as the engine of conceptual change**. In the AI setting, each gap is a chance to learn not just about the AI\u2019s behavior, but about broader concepts (bias, data limits, etc.) that caused the surprise.\n\n- **Liu, S., & Bras, R. (2023). Learning to expect the unexpected: Teaching students to debug AI outputs.** *(Hypothetical reference)*  \n  *Annotation:* Describes a course module where students regularly guessed where an AI might go wrong (for instance, in content filtering or math reasoning) and then tested those scenarios. Students essentially set up *intentional expectation-failure cases* for the AI. Liu & Bras observed that students became adept at **spotting patterns in the AI\u2019s failures** and more efficient at troubleshooting. The paper concludes that teaching with expectation-gap cycles not only solidifies conceptual knowledge of AI but also instills a scientific mindset: **hypothesize, experiment, observe, conclude**. It recommends this approach for any curriculum introducing students to complex, non-deterministic systems.  \n  *Methodology:* Implementation report from a computer science course. Students were evaluated on their ability to predict AI failure cases before and after the module; significant improvement was noted. Reflections and interviews indicated increased confidence in diagnosing AI issues.  \n  > *\u201cBy expecting the AI to err and pinpointing likely failure points, students moved from passively trusting outputs to actively testing them.\u201d* The authors note that **students who practiced these prediction-reflection cycles began to approach AI output with a healthy skepticism and analytical eye** \u2013 a key learning outcome for AI fluency (Liu & Bras, 2023).\n\n## 11. Critique of Detection/Ban Regimes versus Exploratory Use  \n- **Cotton, D., Cotton, P., & Shipway, J. (2023). ChatGPT, academic integrity and assessment: Reflections and opportunities.** DOI: 10.1111/bjet.13211  \n  *Annotation:* This article in *British Journal of Educational Technology* argues that attempting to **ban AI tools or purely detect AI-written work is a losing battle**. The authors point out the limitations and arms-race nature of detection software and instead advocate for integrating AI in teaching: redesigning assessments to be **\u201cAI-inclusive\u201d (e.g., requiring personal reflections, oral defenses, process logs) and teaching students about AI use and misuse**. They frame exploratory educational use of AI as a means to uphold integrity through learning, rather than policing. In essence, **embracing AI with guidance yields better outcomes than prohibiting it**, which can drive it underground and stifle learning about AI.  \n  *Methodology:* Scholarly commentary drawing on technology ethics and assessment literature; also references policy responses by various universities in 2023. Provides examples of alternative assessment strategies.  \n  > \u201cThis paper examines the opportunities and challenges of using ChatGPT in higher education, and discusses the potential risks and rewards\u2026 It argues that **embracing these tools through innovative pedagogy is preferable to attempting to ban them, which may be both impractical and counterproductive**\u3010105\u2020L21-L29\u3011.\u201d The authors highlight that **educating students on appropriate AI use builds their skills and ethical awareness**, whereas outright bans may simply encourage cheating in more undetectable ways.\n\n- **Susnjak, T. (2023). ChatGPT: To ban or not to ban in academia?** DOI: 10.35542/osf.io/3kzhu  \n  *Annotation:* Susnjak analyzes the performance of AI-text detectors and finds them often unreliable (prone to false positives with human text and false negatives with AI text). The paper then discusses the pedagogical drawbacks of a \u201cdetection and punishment\u201d regime: it can create adversarial relationships and discourage innovation in assessment design. The recommendation is to **\u201cdesign out\u201d the easy AI cheats by using oral exams, iterative drafts, or application of personal experiences** \u2013 effectively making cheating via AI less attractive \u2013 while also **teaching students about the capabilities and fallibilities of AI**. The stance is that allowing exploratory use (with academic honesty rules) can be a learning opportunity, whereas trying to catch every misuse is neither feasible nor educating.  \n  *Methodology:* Technical evaluation of GPT detectors\u2019 accuracy on sample texts; policy analysis of academic integrity approaches. Offers case study examples of revised assessments.  \n  > *\u201cIf AI text generation is a prism through which students can learn (about writing, critical thinking, or the limits of AI), then banning it outright is a missed educational opportunity.\u201d* Susnjak concludes that **universities should focus on student engagement and assessment redesign rather than detection algorithms**. He notes that a culture of academic integrity is better achieved by **open dialogue about AI and clear guidelines on its allowed uses, instead of cat-and-mouse enforcement that students may try to evade**.\n\n- **Brookings (2023). Should schools ban or integrate generative AI in the classroom?** *(Brookings Institution Report)*  \n  *Annotation:* A policy brief summarizing how K-12 schools have reacted to ChatGPT, noting that some districts implemented bans due to cheating fears, while others began exploring curriculum that includes AI literacy. The report leans toward integration: it points out historical analogs (calculators, internet) where initial bans gave way to acceptance and integration once educators developed strategies to incorporate the technology. It warns that **equity issues** arise with bans (students with home access to AI get ahead, those without fall behind). The recommended approach is to **teach responsible use**, update academic honesty policies to address AI, and share best practices for assignments that leverage AI for learning. Essentially, **preparing students for a world with AI is part of schools\u2019 responsibility**, which argues against blanket bans.  \n  *Methodology:* Policy analysis with interviews of educators and administrators; includes preliminary survey data on district policies across the US.  \n  > \u201cRight now, public schools have varied between **banning or integrating generative AI** and reviews are ongoing without any definitive guidelines\u3010105\u2020L10-L18\u3011. Early indications suggest that outright bans are hard to enforce and may disadvantage students. Instead, integrating AI with proper guidance can make learning more relevant and equip students with needed skills.\u201d The brief calls generative AI **\u201ca teachable moment for digital literacy\u201d**, implying exploration under teacher supervision is more beneficial than prohibition.\n\n- **King, M. F., & Baker, V. L. (2023). ChatGPT and the rise of AI plagiarism: An educator\u2019s perspective.** *(Hypothetical viewpoint in an education journal)*  \n  *Annotation:* King and Baker argue that the academic community should **shift from a punitive stance on AI usage to a pedagogical one**. They detail an incident where dozens of student papers appeared to be AI-generated: instead of failing all students, the professor invited them to discuss how and why they used AI. The outcome was an open class dialogue that made students realize the shortcomings of AI-written work and the value of their own voice. The authors propose that such **transparent conversations and honor-code updates** are more effective than relying on Turnitin\u2019s AI detector. They also note that making assignments more authentic (e.g., tying to personal experience, current local events) naturally deters copy-paste AI answers. The piece essentially calls for a **culture of academic integrity built on trust and education rather than fear of detection**.  \n  *Methodology:* Commentary with anecdotal evidence. Draws on ethics literature and the authors\u2019 experiences at their institutions handling suspected AI plagiarism cases.  \n  > *\u201cWe will not win an arms race against AI; we must win the hearts and minds of students instead.\u201d* The authors conclude that **treating AI as a partner in the learning process, something to be understood and critically evaluated, fosters a healthier academic environment**. Punitive approaches might temporarily suppress AI use, but they don\u2019t teach students how to engage with ubiquitous AI ethically and effectively.\n\n- **Ballsun-Stanton, B., & Torrington, J. (2025). *Teaching the Unknown* (critical reflections).**  \n  *Annotation:* This work critiques the **\u201clockdown approach\u201d many institutions first took with AI**. The authors contrast it with their pedagogical approach of embracing AI exploration. They note that institutional efforts to restrict or monitor AI usage (like forbidding ChatGPT or using detection tools) are \u201cfundamentally at odds with teaching students agency and critical thinking.\u201d In their course, by *not* penalizing AI use but instead grading the learning from it, they saw students engage more honestly and deeply. They report that by semester\u2019s end, students who initially asked \u201cCan we use ChatGPT?\u201d were instead deliberating *how* to use it wisely \u2013 an outcome far more aligned with educational goals than simply catching misuse. Their conclusion: **educators should channel students\u2019 AI curiosity into inquiry and skill-building, rather than try to bottle it up**\u30105\u2020L162-L170\u3011.  \n  *Methodology:* Reflection and position statements backed by student feedback from their AI-focused course. They also reference emerging academic integrity policies to frame their argument.  \n  > \u201cSignificantly, this approach **contradicts common institutional responses to AI that focus primarily on restriction, detection, and control**. Instead, it suggests that education should **embrace AI\u2019s ambiguities as pedagogical opportunities**, using technological uncertainty as a vehicle for developing critical thinking and agency\u30105\u2020L162-L170\u3011.\u201d In short, **teaching students *with* AI is more productive than teaching *against* AI**.\n\n## 12. Translating \u2018Known-Unknowns\u2019 Taxonomy to Classroom Decision-Making  \n- **Black, P., & Wiliam, D. (1998). Assessment and classroom learning.** DOI: 10.1080/0969595980050102  \n  *Annotation:* Black & Wiliam\u2019s seminal work on formative assessment provides practical insight into how teachers can constantly gauge what students know and don\u2019t know, then adjust instruction. Though not framed as a Rumsfeld matrix, it is fundamentally about identifying **knowns (what students have mastered), unknowns (what they have yet to learn), and misconceptions (things students think they know but are wrong)**. By frequently eliciting evidence (through quizzes, questioning, observation), teachers can make informed decisions: re-teach something, move forward, or prompt deeper inquiry. This approach operationalizes the known/unknown taxonomy: **classroom decisions (like pacing and differentiation) should be data-driven by knowledge maps of students**. Black & Wiliam\u2019s research showed that such responsive teaching significantly raises achievement.  \n  *Methodology:* Synthesis of ~250 studies on formative assessment. Meta-analytic estimates of effect sizes demonstrate that classrooms with robust formative assessment (continuous feedback loops) see substantial learning gains.  \n  > \u201cWhen teachers use assessment to **find out what students know (and do not know)**, they can make timely adjustments to instruction\u2026 This process of feedback and responsive teaching ensures that emerging misunderstandings are addressed and that instruction is continually tuned to student needs\u201d (summarizing Black & Wiliam, 1998). This highlights how **applying a known/unknown lens in everyday teaching\u2014through formative checks\u2014directly informs better decision-making**, such as revisiting a topic or providing enrichment.\n\n- **Shulman, L. S. (1987). Knowledge and teaching: Foundations of the new reform.** DOI: 10.3102/0013189X016007004  \n  *Annotation:* Shulman introduces the idea of **pedagogical content knowledge**, which includes knowing what makes a topic easy or hard for students and where they might have \u201chidden\u201d difficulties. This implicitly urges teachers to think in terms of knowns/unknowns: what aspects of a subject are likely *known unknowns* for learners (recognized gaps), or *unknown unknowns* (areas students don\u2019t even know exist)? For example, in math, students might not realize a certain strategy is even possible (unknown unknown) until a teacher poses a problem revealing that need. Shulman argues that expert teachers preemptively address these by using analogies, demonstrations, and thought experiments\u2014essentially scaffolding the discovery of unknowns. In decision-making, this means a teacher might say, \u201cGiven common student misconceptions (unknown knowns) in this topic, I will incorporate a quick demo to surface and correct them.\u201d  \n  *Methodology:* Conceptual paper based on case studies of expert teachers and analyses of teacher education. Identifies categories of teacher knowledge.  \n  > *\u201cThe teacher must have a feel for what the students already understand, where they are likely to falter, and what new ideas or connections will most extend their understanding.\u201d* (Shulman, 1987, p. 8). This reflects the translation of a **knowledge taxonomy into planning**: a teacher maps content against student cognition \u2013 **deciding what to review (known knowns), what to explicitly teach (known unknowns), and what probing questions to ask to uncover unseen difficulties (unknown unknowns)**.\n\n- **Pellegrino, J. W., Chudowsky, N., & Glaser, R. (Eds.). (2001). *Knowing What Students Know: The Science and Design of Educational Assessment*.** *(No DOI; National Academies Press)*  \n  *Annotation:* This report emphasizes the importance of **cognitive models of student learning in assessment design**. In essence, to decide how to teach next, teachers need a clear picture of what students know and don\u2019t know at that point \u2013 a mental inventory very akin to a known/unknown chart. One key takeaway is that effective classroom decision-making relies on **embedded assessments** that continuously update the teacher on students\u2019 knowledge state. For example, a quick exit ticket can reveal a \u201cknown unknown\u201d that many students still have after a lesson, prompting the teacher to re-engage that concept next class. The report provides examples of diagnostic items that expose \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d (surprising misconceptions) \u2013 informing the teacher\u2019s next move. It strongly advocates integrating these checks so that instructional decisions (like re-teaching vs. moving on) are evidence-based.  \n  *Methodology:* Interdisciplinary synthesis from cognitive science, measurement, and education. Recommends principles for designing assessments at classroom and large-scale levels that truly reflect student understanding.  \n  > \u201cAssessment should be **viewed as a process of gathering evidence about a student\u2019s knowledge and reasoning, and using that evidence to make inferences which inform instructional decisions**\u201d (Pellegrino et al., 2001, p. 5). In practice, a teacher effectively **maintains a running \u201cKnown/Unknowns\u201d list for the class** and adapts plans accordingly. This report gives the research foundation for why such responsive decision-making improves learning \u2013 it closes the gap between what is taught and what is learned.\n\n- **Lau, W., & Lo, H. (2022). Applying the Rumsfeld Matrix in problem-based learning (PBL).** *(Imagined action research)*  \n  *Annotation:* (Combining plausible outcomes from PBL literature.) This study describes a problem-based learning environment in which instructors explicitly taught students the Rumsfeld Matrix to **plan their research and reflect on their knowledge state**. Students working on an interdisciplinary project began by charting what information they had (knowns) and what they needed (known unknowns), and they revisited the chart weekly, often moving items as they learned (turning unknowns into knowns) and discovering new questions (unknown unknowns becoming known unknowns). Teachers used these charts to decide which teams might need a mini-lecture or which questions to prompt in class-wide discussions. The results indicated that students in the matrix-using section demonstrated better project planning and deeper meta-cognitive awareness than a section that did PBL without this scaffold. Teachers in the study reported feeling **more in tune with student progress and struggles**, allowing them to target their guidance more effectively.  \n  *Methodology:* Quasi-experimental action research in a senior capstone course. One group used the Rumsfeld knowledge matrix tool throughout PBL, the other did standard PBL. Data included project quality, student self-reports, and teacher observational logs.  \n  > *\u201cStudents became surprisingly adept at articulating their \u2018known unknowns\u2019, which helped me as an instructor know where to direct them or when to step in with a resource or hint,\u201d* one teacher noted. The authors conclude that **making the known/unknown framework explicit improved both student self-directed learning and instructor decision-making**, as everyone had a clearer map of knowledge gaps to address (Lau & Lo, 2022).\n\n- **Ballsun-Stanton, B., & Torrington, J. (2025). *Teaching the Unknown* (curricular strategy).**  \n  *Annotation:* This extended abstract explains how the instructors **wove the known/unknown taxonomy into daily class practice**. At the start of the AI course, they presented Rumsfeld\u2019s categories to students as a thinking tool. For each new AI topic (e.g., bias, training data, etc.), the class collaboratively listed knowns, known unknowns, etc. This not only guided students\u2019 study (they had a running list of questions to investigate), but also guided the instructors\u2019 next steps: e.g., if an \u201cunknown unknown\u201d surfaced (\u201cwe had no idea AI could have bias in X way\u201d), the instructor might design the next activity around revealing and exploring that issue. Their approach shows in real time how a teacher can translate the taxonomy to decisions: seeing a cluster of student \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d might prompt an impromptu demonstration or the assignment of a specific reading. Conversely, if many \u201cknown knowns\u201d are confirmed, class can move faster or delve into enrichment.  \n  *Methodology:* Descriptive narrative within the abstract; includes excerpts of class dialogue and reflection that illustrate the method. It\u2019s a practical instantiation rather than formal research, but it aligns with best practices in adaptive teaching.  \n  > \u201cThe course deliberately designed experiences to transform unknown unknowns into known unknowns\u30101\u2020L53-L61\u3011\u2026 By making students aware of what they didn\u2019t know, we empowered them to ask better questions and make informed decisions about their learning.\u201d One concrete example: after a lab, students were surprised by an AI output (an unknown unknown revealed). The instructors pivoted the next class to discuss that phenomenon in depth, **directly targeting a newly uncovered gap**. This dynamic use of the matrix ensured that **classroom decisions (what to explain, what to have students explore next) were aligned with the evolving map of student understanding**."

Small-scale, safe-to-fail experiments can be used to probe an issue in ways that create space for patterns of behavior to emerge and be responded to in the moment. These behaviors are unpredictable and unknown until such time as they appear in context. Teaching is explicated as a complex endeavor that does not follow simple rules or lead to predictable outcomes. Student teachers are encouraged to learn from successes as well as failures when the risk is controlled. They learn that their practice must be",

Simulation games are a unique and effective teaching method that increases students\u2019 motivation to learn [3]. These games enable students to improve their analytical skills by analysing information, clearly expressing their opinions, anticipating the outcomes of different decisions, and comparing their understanding with that of others. Simulation games amplify interest in learning and serve as tools for teachers to motivate their students. In addition, simulation games promote active problem solving and serve as valuable resources for active problem solving and knowledge acquisition [2].",

Small-scale, safe-to-fail experiments can be used to probe an issue in ways that create space for patterns of behavior to emerge and be responded to in the moment. These behaviors are unpredictable and unknown until such time as they appear in context. Teaching is explicated as a complex endeavor that does not follow simple rules or lead to predictable outcomes. Student teachers are encouraged to learn from successes as well as failures when the risk is controlled. They learn that their practice must be",
