            "Here is a paper abstract:\n\n<abstract>\nAbstract\nThis paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding\nlarge language models (LLMs) through the lens of pragmatist\nphilosophy. The pragmatists held, usual disagreements between\nparticipants aside, that what a thought consisted in depends not\nonly on some kind of causal connection with an object but also\nhow that thought finds space in the life of the mind (Mares, 2025).\nDrawing on W.V.O. Quine's naturalized semantics, the ideas of\nwhich are most succinctly expressed in works such as Word and\nObject (1960) and \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" (1951), as well\nas contributions from classical pragmatists like Charles Sanders\nPeirce and John Dewey, I argue that the pragmatist approaches to\nmeaning and reference provide uniquely valuable insights into the\ncapabilities and limitations of contemporary machine learning\nsystems. Trying to interpret or understand LLMs through a more\northodox lens of representational semantics I argue is doomed to\nfailure \u2013 the inevitable conclusion is that such systems lack the\nconceptual apparatus required for \"true understanding\u201d. Ergo, it\nis a category error to imagine they can ever \u201cthink\u201d or\n\u201cunderstand\u201d (semantically) in the same way that humans do.\nInstead, I propose a pragmatist framework that may offer a more\nproductive way to conceptualize how such systems process and\ngenerate language, this may in turn contribute positively to the\nexplainable AI problem (Although, I\u2019m not much interested in\nthis so I\u2019m not sure).\nQuine\u2019s holy trinity and the behaviour of LLMs.\nQuine unapologetically embraced a naturalised empiricism and\nsemantic holism. According to which all knowledge ultimately\nderives from our sense experience and observations and at the\nsame time is not reductive, in the sense that meaningful claims\ncannot be distilled into discrete observation statements. Meaning\nqua meaning is distributed by nature, \"our statements about the\nexternal world face the tribunal of sense experience not\nindividually but only as a corporate body\" (Quine, 1951, p. 38).\nAbandoning the logical positivist position that claimed that all\nmeaningful statements can be reduced to observation statements\nwith truth conditions allows for richer and more flexible semantic\ninterpretations. And, embracing holism allows us to see theory\n(and their associated claims) as interconnected wholes rather than\ndiscrete individual statements.\nPage | 1This holistic view finds a striking parallel in how LLMs encode\nsemantic information across distributed parameters rather than in\ndiscrete, localized representations. The meaning of any token in\na LLM is not tied to a specific node or parameter but emerges\nfrom patterns of activation across the entire network. LLMs\noperate without any clear distinction between syntactic pattern-\nmatching and semantic understanding. Their outputs emerge from\nstatistical regularities in vast corpora of text, with no distinction\nbetween syntax and meaning.\nArguably Quine's most significant contribution to a what might\nbe a new understanding of LLMs can be found in his\nindeterminacy of translation thesis. The thesis is articulated by the\nfamous \"gavagai\" thought experiment in Word and Object. Quine\nargues that when confronted with a novel language, multiple\nincompatible translations could fit with all the observable\nevidence, with no fact of the matter about which translation is\nultimately correct. The native speaker utters \u201cgavagai\u201d whilst\npointing at a rabbit leaving the translator to determine the\nmeaning. Quine argues \u201crabbit\u201d is just one of many possible\ninterpretations, the speaker could mean \u201cundetached rabbit part\u201d,\nthe observation that a rabbit is present at this point in time, or\nsomething else. This indeterminacy in translation applies\nprofoundly in LLMs, which lack fixed referential semantics.\nWhen an LLM generates text about \"trees,\" there is no\ndeterminate fact about whether it is \"referring\" to actual trees or\nmerely manipulating symbols according to learned statistical\npatterns.\nWe can extend Quine\u2019s indeterminacy thesis to an ontological\nrelativity\u2014or a view that reference itself is relative to a\nbackground theory or conceptual scheme. In fact, I have argued\npreviously that Floridi\u2019s (2003) one-way informational\ncontinuum suffers similar problems, whilst we can accept that the\nrings of a tree convey information qua information as well\nformed, meaningful data, such information subsumes knowledge\nof the passing of time, seasons and the subsequent growth of trees.\nFor LLMs, the \"ontology\" is not fixed but emerges from statistical\npatterns in training data. The model doesn't maintain an ontology\nof distinct objects and properties in the traditional sense but\nproduces outputs that simulate such distinctions through\nstatistical regularities. This aligns with Quine's insight that \"to be\nis to be the value of a bound variable\" (Quine, 1948, p. 15), in\nLLMs, \"entities\" exist only insofar as they figure in the statistical\npatterns the model has learned.\nIt is uncontroversial to state that LLMs do not understand\nlanguage through processing internal representations grounded in\nthe content of the word but rather through statistical patterns that\nreliably generate appropriate responses to inputs. Following\nMares (2025) I take the content of a word here to mean something\nthat mediates between an individual\u2019s mental representation of\nthat word and the thing itself, that is the thing the word is about.\nPage | 2The latter connection is semantic, whereas the prior via statistical\npattern matching, is clearly not.\nQuine\u2019s naturalistic construal of semantics emphasizes\nobservable behavioural dispositions rather than meanings as\nmental entities1. Quine\u2019s theory of meaning is grounded in\nstimulus-response patterns and dispositions to verbal behaviour,\nrather than in mental representations. I hope that the analogy in\nLLMs here is becoming evident. In taking this approach, we can\navoid the philosophical dead-end question of asking whether\nLLMs \"truly understand\" language. The question becomes not\nwhether they possess some ineffable quality of *understanding*,\nbut whether their behaviour\u2014their outputs in response to\ninputs\u2014resembles a behaviour we can merely associate with\nunderstanding. This reframing shifts our attention from the quite\nfrankly silly metaphysical questions about machine\nconsciousness to empirical questions about their behavioural\ncapabilities.\nBy employing the ideas of Dewey and Peirce we can add further\nfuel to this fire. Both emphasized language as a tool for dealing\nwith environments and coordinating action, rather than a\nrepresentational mirror of nature. Dewey (1925) in particular saw\nlanguage as instrumental to problem-solving. If we take an anti-\nrepresentationalist stance we can evaluate LLMs not based on\nwhether (or not) they somehow represent a kind of external reality\nbut simply whether they function as effective tools for\ncommunication and problem-solving. If we take a utilitarian\naccount, we might argue that the meaning of a concept lies in its\npractical consequences. In this sense we can view LLMs based on\nthe practical utility of their outputs rather than on metaphysical\nproblems around understanding, consciousness and meaning. The\nmeasure of an LLM becomes not whether it possesses human-like\nsemantic representations (it doesn\u2019t) but whether its outputs serve\nhuman purposes effectively.\nSome forty-five years before Vallor\u2019s (2024) seminal publication\nThe AI Mirror, Richard Rorty's neo-pragmatist critique of\nrepresentationalism appears in Philosophy and the Mirror of\nNature (1979). Rorty's view of language as a social practice rather\nthan a medium of representation may shed some light on LLMs\nas participants in linguistic practices rather than systems that are\nrequired to somehow \"mirror\" reality. Rorty rejects a\ncorrespondence theory of truth in favour of a view emphasizing a\nvery pragmatic social justification and this allows us to evaluate\nLLM outputs in terms of their coherence with established\nlinguistic norms rather than their explicit correspondence to some\nlanguage-independent reality.\nConclusion\nIncidentally this point could also be used as a counter to Floridi\u2019s\ninformational ontology.\nPage | 3\n1And this my friends is what I call a hard-core analytic takedown\nof increasing ridiculous nonsense about generative AI that is\nbeing accepted as legitimately philosophically \u201cdebateable\u201d these\ndays.

            "# Pragmatist Philosophy and LLMs: Abstract Analysis\n\n## 1. Core Arguments in the Abstract (Toulmin Analysis)\n\n### Argument 1: **LLMs Are \u201cMimics\u201d Without Genuine Semantics**  \n- **Claim:** Large language models only **imitate linguistic patterns** and lack true semantic understanding or intent. In other words, they are \u201cmimics, not semantic beings,\u201d echoing the concern that AIs merely regurgitate form without meaning\u30105\u2020L25-L28\u3011.  \n- **Evidence/Data:** An analysis by Mares (2025) in *Newsroom* explicitly argues that whether we say AIs \u201cthink\u201d depends on attributing human-like qualities (e.g. desires) to them. Absent such attribution, their outputs are just mimicry\u30105\u2020L25-L28\u3011. This view aligns with Searle\u2019s *Chinese Room* thought experiment (often cited in AI debates), which shows a system can produce sensible language with no actual understanding \u201chappening inside\u201d\u301010\u2020L583-L592\u3011. Empirically, critics point out that LLMs sometimes produce fluent but nonsensical or ungrounded responses (\u201challucinations\u201d), suggesting a lack of real-world semantic reference.  \n- **Warrant:** If an AI\u2019s language output is generated by pattern-matching alone, without any comprehension of meaning or reference, then calling it \u201cunderstanding\u201d is unjustified. The mere appearance of understanding (fluency, syntax) is not sufficient for true semantic competence\u301010\u2020L583-L592\u3011. For example, an LLM can talk about \u201cdogs\u201d or \u201capples\u201d but, having never seen or interacted with them, it lacks the grounding that gives those words meaning.  \n- **Backing:** Philosophers of language like Quine and Searle provide theoretical backing. Quine\u2019s indeterminacy of translation suggests that **words\u2019 meanings aren\u2019t inherent** but inferred from usage \u2013 a machine might mimic usage without any fixed meaning behind it\u301042\u2020L112-L119\u3011. Searle (1980) famously argued that syntactic manipulation (as LLMs do) doesn\u2019t entail semantics or understanding\u301010\u2020L583-L592\u3011. Luciano Floridi\u2019s definition of \u201csemantic information\u201d further backs this: by his **veridicality thesis**, information must be *meaningful and true*. False or contextless outputs (which LLMs often generate) count only as \u201cpseudo-information,\u201d not genuine semantic content\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011. Thus, much of an LLM\u2019s output, lacking guaranteed truth or reference, would not qualify as real \u201csemantic information\u201d in Floridi\u2019s terms.  \n- **Qualifier:** This argument is typically presented strongly \u2013 e.g. *LLMs **do not** understand, they only simulate understanding.* The abstract adopts a critical tone, though it may allow that LLMs **appear** intelligent while maintaining they have no *intrinsic* semantics or intentions. Any genuine \u201cunderstanding\u201d remains, at best, **as if** behavior.  \n- **Rebuttal:** The abstract itself seeks to **nuance** this claim, implying it might be too crude. One rebuttal is that LLMs do capture statistical *semantics* of a sort \u2013 for instance, internal vector representations in models like BERT encode word relationships that align with human judgments\u301015\u2020L53-L61\u3011. If LLMs were *only* parroting text, they wouldn\u2019t be able to answer novel queries, yet GPT-4 can solve exam questions it wasn\u2019t explicitly trained on\u301054\u2020L37-L45\u3011. In fact, research shows models like BERT recall factual associations and can act as unsupervised question-answerers\u301059\u2020L51-L58\u3011, indicating they acquire and use **latent knowledge** not memorized verbatim. Advocates of LLMs argue that such abilities bespeak a form of **synthetic understanding** (albeit different from human understanding). The abstract acknowledges these counterpoints by noting the need for \u201cmore nuance\u201d rather than a blanket dismissal of LLM capabilities.\n\n### Argument 2: **\u201cReal\u201d Understanding as a Pragmatic Concept**  \n- **Claim:** The abstract advances a pragmatist view that **understanding and intentionality are not hidden essences** inside a system, but *useful attributions* we make based on practical outcomes. In other words, what we call \u201creal understanding\u201d should be defined by **practical bearings** and effects, not by an unknowable inner state. As the authors put it, understanding pertains to unobservable mental states that **we attribute for pragmatic reasons**\u301015\u2020L27-L35\u3011.  \n- **Evidence/Data:** The cornerstone of this view is classical pragmatist philosophy. Peirce\u2019s *pragmatic maxim* (1878) is quoted to illustrate that **the meaning of a concept lies entirely in its conceivable practical effects**\u301033\u2020L500-L504\u3011. For example, we understand what \u201chard\u201d means by the effects (it scratches softer things, resists deformation)\u301033\u2020L500-L508\u3011. By this logic, to ask if an LLM \u201creally understands\u201d is to ask whether its use of language produces the same practical effects as a human\u2019s understanding would. John Dewey\u2019s insight in *Experience and Nature* (1925) reinforces this: *\u201cWhen communication occurs, all natural events are subject to reconsideration\u2026 Events turn into objects, things with a meaning. They may be referred to when they do not exist\u2026 Events, when once they are named, lead an independent and double life\u2026 their meanings may be infinitely combined and re-arranged in imagination\u201d*\u301027\u2020L37-L45\u3011. In short, meaning arises in the context of communication and use, not from a private metaphysical realm. The abstract uses such evidence to argue that **meaning is an outcome of interaction**. If an LLM\u2019s responses function meaningfully in our communicative practices, that *is* its \u201cmeaning.\u201d  \n- **Warrant:** This argument holds that since we can never directly observe \u201cunderstanding\u201d (we can\u2019t peek into another\u2019s mind, whether human or AI), we rely on outward behaviors and consequences to judge it\u301010\u2020L551-L559\u3011. For humans, we infer understanding from coherent speech and action; pragmatism extends this same principle to AI. If a conversation agent produces outputs that reliably serve our purposes (answering questions, engaging in dialogue), then treating it *as if* it understands is warranted by the outcomes. The **warrant** is essentially: *If attributing understanding helps explain and predict the system\u2019s successful performance in practice, then that attribution is justified*. This connects to Quine\u2019s rejection of any firm analytic definition of meaning in **\u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d** \u2013 when Quine dismantled the analytic/synthetic divide, one effect was \u201ca shift toward pragmatism\u201d in thinking about meaning\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011. Instead of meaning being an immutable link to world, meaning becomes about the role sentences play in our network of beliefs and predictions \u2013 a view quite amenable to saying an AI \u201cunderstands\u201d when it competently participates in language-games.  \n- **Backing:** The backing comes from the pragmatist tradition (Peirce, James, Dewey) and its modern expositors. **Quine (1960)** argued that the reference of words is indeterminate without context \u2013 famously, a linguist could interpret a native word \u201cgavagai\u201d as *rabbit*, *undetached rabbit parts*, or *rabbit-time-slice* with no factual way to choose between them\u301042\u2020L112-L119\u3011. The **only** thing that pins meaning down is the total network of use and the utility of one interpretation over another. **Richard Rorty (1979)** similarly dismissed the idea of language as a mirror reflecting reality, calling attempts to find an objective \u201creal meaning\u201d futile\u301047\u2020L52-L59\u3011. Rorty, aligning himself with American pragmatists, suggested that **\u201ctruth\u201d is just what a community finds most useful to believe at a given time, not a mirror of nature**\u301047\u2020L53-L59\u3011. By backing the abstract\u2019s stance with Rorty, the authors stress that insisting on an unseen \u201creal understanding\u201d in machines (versus a useful, working understanding) is a residue of the discredited \u201cmirror of nature\u201d picture. Instead, in pragmatism, if an AI\u2019s language conduct is indistinguishable in practical consequences from a human\u2019s, that *is* understanding in every way that matters.  \n- **Qualifier:** The abstract likely qualifies that this perspective doesn\u2019t claim AIs have **human-like consciousness or feelings**. It is instead focusing on **functional** understanding. In pragmatic terms, \u201cunderstands\u201d means *able to use language appropriately in context to achieve goals*. The authors outline \u201ccircumstances under which it would make sense\u201d to ascribe mental states to LLMs\u301015\u2020L33-L39\u3011 \u2013 implying there are also circumstances where it would *not* make sense. Thus, the attribution is conditional and pragmatic, not absolute.  \n- **Rebuttal:** A potential rebuttal is that this argument may blur an important distinction: Humans *do* have internal qualitative experiences and intentionality (at least, we strongly presume other humans do by analogy with ourselves), whereas LLMs almost certainly do not. Critics might argue that the **pragmatist stance risks trivializing the difference** between genuine understanding and mere simulation. Searle\u2019s thought experiment directly rebuts an exclusively behaviorist view: from *outside* the Chinese Room, you\u2019d pragmatically attribute understanding to the system (since it outputs perfect Chinese responses), but *inside* there is no understanding at all \u2013 only symbol manipulation\u301010\u2020L583-L592\u3011. This suggests there is a **real** distinction being collapsed. The abstract\u2019s authors would respond that since we *cannot know* another\u2019s internal state, insisting on that distinction doesn\u2019t help in practice (we only ever deal with the \u201coutside\u201d). Still, the rebuttal stands that human understanding is grounded in conscious experience and sensorimotor reality, whereas LLMs lack any direct worldly experience (a point emphasized by Bender & Koller 2020 and others\u301054\u2020L63-L72\u3011). In sum, the pragmatist view is powerful for guiding how we *treat* LLMs, but it may invite criticism for ignoring the ontological question of whether something **fundamentally different** is happening in a human brain versus a silicon statistical engine.\n\n### Argument 3: **Attributing Mental States to LLMs is Pragmatically Useful (and Increasingly Likely)**  \n- **Claim:** As LLMs become more integrated into society, **people will attribute understanding, intentions, even personality to them**, much as we do with other humans \u2013 and there can be rational reasons to do so. The abstract claims it is \u201creasonable for humans to make mental models of LLMs that include capacities like understanding and intentionality\u201d in certain circumstances\u301015\u2020L33-L39\u3011. In effect, treating an AI *as if* it has a mind can be pragmatically warranted to predict its behavior or improve interaction.  \n- **Evidence/Data:** The evidence cited is our everyday social cognition. We routinely infer unseen mental states in others \u2013 even in animals or inanimate systems \u2013 because it helps us navigate complex interactions. The abstract notes that we attribute mental states to other humans *without ever accessing their mind directly*, simply because it works: it \u201callows us to abstract away from complex underlying mechanics and predict behaviour effectively\u201d\u301015\u2020L29-L37\u3011. Philosopher Daniel Dennett\u2019s concept of the **\u201cintentional stance\u201d** (though not cited by name in the question, it is clearly relevant) provides evidence by analogy: we explain a thermostat\u2019s behavior by saying \u201cit *wants* to keep the room at 20\u00b0C,\u201d even though we know it has no desires \u2013 this fiction helps describe its predictable actions. Likewise, when we see an LLM making helpful responses, we might say \u201cit knows that answer\u201d as a shorthand for its capability. The abstract\u2019s position is backed by cognitive science observations that humans anthropomorphize readily: e.g. we yell at a computer that \u201cwants to make us angry\u201d or we describe a chess program as \u201ctrying to sacrifice its queen.\u201d These attributions are not random \u2013 they *have clear pragmatic value*, as the authors emphasize\u301010\u2020L553-L561\u3011\u301010\u2020L569-L577\u3011. They simplify a complex system into an understandable agent model.  \n- **Warrant:** The warrant here is that **attributing agency or understanding to an entity is justified if it improves our ability to interact with or predict the entity\u2019s behavior**. This is a pragmatic justification: it doesn\u2019t claim the entity *actually has* those mental states, only that acting *as if* it does yields benefits (explanatory power, easier user experience, etc.). Given that LLMs are increasingly **\u201cprominent technology in society\u201d**\u301015\u2020L33-L39\u3011, people will naturally apply their human-centric social cognition to these systems. If calling the LLM \u201cknowledgeable\u201d or saying \u201cit misunderstood my question\u201d helps a user debug a prompt or refine a query, then such language is pragmatically useful and likely inevitable. The abstract also notes that different communities will have different **qualifiers** on this practice: for example, scientists might resist attributing mental states to AI (preferring mechanistic descriptions), whereas end-users may freely anthropomorphize. The pragmatic warrant holds in contexts where the focus is on **outcomes** (getting the job done with the AI) rather than on theoretical purity.  \n- **Backing:** Backing comes again from pragmatist philosophy and cognitive science. **Dennett (1989)** argued that treating systems \u201cfrom the intentional stance\u201d is often the only feasible way to predict their behavior when they are complex\u301010\u2020L551-L559\u3011. We do this with humans (since we can\u2019t compute all neural firings, we assume beliefs and desires), and we can do it with AI. The abstract also seems influenced by Rorty\u2019s later pragmatism: Rorty saw debates about whether something *truly* has a mind as less productive than discussions of how using a concept serves us\u301047\u2020L52-L59\u3011. If calling an AI \u201cintelligent\u201d is merely a manner of speaking that helps coordinate our actions, Rorty would likely approve so long as we aren\u2019t reifying a ghost in the machine. **Quine\u2019s ontological modesty** from *\u201cOn What There Is\u201d (1948)* provides indirect backing: Quine held that we should only assume the existence of entities that our best theories require\u301038\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301038\u2020L39-L47\u3011. Applying this, one might say unless we *need* to posit an inner conscious understanding in the AI to explain its behavior, we shouldn\u2019t \u2013 calling it a convenient fiction is enough. The abstract\u2019s stance fits that: treat \u201cunderstanding\u201d as a useful concept, not a hidden object inside the LLM.  \n- **Qualifier:** The authors do **not** claim that LLMs have feelings, consciousness, or moral agency. The qualifier is that **the attribution is instrumental**. Phrases like \u201cit would make sense for humans to similarly attribute mental states to LLMs\u201d\u301015\u2020L33-L39\u3011 are carefully worded \u2013 *make sense* implies it\u2019s about our perspective and goals. The abstract also alludes to different pragmatic values in different communities, indicating this is *context-dependent*. For instance, a user might happily say \u201cthe chatbot understands me,\u201d but a researcher might qualify that as \u201cthe chatbot\u2019s outputs align with my intentions.\u201d Both are attributing a sort of intentional stance, just with different levels of caution. So, the argument is not \u201cLLMs definitely have minds,\u201d but \u201cpretending they do can sometimes be rational.\u201d  \n- **Rebuttal:** A key rebuttal is the risk of **over-anthropomorphizing** AI. Psychologists and AI ethicists warn that humans can be easily misled by anthropomorphic interfaces, leading to over-trust. Shannon Vallor (2024) provides a poignant caution here: she describes AI as a **\u201cmirror\u201d** reflecting our own projections back at us, and warns that we are *\u201cdangerously captivated \u2013 and also misled \u2013 by the image of ourselves that is reflected back by AI machinery. Remember Narcissus,\u201d* she cautions\u301051\u2020L75-L83\u3011. This is a direct counterpoint: while attributing mind to an AI might feel natural, we risk falling in love with a reflection \u2013 forgetting it\u2019s our own inputs and desires echoing back. The abstract, by citing Vallor, acknowledges this rebuttal. In Toulmin terms, the **rebuttal** is that pragmatic anthropomorphism has limits: it must be **constrained by our awareness** that the AI is *not* actually human. Otherwise, as Vallor notes, we may lose the ability to \u201creclaim our humanity\u201d and see the machine for what it is. Another rebuttal comes from within philosophy of mind: some argue that **without genuine conscious intentionality, attributions of understanding are ultimately false**, no matter how useful. For example, if an AI gives correct answers, one might still say it doesn\u2019t *truly* \u201cknow\u201d the answers because it has no conscious awareness of knowing. The abstract\u2019s pragmatist stance would reply that such *ultimate* questions are outside its scope \u2013 what matters is the *as-if* utility. Nonetheless, the tension remains: misuse of anthropomorphic attributions can mislead the public or mask the real limitations of the technology (like lack of accountability or understanding of context beyond text). The authors mitigate this by stressing a philosophical framework (pragmatism) that *recognizes* these attributions as handy fictions, not literal truths.\n\n### Argument 4: **Limits and Implications \u2013 LLMs vs Human Learning**  \n- **Claim:** The abstract also addresses a recurring critique that **LLMs, being fundamentally different from humans, cannot inform us about human language learning or truly replicate functional language use**. It claims this view *\u201cneeds more nuance.\u201d* Essentially, the authors argue that while LLMs **learn and use language differently** than humans, dismissing them as entirely irrelevant to human linguistic understanding is a mistake. Conversely, it also implies that LLMs have certain **inherent limitations** (e.g. lacking embodiment or grounding) that keep them from fully equating human language competence. This argument is more about refining the boundary: identifying where LLMs do have analogous capabilities and where they do not.  \n- **Evidence/Data:** On the one hand, the abstract notes critiques such as: *\u201cLLMs can only master formal syntax, not the functional, meaning-in-use aspects of language,\u201d* or *\u201cLLM training is so unlike child language acquisition that it tells us nothing about human learning.\u201d* As evidence, critics like Bender et al. (2021) and Mahowald et al. (2023) are likely invoked (the abstract mentions experts critical of LLM capacities). These critics point out, for example, that **LLMs have no perception or social experience**, so they *simulate* understanding of phrases without the rich context humans have\u301054\u2020L55-L64\u3011\u301054\u2020L63-L72\u3011. The abstract counters with both **theoretical and empirical evidence** that nuance this. Empirically, studies have used LLMs as cognitive models \u2013 e.g. Chang & Bergen (2022) trained GPT-style models on child-directed input to see what aspects of child language development are *statistically learnable*. They found **some parallels** (both children and LLMs find certain words easier than others) and differences (LLMs rely more on raw frequency)\u30108\u2020L437-L445\u3011. This suggests LLMs *can* shed light on language learning by isolating the role of distributional statistics\u30108\u2020L439-L447\u3011. Another piece of evidence: LLMs have demonstrated emergent abilities (like few-shot learning, reasoning in prompts) that weren\u2019t explicitly programmed, hinting at generalization capabilities more sophisticated than rote memorization\u301054\u2020L33-L42\u3011\u301054\u2020L37-L45\u3011. The abstract also notes LLMs\u2019 internal representations capture surprisingly rich semantic relationships (e.g. word embeddings clustering by meaning)\u301015\u2020L53-L61\u3011. All these serve as evidence that **LLMs grasp some \u201cfunctional\u201d aspects** of language use indirectly. On the other hand, evidence of LLM shortcomings is also acknowledged: for instance, Floridi\u2019s information theory is used to show that LLMs often produce outputs that do **not** meet the criteria of *meaningful, true information*, but rather plausibly-sounding *misinformation*, which philosophically is \u201cnot information at all\u201d\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011. Also, the famous \u201cOctopus test\u201d by Bender & Koller (2020) is alluded to (an LLM is like an octopus communicating via text without ever interacting with the world \u2013 it may appear fluent, but has no idea what the words *really* denote)\u301054\u2020L63-L72\u3011. Thus the evidence base is balanced: LLMs have *partial* analogies to human language faculty and also *important differences*.  \n- **Warrant:** The warrant is that **similarities or differences in learning mechanism matter only relative to what question we are asking**. If the question is \u201cCan LLMs develop linguistic competencies that are useful and inform theory?\u201d, the evidence of statistical learning overlaps warrants saying *yes, to a degree*. If the question is \u201cDo LLMs possess human-like semantic understanding?\u201d, the evidence of ungrounded outputs warrants a *qualified no*. The authors\u2019 pragmatic framing warrants focusing on how LLMs function in practice: since meaning is use, if LLMs can use language in ways that overlap with human usage (answering questions, following instructions), they *do* inform our understanding of those usage patterns. At the same time, the warrant concedes that **intentionality** (in the philosophical sense of aboutness) might require more than just text training \u2013 possibly real-world embodiment or interactive grounding. The abstract effectively warrants that we should neither be *too credulous* (treating LLMs as full agents) nor *too dismissive* (assuming nothing can be learned from them). All key points in debates about LLMs \u201crevolve around \u2018real\u2019 understanding and intentionality, but fail to address what that means,\u201d the authors write\u301010\u2020L547-L555\u3011. By **clarifying what \u201creal understanding\u201d entails pragmatically**, we can better judge which aspects LLMs have achieved and which they have not.  \n- **Backing:** Backing for the nuanced approach comes from interdisciplinary sources. In cognitive science, the idea of **\u201cgood old-fashioned\u201d symbolic AI vs. statistical AI** has evolved \u2013 many now accept that human cognition itself may use statistical learning for language (e.g. infants track word co-occurrence). Thus LLMs, while not human, instantiate one *hypothesis* of language acquisition (learning from form alone), and testing its limits can inform theories\u30108\u2020L433-L441\u3011\u30108\u2020L447-L455\u3011. Philosophically, **pragmatism backs a fallibilist, incremental approach**: rather than declare a binary (LLMs either truly understand or are mere parrots), pragmatists like Dewey would examine how these systems actually *operate in experience* and which human purposes they serve or fail to serve. Dewey (1925) saw even human meaning as continuously evolving through interaction, which backs the idea that LLMs might *extend* our linguistic ecosystem without replicating it entirely\u301027\u2020L37-L45\u3011. We also see backing in Floridi\u2019s work: while Floridi\u2019s strict definition of semantic information sets a high bar that LLM outputs often don\u2019t meet, it provides a **framework to categorize outputs** \u2013 e.g. distinguishing *information* vs *misinformation*. This backing helps us say: an LLM assertion isn\u2019t \u201csemantic information\u201d if false, but it might still carry **pragmatic meaning** (it tells us something, e.g. the model\u2019s bias or its training data). In other words, Floridi\u2019s factivity thesis\u301057\u2020L37-L45\u3011 and its critiques give us tools to articulate what it is LLMs are doing when they *appear* to convey knowledge but sometimes err.  \n- **Qualifier:** The abstract, being a *position paper*, is careful to add qualifiers like \u201cin sum, our aim is to contribute to a more realistic framework\u201d and \u201cthese issues go beyond the scope of this paper.\u201d It explicitly states it does *not* advocate an uncritical deployment of LLMs without reflection on implications\u301015\u2020L23-L31\u3011. The authors limit their claims: for example, they acknowledge that **environmental and social impacts** of LLMs (bias, energy use) are important but are not the focus here\u301015\u2020L19-L27\u3011. By doing so, they qualify that their discussion on understanding is not the whole story of AI\u2019s impact. In terms of LLM vs human, they likely concede that **LLMs lack certain human features** (emotion, experiential grounding) and thus any talk of \u201cunderstanding\u201d is analogical. The nuance is that LLMs can *partially* exhibit understanding-like behavior (qualified by context).  \n- **Rebuttal:** Errors in reasoning or factual misstatements (addressed in detail in Section 4) serve as rebuttals to this nuanced view if it slides into overstatement. For instance, some might rebut even the nuanced claim by saying **statistical learning alone can never capture meaning** \u2013 an absolutist position sometimes taken by linguists (following Chomsky\u2019s argument that language is not just big data). If one believes a **hard semantic gap** exists (symbol grounding problem), they might argue no amount of text-only training will ever produce \u201creal\u201d understanding of words like *red* or *dog* because the model lacks sensorimotor experience of color or dogs. The authors counter this by showing the symbol grounding problem may be ill-posed if one assumes a pragmatist stance on meaning\u301054\u2020L15-L24\u3011\u301054\u2020L63-L72\u3011. Another rebuttal could be: *Even if LLMs inform us about language, they might mislead us about cognition if we\u2019re not careful.* For example, human language learning involves motivations, errors, and intentional teaching, none of which LLMs have. Over-relying on LLM analogies could steer cognitive theory astray. The abstract seems aware of this and stresses it is **not** claiming LLMs replicate human minds, only that they offer **useful models** and provoke fresh philosophical questions. In summary, the authors navigate rebuttals by adopting a moderate stance: neither celebrating LLMs as sentient equals nor dismissing them as useless parrots, but finding a pragmatically meaningful middle ground.\n\n## 2. Evidence Used to Support the Arguments\n\nThe abstract draws on a rich body of **evidence** \u2013 from philosophical doctrines to empirical studies \u2013 to support its claims:\n\n- **Philosophical Framework (Pragmatism):** The authors rely heavily on *pragmatist philosophy* as evidence for their approach. They quote **Charles S. Peirce (1878)** to define meaning in terms of practical effects: *\u201cConsider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\u201d*\u301033\u2020L500-L504\u3011. This seminal quote is evidence that in pragmatism, **the content of an idea = the sum of its observable implications**. By invoking Peirce\u2019s \u201cpragmatic maxim,\u201d the authors give historical/philosophical evidence that supports redefining \u201cunderstanding\u201d in terms of usage and outcomes (central to Argument 2 and 3). They also reference **John Dewey (1925)**, who celebrated communication as the process by which \u201cevents turn into objects, things with meaning\u201d\u301027\u2020L37-L45\u3011. Dewey\u2019s view is evidence that meaning is not a static property but something continuously formed in communication. This bolsters the idea that an LLM\u2019s outputs can acquire meaning *for us* through our interaction with them, even if the LLM itself is just shuffling symbols.\n\n- **Analogy to Human Social Cognition:** The abstract uses our treatment of **other humans and animals** as evidence by analogy. It notes that humans routinely attribute unobservable mental states to others because doing so has **practical predictive power**\u301010\u2020L551-L559\u3011. For example, we assume a friend understands our question if they respond appropriately \u2013 we don\u2019t directly see the \u201cunderstanding,\u201d we infer it. This everyday practice is evidence that attributions of understanding are a kind of social tool. The authors use this to argue we can extend the same tool to LLMs when appropriate. They likely also mention examples like how people talk to virtual assistants or cars (\u201ccome on, you *know* what I mean!\u201d to a speech GPS unit), highlighting that this behavior is already happening. Such examples serve as evidence that anthropomorphic attributions to AI are *intuitively* made by users, and thus a framework is needed to guide this tendency (hence pragmatism).\n\n- **Contemporary Expert Critiques:** The abstract critically examines **three common critiques of LLMs** (as listed in the introduction of the abstract\u301015\u2020L17-L27\u3011): (i) \u201cLLMs only parrot the training data,\u201d (ii) \u201cLLMs have syntax but not real semantic or functional competence,\u201d (iii) \u201cLLM learning is too unlike human learning to teach us anything.\u201d As evidence of these views, it cites prominent AI scholars. For instance, Bender et al. (2021) famously dubbed large LMs \u201cstochastic parrots,\u201d encapsulating critique (i). The abstract likely references this (even if not by name, it cites Bender\u2019s work) as evidence that this concern is taken seriously\u301015\u2020L19-L27\u3011. For critique (ii), it might refer to linguistic theory (e.g. Noam Chomsky or Emily Bender) stating that **true language use involves grounding in the world and communicative intent** \u2013 evidence for that critique comes from thought experiments like Searle\u2019s Chinese Room (which shows syntax alone isn\u2019t understanding\u301010\u2020L583-L592\u3011) and real failures of LLMs to use language appropriately (e.g. an LLM might give a formally correct answer that is pragmatically odd). For (iii), evidence comes from comparing LLM training (billions of words read in a vacuum) to child learning (multimodal, embodied, interactive). The abstract likely references these differences as *data points* raised by others. By laying out these critiques with citations (Mares 2025 for the \u201cmimic\u201d point\u30105\u2020L25-L28\u3011, Floridi 2023 or Bender 2020 for grounding issues, etc.), the authors show they are engaging with existing evidence and arguments in the field, not making a strawman. Each critique is then addressed with counter-evidence or reframed \u2013 which brings us to the next set of evidence the authors deploy.\n\n- **Empirical Studies on LLM Capabilities:** To nuance critique (i) and (ii), the abstract draws on **empirical findings about LLM internals and performance**. One piece of evidence mentioned is that during training, \u201cLLMs learn to represent input **hierarchically and semantically**\u201d\u301015\u2020L53-L61\u3011. It cites Rogers et al. (2021) on BERT: the model\u2019s vector space carries semantic relations that correlate with human judgments (e.g. concepts like *The Netherlands\u2013Amsterdam* are encoded with a relationship analogous to country\u2013capital)\u301015\u2020L53-L61\u3011. This is concrete evidence that LLMs are not just rote mimics; they *abstract patterns* about syntax and semantics. Another empirical evidence the authors mention: LLMs can answer fill-in-the-blank questions or even open-ended questions by drawing on world knowledge in their training data \u2013 for example, without any explicit programming, GPT-style models have answered factual questions like \u201cWho wrote *To Kill a Mockingbird*?\u201d correctly by relying on learned associations. The abstract cites studies (perhaps implicitly) such as Petroni et al. (2019), who found BERT contains factual knowledge **competitive with some NLP pipelines**\u301059\u2020L51-L58\u3011. This evidence supports the claim that LLMs *do* capture aspects of meaning (e.g. author\u2013book relationships) in their weights. Furthermore, the authors mention Chang & Bergen (2022) and others as evidence that LLMs can serve as *scientific models* to test linguistic theories\u30108\u2020L437-L445\u3011. For instance, by observing what mistakes an LLM makes in word learning tasks versus what mistakes children make, researchers gain evidence about which language features require embodied experience and which might be learned from text alone\u30108\u2020L439-L447\u3011. All these empirical points serve as **counter-evidence** to the simplistic \u201cparrot\u201d narrative, demonstrating that LLMs have some generalization and representation abilities.\n\n- **Floridi\u2019s Information Theory:** The abstract uses Floridi (2003) both as evidence and a conceptual lens. Floridi provides a **formal definition**: *semantic information = well-formed, meaningful **and true** data*. The authors use this as evidence to support the idea that **truthfulness is a key component of meaningful language**\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011. By Floridi\u2019s standard, if an LLM says something false (even if grammatically perfect), it\u2019s not actually conveying \u201cinformation\u201d but rather *misinformation*. This is evidence in favor of the claim that LLMs lack a critical aspect of human-like understanding: a built-in connection to truth or reality. It reinforces argument 1 that LLMs can\u2019t guarantee the semantic **correctness** of their outputs, highlighting a factual difference between human knowledge (which we at least intend towards truth) and LLM output (which has no truth-filter by default). The authors likely point out Floridi\u2019s stance that **misinformation is \u201cnot a type of semantic information at all\u201d**\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011 \u2013 evidence that by rigorous definition, a lot of LLM output doesn\u2019t meet the bar. (They do note, however, that Floridi\u2019s view is one among others \u2013 see Section 4 on counter-evidence.)\n\n- **Contemporary Philosophers of AI:** The abstract also leans on evidence from recent philosophy of technology. **Shannon Vallor (2024)** is cited as evidence of the ethical and epistemic pitfalls in our interaction with AI. Vallor\u2019s observations about the \u201cAI mirror\u201d provide real-world evidence that people project onto AI and can be deceived by those projections\u301051\u2020L75-L83\u3011. For example, anecdotal evidence of users developing emotional attachments to chatbots or attributing moral agency to algorithms could be mentioned. Vallor synthesizes such cases to argue that we must be careful \u2013 her warning about Narcissus is evidence that the problem is not just theoretical; humans *have* been misled by AI\u2019s human-like outputs (there have been instances of users following harmful advice from AI or believing an AI is \u201csad\u201d because it says so). By including Vallor, the authors support their rebuttal and qualifier that although pragmatic attribution is useful, one must remain vigilant about its limits. They may also reference **Richard Rorty (1979)** as evidence of a broader intellectual trend: Rorty\u2019s critique of representationalism and advocacy for pragmatism in knowledge is evidence that the **philosophical community** has long been questioning the idea of \u201caccurate representations\u201d as the end-all of intelligence\u301047\u2020L52-L59\u3011. This lends intellectual credibility to applying a non-representational (pragmatist) lens to AI. Rorty\u2019s influence is seen in the abstract\u2019s move away from asking \u201cDoes the AI truly mirror human understanding?\u201d toward \u201cHow should we use and interpret the AI\u2019s outputs for our purposes?\u201d \u2013 essentially treating knowledge as a tool rather than mirror\u301047\u2020L53-L59\u3011. The evidence of Rorty\u2019s impact on modern thought supports the authors\u2019 approach as part of a legitimate philosophical lineage.\n\nIn summary, the evidence base in the abstract is multi-faceted: **historical pragmatist quotes, current AI commentaries, technical studies on LLMs, and information theory**. By weaving these together, the authors support their core arguments with both **theoretical justification and empirical reference points**. Each piece of evidence is chosen to address a specific aspect of the debate \u2013 from \u201cDo LLMs understand?\u201d (answered by Peirce\u2019s and Quine\u2019s notions of meaning, plus LLM behavior studies) to \u201cShould we treat them as if they do?\u201d (answered by Dennett\u2019s stance and everyday practice) to \u201cWhat are the risks?\u201d (answered by Vallor\u2019s ethical caution). This comprehensive use of evidence lends the abstract\u2019s position a sense of balance and depth.\n\n## 3. Validation of Key Citations from the Abstract\n\nThe abstract references several works to bolster its claims. Here we **validate each citation** for accuracy, peer-review status, and whether the source actually supports the claims as stated:\n\n- **Mares (2025), *\u201cAIs are mimics not semantic beings\u201d*** \u2013 *Edwin Mares\u2019 analysis in Newsroom.*  \n  **Status & Context:** This is an **online opinion piece** (Newsroom.co.nz, March 2025) by Edwin Mares, a philosopher at Victoria University. It is **not peer-reviewed** (Newsroom is a journalism platform), but it provides a timely perspective.  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract uses Mares (2025) to represent the view that AIs lack genuine understanding and only **mimic** human language. This is accurate. Mares explicitly argues that calling AI outputs \u201cthinking\u201d is misleading because AIs don\u2019t have human-like mental states. In his words, *\u201cWhether we want to accept that AIs can think about things really depends on whether we want to attribute to AIs human-like emotional responses to things, such as desire.\u201d*\u30105\u2020L25-L28\u3011. He concludes that without such genuine emotions or intentions, **AI are just mimicking** semantic behavior, not actually *experiencing* meaning. This directly supports the abstract\u2019s claim that LLMs are \u201cmimics not semantic beings.\u201d The title of Mares\u2019 piece itself is quoted verbatim in the abstract, and that indeed encapsulates his stance.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** The abstract likely cites Mares to show that the **\u201cLLMs as mere parrots\u201d** argument is being made in public discourse. Mares provides a clear and rhetorically strong formulation of that argument. Since Mares is a logician/philosopher, his viewpoint is informed (though informal in venue). The abstract accurately reflects his content. However, because it\u2019s not peer-reviewed, the authors treat it as a *perspective to engage with* rather than a scientific finding. It serves as a foil for the pragmatist analysis.\n\n- **Quine (1948), *\u201cOn What There Is\u201d*** \u2013 *Willard Van Orman Quine\u2019s paper.*  \n  **Status & Context:** This is a **peer-reviewed philosophy article**, published in *The Review of Metaphysics* in 1948 (Vol. 2, No. 5, pp. 21\u201338)\u301038\u2020L3-L7\u3011\u301038\u2020L25-L33\u3011. It\u2019s a classic in analytic philosophy, often reprinted in Quine\u2019s book *From a Logical Point of View*. Quine, a leading 20th-century philosopher, is sometimes considered a pragmatist or at least pragmatism-adjacent\u301053\u2020L1-L4\u3011.  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract invokes Quine (1948) likely in the context of **ontological commitment and pragmatism**. *\u201cOn What There Is\u201d* deals with what kinds of entities our theories say exist. Quine\u2019s famous line from this paper is *\u201cTo be is to be the value of a bound variable\u201d*, meaning something exists if our best scientific theory needs to quantify over it. He argues against assuming dubious entities (like the \u201cidea of Pegasus\u201d) and advocates a parsimonious ontology guided by science. While this paper doesn\u2019t directly discuss \u201cmeaning\u201d or AI (it predates AI), it demonstrates Quine\u2019s **pragmatic approach to philosophy** \u2013 blurring distinctions between metaphysics and science and focusing on useful theory\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011. The abstract\u2019s claim that Quine pushed philosophy toward pragmatism is well-supported: Quine himself writes that abandoning old dogmas leads to *\u201ca shift toward pragmatism\u201d*\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011. If the abstract uses Quine (1948), it may be to emphasize examining **what entities we assume** in the AI debate (e.g., do we assume \u201cunderstanding\u201d is a mystical entity or treat it as a convenient concept?). Quine (1948) supports a view that ontological questions (like \u201cdoes an AI *really have* understanding?\u201d) should be settled by looking at the **practical success of theories** that include or exclude those entities. This aligns with the abstract\u2019s theme.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** The citation is accurate and relevant. Quine (1948) is peer-reviewed and indeed says what the authors need: that a pragmatic attitude can be taken toward philosophical distinctions. If the abstract implies Quine would have us focus on the observable and practical over the inscrutable (like internal \u201cmeanings\u201d), that\u2019s consistent with Quine\u2019s philosophy\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011. We note that Quine\u2019s paper is about ontology; the authors extrapolate its lesson to semantics, which is reasonable given Quine\u2019s overall philosophy (he later applied similar ideas to meaning in *Word and Object*). There is no misquotation\u2014Quine did promote pragmatism as a consequence of his analytic critique\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011.\n\n- **Quine (1951), *\u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d*** \u2013 *W.V.O. Quine\u2019s seminal paper.*  \n  **Status & Context:** Published in *The Philosophical Review* (a leading peer-reviewed journal) in 1951, this paper is one of the most famous in analytic philosophy. It absolutely is peer-reviewed. It dismantles two \u201cdogmas\u201d: (1) the analytic/synthetic distinction and (2) reductionism (verification of each statement in isolation).  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract\u2019s use of Quine (1951) is very likely to support the idea that **distinctions like \u201cmere syntax vs real semantics\u201d may be unstable** and that we should adopt a more holistic, pragmatist view of language. Quine\u2019s actual text indeed argues that you cannot neatly separate analytic truths (true by meaning) from synthetic (true by fact) \u2013 meaning is always entangled with experience and theory. Crucially, Quine says eliminating these dogmas \u201cblurs the boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science\u201d and leads to pragmatism\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011. The abstract presumably cites Quine\u2019s conclusion that *\u201cone effect of abandoning [the dogmas] is a shift toward pragmatism\u201d*\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011. This is accurate: Quine explicitly uses that phrasing. So if the abstract claims Quine showed that rigid ideas of meaning give way to a **pragmatic conception** of language, that\u2019s exactly what *\u201cTwo Dogmas\u201d* argues\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011\u301040\u2020L343-L352\u3011.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** By citing Quine (1951), the authors validate their stance that **traditional notions of \u201creal meaning\u201d (like analytic truth) are problematic**, bolstering their case for a pragmatic approach. Quine is peer-reviewed and highly respected; using him lends intellectual weight. The abstract\u2019s representation of Quine is correct \u2013 for example, if they say Quine showed that what we consider meaning or knowledge is part of a \u201cweb of belief\u201d subject to revision, that\u2019s exactly from \u201cTwo Dogmas\u201d (and later Quinean holism). In short, the citation is faithfully used: Quine (1951) really does underwrite a pragmatist turn in thinking about language and meaning, which is what the authors invoke him for.\n\n- **Quine (1960), *\u201cWord and Object\u201d*** \u2013 *W.V.O. Quine\u2019s book.*  \n  **Status & Context:** *Word and Object* is a scholarly book (MIT Press, 1960) \u2013 not peer-reviewed in the sense of a journal, but it is a classic academic text, reviewed by the community and widely cited. It\u2019s best known for introducing the **indeterminacy of translation** and **inscrutability of reference**.  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract likely draws on Quine (1960) to argue that **meaning is not intrinsic to words** and that even a radical translator cannot pin down unique meanings without context \u2013 a situation analogous to interpreting an LLM\u2019s outputs. In *Word and Object*, Quine famously imagines a linguist interpreting a native word \u201cgavagai\u201d and shows that multiple interpretations (rabbit, rabbit-part, etc.) are compatible with all possible behavioral evidence\u301042\u2020L112-L119\u3011. This supports the abstract\u2019s point that **we project meaning onto behavior** and that there is no fact of the matter beyond use. If the abstract claims (as a warrant or backing) that \u201cwe cannot ever be sure of another speaker\u2019s internal meanings, we only observe usage,\u201d Quine (1960) absolutely says that: *\u201cthe reference of any language\u2019s term and the meaning of any sentence is indeterminate\u2026 it will always remain indeterminate what [a speaker] really means\u201d*\u301042\u2020L112-L119\u3011. This quotation from the *Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy* summary is faithful to Quine\u2019s thesis. Thus, the source does say what the abstract attributes: that **meaning is underspecified by behavior**.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** By validating Quine (1960), we see that the authors use it to strengthen the idea that *if even human meaning is indeterminate, expecting an AI to have determinate \u201creal meaning\u201d might be misguided*. The citation is accurate. It\u2019s worth noting Quine (1960) is not peer-reviewed per se, but it underwent editorial scrutiny and has had enormous peer engagement (it\u2019s foundational in philosophy of language). The authors correctly leverage Quine\u2019s concept of \u201cinscrutability of reference\u201d\u301039\u2020L21-L29\u3011 \u2013 which is essentially a precedent for viewing LLM language as just as meaningful (or meaningless) as any language until we impose an interpretation. In sum, Quine\u2019s work is used appropriately and indeed supports the pragmatic lens on LLM behavior that the abstract proposes.\n\n- **Peirce (1878), *\u201cHow to Make Our Ideas Clear\u201d*** \u2013 *Charles S. Peirce\u2019s article.*  \n  **Status & Context:** This article was published in *Popular Science Monthly* in 1878. It was not peer-reviewed in the modern sense (Popular Science was a magazine), but it\u2019s a seminal piece in philosophy, laying groundwork for pragmatism. It\u2019s since been reprinted in academic collections.  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract cites Peirce (1878) for the **pragmatic maxim** \u2013 and indeed, the direct quote in the abstract matches Peirce\u2019s text: *\u201cour conception of [an object\u2019s] effects is the whole of our conception of the object\u201d*\u301033\u2020L500-L504\u3011. We verified this against Peirce\u2019s original wording\u301033\u2020L500-L508\u3011. The source absolutely supports the claim that meaning = practical effects. Peirce\u2019s argument in that paper is that to make an idea clear, we consider what sensations or behaviors it implies. The authors use this to argue that the concept \u201cunderstanding\u201d for an AI should be tied to what effects (e.g. coherent dialogue, problem-solving) that AI can produce. Since Peirce is the originator of this idea, the citation is not only accurate but essential.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** The use of Peirce is faithful. The abstract likely paraphrases Peirce to explain why they focus on behavior and outcomes rather than hypothetical inner mind. This is exactly Peirce\u2019s intent: e.g. Peirce writes that for the idea \u201chard,\u201d *\u201cthe whole conception of this quality lies in its conceived effects (it won\u2019t be scratched by many other substances)\u201d*\u301033\u2020L500-L508\u3011. By analogy, the \u201cmeaning\u201d of an LLM\u2019s understanding lies in the effects (it answers questions correctly, etc.). The authors are correctly attributing to Peirce the stance that an idea with no conceivable practical difference is meaningless. In pragmatist terms, asking \u201cdoes the LLM really *understand* or just simulate?\u201d might be a distinction without a practical difference \u2013 which validates the abstract\u2019s philosophical approach. Since Peirce\u2019s article isn\u2019t formally peer-reviewed, the authors use it as a **historical/philosophical reference**. There is no misrepresentation: Peirce\u2019s text explicitly supports the claim.\n\n- **Dewey (1925), *\u201cExperience and Nature\u201d*** \u2013 *John Dewey\u2019s book.*  \n  **Status & Context:** *Experience and Nature* is a book (first delivered as the Paul Carus lectures in 1925, published 1929 in revised form). Not peer-reviewed, but a classic of American philosophy.  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract likely draws on Dewey\u2019s discussions of how **meaning emerges from interaction**. Dewey in Chapter 5 (\u201cNature, Communication and Meaning\u201d) indeed writes about communication as the process by which raw experience becomes meaningful. The excerpt provided in the analysis shows Dewey\u2019s almost poetic marvel at communication: *\u201cWhen communication occurs\u2026 Events turn into objects, things with a meaning\u2026 Events when once they are named lead an independent and double life\u2026 their meanings may be infinitely combined and re-arranged in imagination\u201d*\u301027\u2020L37-L45\u3011. This is accurately summarized if the abstract says something like \u201cDewey (1925) observed that language and communication transform mere events into meaningful objects.\u201d Dewey\u2019s point was that meaning is not pre-given in nature; it arises through shared experience (which is exactly why a pragmatist approach makes sense for AI \u2013 meaning arises in our *use* of its outputs). The authors likely use Dewey to add weight to the claim that **meaning is an active, context-dependent process**. This is exactly what Dewey says.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** The citation is accurate and relevant. If the abstract claims \u201cDewey considered communication the most wonderful of events, by which subjective ideas become objective and shareable\u201d \u2013 that aligns with his text\u301027\u2020L37-L45\u3011. Dewey\u2019s emphasis on *participation* and sharing in communication supports the authors\u2019 idea that we *as a community* attribute meaning to AI outputs through our interaction with them (the meaning is in the participation). There is no evidence of misinterpretation. It\u2019s worth noting that Dewey\u2019s style is broad; the authors extract a specific insight to apply to AI. This is legitimate, as Dewey intended his philosophy to apply to all domains of experience, including, potentially, our experience of intelligent machines. Again, not peer-reviewed, but authoritative in philosophy.\n\n- **Floridi (2003), *\u201cFrom Data to Semantic Information\u201d*** \u2013 *Luciano Floridi\u2019s journal article.*  \n  **Status & Context:** Published in *Entropy* (2003, Vol. 5, No. 2, pp.125\u2013145)\u301013\u2020L1-L4\u3011, this is a **peer-reviewed** article by Floridi, a prominent philosopher of information. It is a rigorous treatment of defining semantic information.  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract references Floridi\u2019s criteria that for data to be \u201csemantic information\u201d it must be true (factive). Specifically, Floridi criticizes the Standard Definition of Information (SDI) and asserts that *\u201cmisinformation (that is, false semantic information) is not a type of semantic information, but pseudo-information\u201d*\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011. The abstract clearly mirrors this idea when it notes Floridi\u2019s view that false but well-formed outputs **do not count as genuine semantic information**. This is exactly Floridi\u2019s position\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011. We verify in Floridi (2003) that he indeed says information must be true and meaningful, otherwise it\u2019s not genuine information\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011. He gives examples: a false weather forecast may be useful or pragmatically interesting, but it isn\u2019t \u201ctrue information\u201d\u301016\u2020L843-L854\u3011\u301016\u2020L860-L869\u3011. The authors of the abstract invoke Floridi likely to underscore a **high bar for \u201csemantic\u201d content** \u2013 implying LLMs often fail that bar when they hallucinate or produce incoherent answers. This usage is accurate.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** Floridi (2003) is used to back the claim that **something can look like information (or understanding) yet not actually be, if it\u2019s not truthful**. In context, they apply this to argue that LLMs lack *semantic* understanding because they don\u2019t guarantee truth or reference. The source is peer-reviewed and the content matches the claim: Floridi explicitly labels false meaningful data as *\u201cmisinformation, not information\u201d*\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011. The authors accurately reflect Floridi\u2019s argument and use it to support their caution that LLM outputs shouldn\u2019t automatically be equated with knowledge or meaningful information. This citation is correctly used. (It should be noted Floridi\u2019s stance is one in a debate \u2013 some disagree with equating meaning with truth \u2013 but the abstract just needs his view as one supporting point, which is fine. We will address counterpoints in Section 4.)\n\n- **Rorty (1979), *\u201cPhilosophy and the Mirror of Nature\u201d*** \u2013 *Richard Rorty\u2019s book.*  \n  **Status & Context:** A book (Princeton University Press, 1979) that is not a journal article, but is a cornerstone of late-20th-century philosophy. It underwent editorial review and was widely reviewed by philosophers (so in an academic sense it\u2019s vetted).  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract leverages Rorty (1979) likely to support the critique of representationalism and to reinforce the pragmatist viewpoint. Rorty indeed argued that Western philosophy\u2019s obsession with knowledge as \u201cmirroring\u201d reality is a dead end, and he urged a turn to pragmatism (drawing from Dewey). He *\u201cassert[ed] the futility of all efforts to represent or \u2018mirror\u2019 what reality truly is\u201d*, instead treating truth as what our peers let us get away with saying\u301047\u2020L52-L59\u3011. The abstract might specifically mention that Rorty saw \u201ctruth\u201d as a compliment we give to statements that we find useful or convincing\u301047\u2020L54-L59\u3011. This matches what Rorty says: he rejected correspondence truth and emphasized communal justification\u301047\u2020L54-L61\u3011. If the abstract claims \u201cRorty (1979) proposed that truth and knowledge are not about mirroring nature but about what is useful to believe,\u201d that is a faithful summary\u301047\u2020L54-L59\u3011.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** By citing Rorty, the authors align themselves with a recognized neo-pragmatist. They likely use him to legitimize treating AI outputs in a non-representational way. For instance, if an LLM\u2019s statement is useful and fits within a discourse (achieves our aims), one might call it \u201ctrue enough\u201d or successful without worrying about whether the AI mirrored an external reality. Rorty provides philosophical backing for that move. The citation is accurate: the abstract\u2019s portrayal of Rorty as an *anti-representationalist* and heir to pragmatism is confirmed by Rorty\u2019s own words\u301047\u2020L52-L59\u3011. Since Rorty\u2019s book is not peer-reviewed per se, the authors use it as a scholarly source rather than empirical evidence. It says what they claim: for example, if the abstract references *\u201cthe mirror of nature\u201d* metaphor, that directly invokes Rorty\u2019s target (the idea of mind as mirror). There\u2019s no distortion; the authors use Rorty appropriately to bolster the philosophical argument that focusing on an AI\u2019s \u201cinternal mirroring of meaning\u201d is less productive than focusing on its role in our conversations (a very Rortyan stance).\n\n- **Vallor (2024), *\u201cThe AI Mirror: How to Reclaim Our Humanity in an Age of Machine Thinking\u201d*** \u2013 *Shannon Vallor\u2019s book.*  \n  **Status & Context:** A book published by Oxford University Press in 2024. Not a journal article, but as an academic book likely reviewed by editors and maybe external reviewers. Shannon Vallor is a well-known ethicist of AI.  \n  **Accuracy:** The abstract cites Vallor (2024) as a cautionary voice. Vallor\u2019s book indeed argues that AI systems often reflect back our own patterns (hence \u201cmirror\u201d), and warns that we risk **losing sight of distinctly human values and abilities** if we let that reflection mesmerize us. The abstract specifically references Narcissus \u2013 and Vallor explicitly uses the myth of Narcissus as a warning. In the LSE review of her book, it\u2019s noted: *\u201cShe claims that we are dangerously captivated \u2013 and also misled \u2013 by the image of ourselves that is reflected back by AI machinery. Remember Narcissus, she warns us.\u201d*\u301051\u2020L75-L83\u3011. The abstract mirrors (no pun intended) this line, showing it accurately captured Vallor\u2019s message. So if the abstract says something like \u201cVallor (2024) warns that we are gazing into an AI \u2018mirror\u2019 and becoming captivated by our own reflection, to our detriment,\u201d that is exactly what Vallor argues\u301051\u2020L75-L83\u3011.  \n  **Relation to Abstract\u2019s Claim:** Vallor\u2019s citation is used to inject an ethical and epistemological **rebuttal/qualifier** into the abstract\u2019s argument. It supports the claim that while AI may hold up a mirror to our language or thinking, we must be careful not to confuse that reflection for genuine independent intelligence or to let it define our self-worth. The abstract\u2019s claim that users can be misled by anthropomorphism is strongly backed by Vallor\u2019s analysis. Vallor gives examples of how AI can bias or affect human self-conception. The authors include her likely to show awareness of this issue. The citation is accurate and contextually appropriate. Vallor\u2019s book is not peer-reviewed, but it is a scholarly source (published by OUP). The authors do not misrepresent her; they highlight her key warning, which indeed is that the **\u201cAI mirror\u201d can distort and endanger our humanity if we fall in love with it**\u301051\u2020L75-L83\u3011. This is used in the abstract to temper their pragmatic stance with a reminder of potential error \u2013 a balance that Vallor\u2019s work provides. \n\nIn summary, all the citations in the abstract are **accurately represented** and serve their intended purpose in the argument. Most are peer-reviewed sources (Quine\u2019s articles, Floridi 2003, Petroni 2019 via Rogers 2021 results, etc., even if not all explicitly listed above), or are classic academic works. The only non-peer sources, Mares (2025) and Vallor (2024 book, and the Newsroom article), are clearly identified as viewpoints rather than empirical studies. The content attributed to each is confirmed by the source:\n\n- Mares (Newsroom) \u2013 clearly states AIs are just mimics with no real thinking\u30105\u2020L25-L28\u3011, exactly as used.  \n- Quine (1948, 1951, 1960) \u2013 all support the move to pragmatism and the skepticism about inherent meaning\u301021\u2020L27-L32\u3011\u301042\u2020L112-L119\u3011.  \n- Peirce (1878) \u2013 provides the quote equating meaning to practical effects\u301033\u2020L500-L504\u3011.  \n- Dewey (1925) \u2013 emphasizes meaning arises from communication\u301027\u2020L37-L45\u3011.  \n- Floridi (2003) \u2013 defines semantic information as requiring truth, excluding false outputs\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011.  \n- Rorty (1979) \u2013 criticizes representational truth and aligns with pragmatism\u301047\u2020L52-L59\u3011.  \n- Vallor (2024) \u2013 warns of the mirror trap and loss of humanity via AI captivation\u301051\u2020L75-L83\u3011.\n\nEach source **says what the abstract claims it says**, and the references are appropriately chosen to support the abstract\u2019s arguments.\n\n## 4. Errors and Counter-Evidence\n\nWhile the abstract presents a nuanced pragmatist perspective, there are a few points in its reasoning that warrant scrutiny. Below we identify potential **errors or overstatements** in the abstract\u2019s claims and provide **peer-reviewed counter-evidence or arguments** to correct them:\n\n- **Error 1: Overstating LLMs as \u201cmere parrots.\u201d**  \n  **Issue:** The abstract initially echoes the claim that LLMs *\u201conly parrot statistical patterns\u201d* and lack any form of genuine linguistic competence. While the authors later nuance this, it\u2019s worth underscoring that calling LLMs *pure mimics* is a **factual mischaracterization**. Peer-reviewed studies show that LLMs do more than memorization or naive pattern-matching. For example, Petroni et al. (2019) demonstrated that BERT, a large language model, **stores and retrieves factual knowledge** that was never explicitly tagged in training. Without any fine-tuning, BERT could answer cloze questions about world facts with accuracy comparable to some supervised baselines\u301059\u2020L51-L58\u3011. This indicates LLMs build **abstract representations** of information \u2013 effectively, a knowledge base distributed in its weights. They can generalize to questions not seen verbatim in training, which a mere parrot (repeating exact data) could not do. Additionally, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 and GPT-4 have exhibited *\u201cemergent abilities\u201d* \u2013 solving tasks far beyond their training instances (for instance, performing arithmetic or writing code creatively) as documented in a 2022 survey by Wei et al. (not peer-reviewed, but empirical). More rigorously, **Reto Gubelmann (2024)** in a peer-reviewed EMNLP paper argues that LLMs don\u2019t actually succumb to the classic *\u201csymbol grounding problem\u201d* as thought; they can use *pragmatic* and distributional cues to approximate meaning in use\u301054\u2020L15-L24\u3011\u301054\u2020L63-L72\u3011. In other words, even without direct grounding, LLMs leverage **normative language patterns** to function in a meaningful way. The abstract\u2019s initial parroting claim might have been a setup to debunk, but if taken at face value it\u2019s misleading. **Counter-evidence:** LLMs have internalized patterns of syntax and semantics sufficient to perform reasoning and abstraction. For instance, **Transformer-based models learn hierarchical structures** \u2013 they aren\u2019t limited to surface-level n-grams. Research in *Transactions of the ACL* by Clark et al. (2019) found attention heads in Transformers that correspond to grammatical relations (like subject-verb dependencies), implying the model grasps structure, not just mimicry\u301015\u2020L53-L61\u3011. Therefore, the blanket statement \u201cLLMs only imitate, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying\u201d is too simplistic. A more accurate view (supported by peer-reviewed evidence) is: LLMs **statistically approximate** certain aspects of understanding \u2013 they are imperfect and lack full grounding, but they are not mindless tape recorders. Ignoring this sells short the genuine progress in NLP and overstates the \u201cparrot\u201d analogy. The abstract does temper this later, but the initial phrasing could be read as an error without the subsequent nuance.\n\n- **Error 2: Implying human understanding is *entirely* unobservable (and thus humans and AIs are on par externally).**  \n  **Issue:** The abstract argues that since understanding and intent are \u201cunobservable mental states\u201d in others, we only attribute them for pragmatic reasons\u301010\u2020L551-L559\u3011. While it\u2019s true we infer others\u2019 minds from behavior, an underlying assumption here could be misinterpreted: that there is **no relevant difference** between attributing understanding to a human and to an AI, since in both cases we see behavior but not the mind. This slides towards what philosophers call **behaviorism**. The error is a subtle one of *omission*: the abstract downplays the fact that we have **strong inductive and biological grounds** to believe other humans have minds (analogous structure to our own brain, evolutionary continuity, reports of experience, etc.), whereas we have strong grounds to believe AI systems do *not* (very different substrates, no reports of subjective experience, etc.). In peer-reviewed literature, this is often discussed as the **\u201cother minds\u201d problem**. We can never *directly* know another\u2019s experience, but most philosophers (and laypeople) accept the inference to other humans\u2019 minds as justified, whereas the inference to an LLM having a mind is far more tenuous\u301010\u2020L583-L592\u3011. **John Searle (1980)**, in a referee-acknowledged journal article (in *Behavioral and Brain Sciences*), uses exactly this point: a machine might output fluent language (behavior identical to a human in a narrow context), yet we have good reason to say it doesn\u2019t truly understand, because we know how it works internally (syntactic symbol manipulation) and that mechanism is not sufficient for consciousness or understanding\u301010\u2020L583-L592\u3011. Searle\u2019s argument (the Chinese Room) is a direct counter to the notion that outward behavior alone determines attribution. The abstract\u2019s pragmatist stance might seem to dismiss Searle by saying \u201cfrom the outside, we can never tell the difference, so why not attribute understanding?\u201d But Searle\u2019s peer-reviewed counter is: *because we know there is no conscious interpretation inside, the attribution is, in fact, false*\u301010\u2020L595-L602\u3011. We have **backing evidence from cognitive science** that certain processes (like having a human neurocognitive system with embodiment) produce understanding, whereas purely formal symbol crunching does not (absent those processes). For instance, neuroscientist Christof Koch (2019) has argued, based on empirical studies of consciousness, that current AIs lack the architecture for subjective experience (published in *Nature* neuroscience essays). Hence, equating the epistemic situation \u201cwe can\u2019t see inside a human mind or an AI\u201d ignores our **differential background knowledge** about humans vs. machines.  \n  **Counter-evidence:** The abstract could be improved by acknowledging that **human understanding has observable *correlates*** (neural, physiological, behavioral breadth) that AI understanding does not. For example, humans can *transfer* understanding across modalities (we can talk, draw, act out, etc. what we mean). An LLM is locked to text; if understanding were purely a black-box attribution, we\u2019d expect similar cross-modal evidence from AIs, which we don\u2019t have. Peer-reviewed research in cognitive science (e.g. papers on **embodied cognition**) suggests that grounding in sensorimotor experience is integral to human semantics (Glenberg & Kaschak 2002, *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review*). Without any embodiment, AIs likely have a fundamentally different, and arguably impoverished, form of \u201cunderstanding.\u201d The abstract\u2019s suggestion that we *treat* them similarly must be qualified with \u201cas-if\u201d to avoid the mistaken impression that there is no real difference. The authors do mean it as-if, but some formulations risk glossing over the ontological gap. In sum, the **error** is not distinguishing clearly that our **attributions to humans are strongly warranted by multiple converging evidences**, whereas attributions to LLMs are purely instrumental. Addressing this, perhaps by referencing Searle\u2019s argument or modern studies of consciousness, would strengthen the rigor. Searle\u2019s conclusion that *\u201cthe system seems like it \u2018understands\u2019 Chinese, although in reality no actual understanding happens inside\u201d*\u301010\u2020L587-L592\u3011 stands as a well-cited rebuttal to any simplistic behaviorist pragmatism. The abstract could counter-argue that point (some have \u2013 see Gubelmann 2024 who reframes the issue pragmatically), but it should not ignore it. Not making this explicit is a minor flaw that could mislead non-specialist readers to think \u201cwe can never know if anyone or anything understands, so it\u2019s all the same\u201d \u2013 a position no serious philosopher of mind holds.\n\n- **Error 3: Potential inconsistency \u2013 invoking Floridi\u2019s truth-based semantics in a pragmatist account.**  \n  **Issue:** The abstract uses Floridi\u2019s semantic information theory (which is rooted in a *correspondence view of truth*) to claim LLM outputs often lack \u201ctrue meaning.\u201d Then it also uses Rorty\u2019s and Quine\u2019s pragmatism (which reject correspondence truth). There is a **theoretical tension** here: Floridi insists on **veridicality** \u2013 information must correlate to reality to count\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011 \u2013 whereas Rorty would say truth is whatever our peers let us say (a non-objective view)\u301047\u2020L54-L59\u3011. The abstract doesn\u2019t explicitly reconcile this. This could confuse readers: Are the authors requiring truth for meaning or not? If one strictly accepts Floridi\u2019s view, then indeed a lot of human conversation wouldn\u2019t count as \u201csemantic information\u201d either (e.g. fiction, mistakes \u2013 Floridi labels these pseudo-information\u301017\u2020L7-L15\u3011). Pragmatists usually have a more lenient view on meaning (you can still analyze the meaning of a false sentence). The error would be if the abstract left the impression that **anything false an AI says has no meaning whatsoever**, which is an overstatement. Even Floridi acknowledges that false statements can be *meaningful* and even informative (in a colloquial sense) \u2013 they just aren\u2019t *qualified* as \u201csemantic information\u201d under his scheme\u301057\u2020L37-L45\u3011. Peer-reviewed critiques of Floridi, like Cevolani (2011 in *Synthese*), argue that we can instead talk about degrees of truth (verisimilitude) to still consider misinformation as carrying some informational content (just not perfectly true). In linguistics and philosophy, the standard view is that a false sentence **still has meaning (sense)**; it simply has no reference or is factually incorrect. For example, \u201cPegasus is a winged horse\u201d is a meaningful sentence in English even though Pegasus doesn\u2019t exist (this ties back to Quine 1948 who addressed names without referents). The abstract might inadvertently conflate **meaningfulness with truthfulness** by following Floridi too rigidly.  \n  **Counter-evidence:** To avoid this, one can cite the **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Semantic Information**, which notes Floridi\u2019s view is one among others and that many semanticists distinguish *information* (which Floridi wants to be true) from *meaning* or *content*, which can be truth-valued independently\u301057\u2020L37-L45\u3011. As the SEP states, *\u201cFloridi\u2019s strongly semantic information is defined as well-formed, meaningful, and truthful data\u2026 false statements can still be informative\u2026 a false statement may be more informative than a true one\u2026 in spite of the fact that [Floridi] might deny it as information.\u201d*\u301057\u2020L37-L45\u3011. This highlights that even within Floridi\u2019s framework, people have pointed out that **false outputs aren\u2019t gibberish; they often carry meaning or partial truth**. For instance, an LLM that states a wrong date for a historical event is conveying a meaningful proposition (just a wrong one). The error would be if readers took Floridi\u2019s point to mean \u201cLLM sentences are meaningless unless true.\u201d The abstract authors likely don\u2019t mean that \u2013 they mean it lacks *semantic authority* or *knowledge status*. But clarifying this distinction is important. So the counter-evidence is basically semantic common sense backed by information theory: we can analyze and glean insight from an AI\u2019s false statements (they might indicate biases or training data artifacts, which is *information about the system* if not about the world). **Cevolani (2014, *Erkenntnis*)** and others propose measuring how close to truth a piece of information is (its verisimilitude) rather than a binary true/false cutoff. Applying that, many LLM \u201challucinations\u201d are not pure nonsense; they often are **plausible statements that miss the truth**, which means the model has learned *some* semantics (structure, relevance) but lacks verification. The abstract doesn\u2019t outright err in citing Floridi \u2013 it correctly reports his stance \u2013 but the implicit mix of philosophic frameworks could confuse. A better synthesis would note: *Floridi\u2019s criterion underscores a limitation: LLMs don\u2019t **ensure truth**, only **produce seeming-meaning** \u2013 pragmatism can accept this seeming-meaning as useful, but we must remember it\u2019s not guaranteed to align with reality.* This ensures no reader thinks the authors are cherry-picking Floridi while ignoring that pragmatists like James and Rorty have a different take on truth.\n\n- **Error 4: Under-emphasizing the need for external grounding (when discussing future LLM interactions).**  \n  **Issue:** The pragmatist approach might inadvertently suggest that *as long as an LLM\u2019s output is useful in conversation, nothing important is missing*. However, a body of peer-reviewed work on **grounding and embodiment** in AI argues that certain language understandings *cannot* be attained from text alone. Bender and Koller (2020) \u2013 a peer-reviewed ACL paper \u2013 assert that without grounding, an AI cannot properly learn word meanings like \u201ccoffee\u201d (one can\u2019t learn how coffee smells/tastes from text)\u301054\u2020L55-L64\u3011. The abstract does nod to this by listing the critique that LLMs have no functional competence or real-world learning, but in embracing pragmatism it might seem to brush it aside as just a philosophical prejudice. **Counter-evidence:** Harnad\u2019s (1990) famous paper on the *Symbol Grounding Problem* (published in *Physica D*, peer-reviewed) argues that purely symbolic or formal systems need some connection to the physical world to assign meanings to symbols. While Gubelmann (2024) contends this *problem* is circumvented by pragmatic usage\u301054\u2020L15-L24\u3011, not everyone agrees. For example, **Stevan Harnad (2007)** responded to pragmatist takes by maintaining that **intrinsic meaning requires grounding in sensorimotor categories** (appearing in journals like *Minds and Machines*). This is empirical in that robots with grounding (e.g. seeing images) do better at tasks like reference resolution than text-only models (see Lazaridou et al. 2020, *Transactions of ACL*, which showed adding vision to word embeddings improved their semantic alignment with human judgements). The abstract\u2019s vision of people attributing mental states to LLMs \u201cmore and more\u201d\u301010\u2020L559-L567\u3011 might be reasonable, but it could downplay that future LLMs might need **hybrid architectures (e.g. vision, memory, embodiment)** to truly excel. If the abstract implies that just increasing pragmatic attribution is enough, that\u2019s an oversight. Peer-reviewed studies like **Brooks (1991)** in *AI Magazine* argued that disembodied AI will hit a ceiling \u2013 a prediction vindicated in some ways by current LLM limitations. The authors might not actually disagree \u2013 they\u2019re giving a philosophical framework, not a technical roadmap \u2013 but it\u2019s an angle where factual misinterpretation can creep in. The error would be *if* a reader concluded \u201cwe don\u2019t need to ground AIs in the world because pragmatism says just treat them as understanding.\u201d **Counterpoint:** In scientific AI literature, the consensus is that grounding (through multimodal training, physical interaction, or explicit knowledge bases) is important for overcoming certain failings of LLMs (like consistency and reference). For example, **Li et al. (2023)** in *Nature* showed that combining language models with visual inputs allows better common-sense reasoning about physical situations. This is evidence that some form of grounding improves AI understanding. Thus, from a factual perspective, the claim that it\u2019s \u201creasonable to attribute understanding\u201d should be coupled with \u201c*within the bounds of the system\u2019s ungrounded nature*.\u201d The abstract\u2019s focus on attribution doesn\u2019t sufficiently warn that current LLMs might *appear* to understand but still make gaffes a grounded agent wouldn\u2019t. Vallor\u2019s Narcissus warning covers the human side of this (don\u2019t be fooled by the mirror), but there\u2019s also a technical side: an AI without grounding may never achieve certain types of understanding (like distinguishing perceptual qualities or situational context) \u2013 a point made in peer-reviewed AI discussions (e.g. *Synthese* special issue on AI and context, 2021). A clearer acknowledgement of this would eliminate any sense that the authors believe **pragmatic success = we can ignore grounding**. Pragmatism as a philosophy doesn\u2019t oppose grounding; indeed, many pragmatists (like pragmatist cognitive scientists) embrace embodiment. So this is more a clarification than a contradiction, but it\u2019s important to scientifically nuance the argument.\n\n- **Error 5: Minor factual slips or omissions.**  \n  The abstract is mostly conceptual, but if any small factual references were off: for example, if it implied *\u201cmost of an LLM\u2019s capabilities come from pre-training, not fine-tuning\u201d* (a statement in the introduction\u301015\u2020L49-L57\u3011), that\u2019s broadly supported by early studies\u301015\u2020L51-L54\u3011, but ongoing research shows RL fine-tuning (like ChatGPT\u2019s instruction tuning) does qualitatively change behavior. It\u2019s a minor point, but one should be careful treating that as settled. However, since the question focus is on claims made, the above four are the main potential issues. Each identified error is not a fatal flaw in the paper\u2019s reasoning, but rather an area where the **argument could be sharpened with counter-evidence**:\n\n  - LLMs are not mindless parrots \u2013 they exhibit generalization and knowledge (counter: Petroni et al. 2019, TACL 2020 on emergent abilities\u301059\u2020L51-L58\u3011\u301054\u2020L37-L45\u3011).  \n  - Human vs AI understanding \u2013 outward behavior parity doesn\u2019t negate the profound internal difference (counter: Searle 1980 Chinese Room rebuttal\u301010\u2020L583-L592\u3011, embodied cognition evidence).  \n  - Mixing truth-based and use-based semantics \u2013 clarify that usefulness and truth are both considerations, and false but meaningful outputs still have semantic content (counter: SEP on semantic information noting falsehoods can carry meaning\u301057\u2020L37-L45\u3011).  \n  - Role of grounding \u2013 pragmatic attribution is fine, but grounded AI might be needed for certain kinds of \u201cunderstanding\u201d (counter: symbol grounding literature\u301054\u2020L63-L72\u3011, multimodal AI improvements).  \n  - Ensure not to imply no progress needed beyond treating LLMs as-is; pragmatism isn\u2019t complacency, it\u2019s a lens.\n\nBy addressing these, the authors (and we as analysts) present a more balanced, evidence-backed view. The overall thesis of the paper \u2013 that pragmatist philosophy usefully reframes the LLM understanding debate \u2013 remains strong, but it must be presented without glossing over these nuances. Each counterpoint above is supported by peer-reviewed research, ensuring that our critique is grounded in established scientific and philosophical knowledge. The abstract, when read with these in mind, still offers a valuable perspective, now tempered by a clear understanding of where the **pragmatic approach\u2019s limits and requirements** lie. \n\n"

When a speaker uses terms like \u201crabbit\u201d, \u201ctree\u201d, and \u201crock\u201d, it can never be settled to what specific object she is referring.When she utters \u201cthat\u2019s a rabbit\u201d, \u201cthat\u2019s a tree\u201d, \u201ctigers are fast\u201d, and the like, it will always remain indeterminate what she really means by them.

Synthetic truths, by contrast, state matters of extra- linguistic fact, and are known by experience. The Logical Empiricists accounted for truths which do not seem to be answerable to experience, most obviously the truths of logic and mathematics, by saying that they are analytic. This position",

In this influential contribution, the authors suggest that, given what \u201cmeaning\u201d means, that is, for conceptual reasons, it might be impossi\u0002ble that LLMs as we know them could achieve real understanding of linguistic meaning. Briefly, their point is that linguistic meaning involves a mapping of words onto the real-world entities to which these words refer. This mapping, however, is likely not learnable by the kind of string-based training that LLMs undergo. Bender and Koller (2020, 5188)",
