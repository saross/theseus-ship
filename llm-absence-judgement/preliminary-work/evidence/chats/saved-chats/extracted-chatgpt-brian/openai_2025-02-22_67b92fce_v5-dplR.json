            "Hi o1. Today we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper. \n\n# Ground rules\n\nABOVE ALL ELSE, if you are unsure about something, or do not have evidence from a web page supporting a claim, do not make a claim. If there is any doubt, there is no doubt.\n\nThis is research. SPEND EXTRA TIME above and beyond normal, to collect data carefully and methodically. We don't care about how long it takes, only that your research is accurate and epistemologically grounded. Care and attention to detail second only to the prior rule.\n\n# Definitions\n\n## Tool definition\nFor our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software\u2014be it a program, script, or web application\u2014that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets\u2014without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement\u2014are excluded. \n\nIn essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.\n\nIt is our belief that the tools we have given you meet this criteria, however, if there is an absence of evidence supporting our belief, it is REQUIRED that you inform us of any problems. IF YOU ARE UNSURE, INDICATE IT rather than giving an answer.\n\n# Task\n\nI will be giving you the name or acronym of an archaeology and historical studies-related software tool which dates somewhere from 1995 onwards. \n\nYou must build a well-formed quoted CSV inside a fenced code block with the following columns:\ncsv\n\"Tool\", \"Year\", \"Source\", \"URL\", \"AI Notes\"\n\n* Tool is our key column. It is essential to be consistent in tool name, following the input we give you. If there is an issue indicate it in notes.\n* Year, year from the web page, article, or source you found, n.d. is a valid entry for \"no date\"\n* Source: Citation or (Domain + Page Title)\n* URL, url of the resource. \n* AI notes: any notes, concerns, or uncertainties you have with the data provenance or quality. Do not use HTML citations.\n\nThis is a comprehensive and systematic search. For each year, 1995 onwards, we one mention (one line) per source found. Obviously, many of these tools were created after 1995, so we'll want to expand our search by +- 1 year from any date we find. When you find a source, systematically explore adjacent years in your searches.\n\nDO NOT extrapolate dates from sources. ONLY include dates where a source has been published in that year. We will perform all necessary inference, if you include a line for EACH valid source you find. For undated items, indicate \"n.d.\"\n\nThis research requires that you be thoughtful, systematic, and take your time. You will likely need to visit EVERY SINGLE PAGE of search results for a given tool. \n\nTo repeat back.\n\nI'm going to give you a list of tools, one by one.\nYou will search for them.\nFor every source you find,  we want to record year/n.d., source (citation or title), and url\n\nYou MUST build a CSV with the output in your direct response to the deep research process.\n\nAllowed sources: \n* Do try to find it's source code in published version control repos (add a row if they have public code, as the commits will have dates)\n* do try to find scholarly literature (each to one row)\n* do include blog posts and about pages (each to one row)\n* do include any other mentions of the tool (each to one row)\n\nWhen you respond with data:\nRESULTS: Build the CSV of evidence you have found with  ANY mention of that tool in ANY year/n.d. should be on the CSV, regardless of source. Include one line for EACH source you find.\n\nDo you understand?"

You will provide the name or acronym of an archaeology or historical studies-related software tool.\n2. I will conduct an exhaustive search to find mentions of this tool from 1995 onwards, capturing data meticulously.\n3. For each valid source, I will record:\n   - Tool name (as given by you, unchanged)\n   - Year of publication or mention (n.d. if no date available)\n   - Source citation or page title + domain\n   - URL of the resource\n   - AI Notes for any concerns or ambiguities regarding the source or data\n4. I will generate a quoted CSV with a row for every distinct mention of the tool found in each year.\n5. I will prioritize source code repositories, scholarly literature, blogs, about pages, and any other mentions following your hierarchy.\n\nJust to double-check: Would you like me to include archived web pages (e.g., Wayback Machine captures) if they provide evidence from earlier years?"

This approach guarantees each reference is reliable.\n\n**Assessing source validity**\n\nI\u2019m gathering info from CRAN and GitHub to pinpoint the publication year of \"dplR\" and ensuring each reference is distinct. This helps in accurate year and source identification.\n\n**Team alignment**\n\nI\u2019m working through how to efficiently manage a large group: streamline communication, delegate tasks, and use productivity tools to keep everyone on track and motivated.\n\n**Crunching sources**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing references from 2008 and 2010 Dendrochronologia articles, noting DOI links. For unclear dates, \"n.d.\" will be specified in the CSV.\n\n**Spotting distinct mentions**\n\nI\u2019m identifying unique references: the 2008 and 2010 Dendrochronologia articles, CRAN page (potentially undated), and GitHub. Accuracy is ensured by avoiding assumptions.\n\n**Clarifying the timeline**\n\nI\u2019m gathering info on the potential inclusion of a creation date, aiming for precision without making assumptions. Valid official references will be detailed to ensure clarity.\n\n**Sticking to solid references**\n\nI\u2019m honing in on the 2008 and 2010 Bunn articles and the CRAN link. References from rOpenSci or OpenDendro forum are uncertain but may be worth noting.\n\n**Gathering insights**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together details on the GitHub project and the R package \"dplR,\" using \"n.d.\" for unclear dates. These elements seem essential for accurate inclusion.\n\n**Clarifying references**\n\nI\u2019m noting three verified sources: the 2008 and 2010 Bunn articles, and the official CRAN and GitHub pages for the dplR tool. Accuracy is key to refining the list."
