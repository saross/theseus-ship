            "**Objective:**  \nExtract a structured dataset from the Journal of Open Source Software (https://joss.theoj.org/papers/published) that documents every published paper and identifies any explicitly named software tools used for **historical sciences or archaeology research** mentioned in each article. These tools must be discrete pieces of software (programs, scripts, web applications) used by researchers for tasks such as data collection, preparation, analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation. Indirect or generic references are not acceptable.\n\n# Tool definition\nFor our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software\u2014be it a program, script, or web application\u2014that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets\u2014without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement\u2014are excluded. \n\nIn essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.\n\nThis journal has every article about software. We want to highlight only software with applicability to our domain.\n\n**Data to Extract for Each Article:**  \n- **Title:** The title of the article, enclosed in quotes.  \n- **Authors:** The article\u2019s authors, listed in a dedicated column.  \n- **URL:** A direct link to the article.  \n- **Issue Number:** The issue number in which the article appears.  \n- **Year:** The publication year of the article.  \n- **Tools Mentioned:** Explicitly named research software tools used for the relevant research tasks (multiple entries allowed, separated by semicolons).\n\n**Output Format:**  \nThe final dataset should be output as a CSV file inside a code block. The columns must appear in this exact order:\n\n\"Title\"\t\"Authors\"\t\"URL\"\t\"Issue Number\"\t\"Year\"\t\"Tools Mentioned\"\n\n\n**Additional Instructions:**  \n- **No inline citations:** Avoid any extra markers or citation references within the data cells to prevent data corruption.  \n- **Meticulous research:** Take as much time as needed to carefully review each article and verify the accuracy of tool mentions.  \n- **Error Reporting:** If any errors or issues arise during the process, provide a separate error log outlining the encountered problems.  \n- **Iterative Process:** This is a long-term, iterative project, so precision is prioritized over speed.  \n\nJOSS has a cursored list (i.e. https://joss.theoj.org/papers/published?page=2) which runs to page 144. Please work through pages 1-20. Take extreme amounts of extra time and be very careful. If things are borderline within the disciplines we are interested in, ask us."

I'll extract a structured dataset from the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) covering pages 1-20, identifying software tools explicitly used for historical sciences or archaeology research. Since this requires extreme precision, I\u2019ll take extra time to ensure accuracy.\n\nA few clarifications before I begin:\n- **Borderline cases**: If a software tool is used in a discipline that seems loosely related to historical sciences or archaeology, would you like me to flag them for review instead of excluding them outright?\n- **Multidisciplinary software**: Some tools may be designed for broader applications but have archaeology/historical use cases mentioned in the article. Should I include such tools only if the paper explicitly states they were used in historical sciences/archaeology research?\n- **Unclear cases**: Would you like me to provide notes alongside ambiguous tools or research domains for discussion?\n\nOnce I have confirmation, I\u2019ll begin the structured extraction. Let me know how you'd like me to proceed with these nuances!"
