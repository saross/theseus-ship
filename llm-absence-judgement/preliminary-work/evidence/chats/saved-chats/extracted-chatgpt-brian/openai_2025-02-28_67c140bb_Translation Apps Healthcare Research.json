            "Below is a **functional decomposition** of your request, followed by specific **questions** to clarify any ambiguities or confirm details. Once we have your clarifications, we\u2019ll move on to compiling the exhaustive CSV.\n\n---\n\n## **Functional Decomposition**\n\n1. **Overall Goal**  \n   - Collect **all published materials** (policies, laws, court or tribunal cases, official guidelines, reports, academic papers, press articles, etc.) that **directly address** the use of modern AI-driven translation apps (broadly: LLMs, NMT, AI chatbots, etc.) in healthcare contexts for **patient-clinician communication** in **NSW** (and, if relevant, broader Australia).\n\n2. **Focus**  \n   - Must specifically involve the **use of software** (apps, websites, chatbots, or embedded features in telehealth platforms) that provide **translation or interpretation** services (verbal/spoken or written/textual) using **\u201cmodern AI\u201d** or **machine translation**.  \n\n3. **Context & Usage**  \n   - The **healthcare** context can include (but is not limited to) public hospitals, private practices, GPs, aged-care facilities, mental health services, allied health, telehealth, and so on, as long as it is **patient-clinician** communication. \n   - \u201cUse\u201d might refer to formal pilots or trials, official guidance, policies that encourage or discourage use, legal or ethical discussions, actual reported cases (e.g., legal or complaint proceedings), or news reporting on the subject.\n\n4. **Output Format (CSV)**  \n   - **Columns**:  \n     1. **Tool** \u2013 Name or short descriptor of the technology/app/service if known (e.g., Google Translate, iTranslate, custom AI system).  \n     2. **Publication** \u2013 Title of the policy, article, paper, etc.  \n     3. **URL** \u2013 A direct link to the source (if available).  \n     4. **Date (if known)** \u2013 The publication date or last update date.  \n     5. **Use** \u2013 A short note describing how the tool is being used or discussed in that source.  \n   - **Completeness**: If a cell is unknown or data is unavailable, leave it blank or mark it \u201cunknown\u201d (but do not fabricate data).  \n   - **Accuracy**: Must reflect the actual source accurately.  \n\n5. **Scope of Sources**  \n   - **Government websites** (e.g., NSW Health, Australian Department of Health and Aged Care, local health districts).  \n   - **Legislation / Policy** (state or federal) relevant to translation or AI in healthcare.  \n   - **Official guidelines** or position statements from professional bodies (e.g., AMA, RACGP, AHPRA).  \n   - **Academic research** (peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings).  \n   - **News media** or healthcare industry news coverage.  \n   - **Legal cases** (if any) before courts, tribunals, or professional conduct boards referencing usage of AI/machine translation in healthcare.\n\n6. **Exhaustiveness & Detail**  \n   - We want to be **as comprehensive as possible**.  \n   - No speculative or fabricated references. If unsure, indicate it.\n\n---\n\n## **Clarifications / Questions**\n\n1. **Time Range**  \n   - Is there any **timeframe** within which you\u2019d like us to focus (e.g., only from 2015 onward)?  \n   - Or **should we include** all references we find, no matter how far back?\n\n2. **Geographic Scope**  \n   - You mentioned **NSW** \u201cand/or Australia.\u201d  \n   - **Do we include** references from other Australian states if they touch on AI translation in healthcare, or do you strictly want materials that mention NSW specifically?  \n   - If a federal-level policy applies across all states (including NSW), presumably that\u2019s **in scope**, correct?\n\n3. **Types of Translation**  \n   - Do you want references specifically about **spoken** (speech-to-speech) vs. **written** (text translation), or do you want **both** included whenever they appear?  \n   - Should we also include references about sign language interpreting apps or other forms of interpretation, or is your interest **only in spoken/written** languages?\n\n4. **Tools & Technologies**  \n   - Are **general machine translation apps** (e.g., older phrase-based or rule-based) relevant, or do you strictly want **\u201cmodern\u201d** (neural machine translation, LLMs) references?  \n   - **Google Translate** is commonly used. It partially uses neural machine translation. Should references to Google Translate usage in healthcare be included if it\u2019s explicitly mentioned?\n\n5. **Professional vs. Consumer Tools**  \n   - Are you interested in **consumer-oriented apps** (e.g., a clinician using Google Translate on their phone) *and* enterprise-level or in-hospital pilot solutions?  \n   - Or are you more focused on official or endorsed solutions (e.g., something a local health district might have trialed)?\n\n6. **Policy, Ethics, Legal**  \n   - Should we look for references about **ethical** or **policy** debates (e.g., reliability, privacy, patient safety) where an official body or article explicitly mentions AI-based translation for patient interactions?\n\n7. **Legal / Complaint Cases**  \n   - Are you also looking for any **Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC)** cases or tribunal decisions in NSW that mention **machine translation** or AI-based translation?\n\n8. **Academic vs. Grey Literature**  \n   - Should we also look into **grey literature** like conference presentations, discussion papers, or blog posts from recognized healthcare organizations?\n\n9. **Level of Detail**  \n   - Since the CSV must be **accurate**, do you want **direct quotations / summaries** for \u201cUse,\u201d or just a concise note (e.g., \u201cUsed in hospital pilot for multilingual discharge instructions\u201d)?  \n\n10. **Additional Requirements**  \n   - Any other relevant details or constraints you want to place on **data sources** or **format**?\n\n---\n\nOnce you provide clarifications on the questions above (or confirm any that you already know the answers to), I will:\n\n1. Begin systematically **identifying and collecting** all relevant sources.  \n2. Verify their **authenticity** and **applicability** to ensure nothing is fabricated.  \n3. Format them into a **CSV** table with your required headers.  \n\n**Please let me know your preferences regarding the above points, and then we\u2019ll proceed!**"
