            "Canvas I'm going to input some ... adequate... transcripts and context.\n\nMy objective for you is to go through these transcripts and clean them up. Ask me questions about what I meant when things are unclear.\n\nTo begin, here's context\n\n<context1>\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\n\\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}\n\\usepackage{parskip}\n\n\\title{An Absence of Judgment: On AI's Fundamental Limitations in Research}\n\\author{}\n\\date{}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nLarge language models are fundamentally incapable of judgment, despite their ability to mimic the language of judgment. This distinction necessitates examining not only their linguistic output but also the concrete actions and outcomes that their words produce. However, this lack merely prevents us from treating them as true agents, \\textit{not} as extracting mundane utility from them as tools. This paper is an investigation into the creation of a research-grade dataset using OpenAI's Deep Research in February 2025, acting as a case study --- and our ``autoethnographic'' reflection upon the use of this tool for what Zvi Moshowitz calls ``mundane utility.\"\n\nHere, we will also give our understanding of the necessary prerequsities for an ``agentic'' tool, and why we believe that this infrastructure, at this time, does not satisfy that criteria. We will also discuss the fundamental lack of judgement that these models exhibit, and why it is this core incapability which prevents an accumulation of patterns-shaped-like-knowledge to answer Dwarkesh's question to Cohen: ``what do you make of the fact that these things have basically the entire corpus of human knowledge memorized and they haven\u2019t been able to make a single new connection that has led to a discovery? Whereas if even a moderately intelligent person had this much stuff memorized, they would notice \u2014 Oh, this thing causes this symptom.'' We assert that the lack of induction exhibited by even currently accessible frontier models like o3-mini-high, answers this question. To be clear, this paper is a description of what we have experienced in our attempt to actively use these models to research and answer an academic question --- not merely to conduct a \\textit{descriptive} literature review, but to find that central spark of insight which represents a contribution to the literature. We do not say that these capabilities are forever barred to these models, merely that they do not exhibit them yet and that the common errors in estimating the capabilities of these models based on \\textit{what they say} rather than \\textit{how they act} can lead to confusion as to their actual capabilities and hinder finding places of mundane utility in our use of these tools. \n\n\n\\section{Agentic Systems}\n\n#  \"Agentic\" Systems vs Normal Software\n\n## Goal-Related Characteristics\n1. Goal Following vs Goal Setting\n   - Agentic systems are goal-following systems\n   - This contrasts with AGI, which can set its own goals\n   - Key distinction: Agentic systems require external input for goals\n\n## Agentic Characteristics\n1. Goal Processing Capabilities\n   - Accept external goals as input\n   - Collaborate with users to operationalize goals\n   - Functionally decompose goals into manageable components\n\n2. Execution Capabilities\n   - Create plans for goal completion\n   - Invoke appropriate software and APIs\n   - Monitor and assess progress\n\n3. Assessment and Reporting\n   - Make judgments about goal completion\n   - Provide reports to users (like Claude)\n   - Include success/failure evaluation based on system's judgment\n\n\\section{Deep Research and AI Capabilities}\n\n\\subsection{Current State}\nThe implementation of O3 for research purposes, while advanced, reveals fundamental limitations. This connects to broader discussions, as highlighted in Cohen's repost of DAKISH regarding AI's inability to produce truly groundbreaking research. While these systems demonstrate acceptable fluency and solid domain knowledge, they lack crucial elements of genuine research capability.\n\n% One question I had for you while we were talking about the intelligence stuff was, as a scientist yourself, what do you make of the fact that these things have basically the entire corpus of human knowledge memorized and they haven\u2019t been able to make a single new connection that has led to a discovery? Whereas if even a moderately intelligent person had this much stuff memorized, they would notice \u2014 Oh, this thing causes this symptom. This other thing also causes this symptom. There\u2019s a medical cure right here.\n\n% Shouldn\u2019t we be expecting that kind of stuff?\n\n% It\u2019s a very good question. In 2023, I quipped, \u201cI think they have, we just haven\u2019t asked them.\u201d Maybe, but less clear today. Dwarkesh reports that there have been no good answers.\n% https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/912665402/0/marginalrevolution~Dwarkeshs-Question.html\n\n\n\\subsection{Fundamental Limitations}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Absence of goal-setting and goal-following behavior\n    \\item Constraint to the Next Token paradigm\n    \\item Limited self-reflexivity, characterized by:\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item Simple search execution\n            \\item Information synthesis without true comprehension\n        \\end{itemize}\n    \\item Inability to genuinely evaluate goal accomplishment\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item System assumes task completion at each output\n            \\item Lacks true self-assessment capability\n        \\end{itemize}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Comparative Analysis}\nUsing a first-week PhD student as our prototypical target, we observe that while AI systems can mimic goal-following behavior, they fundamentally lack the authentic research capabilities demonstrated by even novice human researchers.\n\n\\section{Other infrastructures}\n\n\\subsection{Anthropic Computer Use}\n\nWhile this is promising as a rough paradigm, Claude 3.5 Sonnet 20241022 did not possess sufficient world-intuition to collect a series of 8 article links from a web page. This failure consumed \\$1 of tokens, which is to say, 1.2 million tokens (mostly in screenshots) of failure to click, failure to right click, failure to change apps between firefox and libreoffice, and wittering about trying to solve its own navigation problems. \n\nHowever, this does not require a difference in kind, merely a degree. This paradigm of computer use is a future of computer augmented research, since it got the idea of what we wanted to do. It simply failed at execution due to a deductive deficiency. The first chat was lost due to an inadvertent window closure (and the fact that absolutely no logs are kept by this demo application). The second one is in our supplemental data.) While we are sure that some prompt improvements can be made, as this was our second attempt at using computer use, further iteration would not reward the effort.\n\nNo prompting has been shared for Computer Use, as we were not able to proceed beyond our initial proof of concept. It is clear that with sufficient budget, and human supervision, Computer Use would be able to gradually navigate around web pages and extract data. It is simply not an efficient use of time or money at this stage of Claude 3.5 Sonnet's capabilities. \n\n\\subsection{Elicit Research Paper}\n\nFor Elicit, we provided the following prompt:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\nResearch question: Within the literature of archaeology and the historical sciences, constructed broadly, what software tools exist as discussed in the literature from 1995 onwards? Specifically, we are looking for you to examine the journals of: Internet Archaeology, SoftwareX, JOAD, JOSS, JCAA, and STAR (Science \\& Tech of Archaeological Research). We define a tool as: ```For our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software\u2014be it a program, script, or web application\u2014that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets\u2014without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement\u2014are excluded. In essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.``` The objective of this research report is to find and cite EVERY SINGLE software tool (from our construction above) as mentioned in those journals SO LONG as those software tools have specific and direct applicability or citation within papers about archaeological and historical sciences. Some of those journals are discipline specific, and we need to look through for software tool mentions (mere published datasets are not interesting to us). Some of those journals are tool specific, and we need to look through for DISCIPLINE mentions, to ensure that the tool has specific and direct relevance to historians and archaeologists. My objective here is either a bulleted list of citations, or if you can manage it a csv of citations for further work. The intention is that this research will support a paper on software longevity.\n\n\\end{quote}\n\nWe did not believe that it would accomplish any real proportion of the prompt, but given that the Elicit team provided us a coupon for the \"Plus\" plan (\\$12/month), the available capabilities afforded to us were a one-prompt-and-go text area. Elicit's own infrastructure evaluated this prompt as a \"Great question.\" Unlike with our assessment of Anthropic's Computer Use, we believe that changes in both kind and degree are necessary for Elicit to be useful for research data collection. We assert the following systematic issues.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Unacceptable scope, inhereted from Semantic Scholar\n    \\item Problematic search criteria, via Semantic Scholar's deplorable TLDR summaries    \n    \\item Model judgement failures in screening criteria operationalisation and evaluation\n    \\item An utter lack of judgement and discernment in the final research report\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nWe did find that, from our prompt, the model they are using did create acceptable screening criteria, but once created, the evaluation of those criteria against sample papers was deeply unsatisfactory. \n\n\\subsection{Perplexity Deep Research}\n\n\\subsection{Google Deep Research}\n\n\\section{Practical Applications}\n\n\\subsection{Literature Reviews}\nInitial applications in literature review processes have shown promising results, particularly in:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Dataset preparation and collection for research purposes\n    \\item Improvement over previous superficial review methodologies\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Future Development}\n\\subsection{Areas Requiring Further Investigation}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The Normal Intuitive Pattern concept requires elaboration\n    \\item Connection between mundane utility and tool-using behavior\n    \\item Precise definition of agentic behavior in research contexts\n    \\item Concrete manifestations of judgment absence in research outputs\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\end{document}\n</context1>\n\n<context2>\n# An Absence of Judgment: On AI's Fundamental Limitations in Research\n\n## 1.

Could you briefly confirm how you'd like these terms specifically defined or described? They appear central but are not yet explicitly defined in the provided transcript or context.\n\n2. **Abbreviations and References**:  \n   - The term **O3** appears several times. I interpreted it as referring specifically to a model or software called \"o3-mini-high.\" Is that correct?\n   - **DAKISH** and **Dwarkesh's question** are referenced. Do you prefer these remain as named references, or would you prefer them expanded, explained, or footnoted in the cleaned transcript?\n\n3. **Crosstalk or Possible Microphone Issues**:  \n   - I noticed occasional unclear segments that seem like microphone noise or crosstalk. Do you want me to clearly mark these instances with \"[unclear]\" or simply remove them entirely if they do not affect meaning?\n\nPlease clarify these points, and I'll proceed with cleaning up the first transcript accordingly."

Introduction\\n- Fundamental incapability of judgment in LLMs despite linguistic mimicry (00:01:32)\\n- Case study: OpenAI's Deep Research (February 2025) (00:03:15)\\n- Dwarkesh's question regarding AI and discovery (00:08:04)\\n\\n## 2. Agentic Systems\\n### Goal-Related Characteristics\\n- Goal-following vs goal-setting\\n  - AGI sets own goals, current models follow externally provided goals (00:09:45)\\n\\n### Agentic Characteristics\\n- Goal processing capabilities (00:11:20)\\n  - Operationalizing goals\\n- Execution capabilities (00:11:50)\\n  - Planning and API/software interaction\\n- Assessment and reporting (00:13:10)\\n  - Claude as an example of success/failure judgment\\n\\n## 2. Deep Research Analysis\\n### Current State\\n- Advanced fluency, limited genuine research capability (00:16:05)\\n- Example failure: Newspaper article generation (00:17:50)\\n\\n### Fundamental Limitations\\n- Absence of goal-setting behavior (00:18:30)\\n- Constraint to Next Token paradigm\\n- Limited self-reflexivity (00:20:15)\\n  - Superficial synthesis, lack of comprehension\\n- Inability to evaluate goal accomplishment (00:22:40)\\n\\n### Comparative Analysis\\n- AI vs first-week PhD student (00:24:55)\\n  - Superficial imitation vs authentic research skills\\n\\n## 2. Epistemic Limitations (Epistemic \u2013 Monday at 8:50 am)\\n### Understanding vs Mimicry\\n- Mimicking understanding without genuine insight\\n- Problematic reliance on memorization rather than induction\\n\\n### Dwarkesh's Question\\n- Inability of LLMs to produce new connections despite extensive memorization\\n- Human inductive reasoning vs LLM limitations\\n- Implications for practical research tasks\\n\\n## 3. Agentic Systems\\n### Goal-Related Characteristics\\n- Clarified differences between AGI and current systems\\n\\n### Execution and Limitations\\n- Current practical examples of limitations (e.g., navigation failure in Claude)\\n- Cost implications of execution failures\\n\\n## 4. Practical Applications\\n### Effective Use Cases\\n- Dataset preparation and literature review enhancement\\n- Mundane utility: defining practical applications clearly\\n\\n### Workflow Integration\\n- Identifying optimal points for human intervention\\n- Balancing AI capability with human oversight\\n\\n## 4. Future Development\\n### Areas Requiring Further Investigation\\n- The Normal Intuitive Pattern concept\\n- Mundane utility and tool-using behavior\\n- Precise definition of agentic behavior\\n- Manifestations of judgment absence in research\\n\\n### To-Do Items\\n- Clarify definition of \\\"identic\\\" with Brett (00:34:00)\\n- Further elaboration on concrete manifestations of judgment absence\"}]}"
