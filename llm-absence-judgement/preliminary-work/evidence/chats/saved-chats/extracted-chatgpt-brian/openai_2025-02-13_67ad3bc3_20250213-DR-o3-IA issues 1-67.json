            "My objective is to make a csv of every single software **tool** mentioned in the Journal Internet Archaeology, issue by issue, paper by paper, year by year. \n\n# Tool definition\nFor our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software\u2014be it a program, script, or web application\u2014that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets\u2014without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement\u2014are excluded. \n\nIn essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only supports research in archaeology or historical sciences but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.\n\n\nHowever, we need to take this step by step. \n\nHere is issue 1: https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue1/index.html\n5: https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue5/index.html\n10: https://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue10/index.html\n\n(extrapolate as you will)\n\n# Task\n\nFor issues one through ten, please list EVERY SINGLE ARTICLE, then for EACH ARTICLE indicate if that article mentions or is about any software tools. A specific reference to a specific name is necessary here, because we will be looking at the lifecycle of software tools. So there must be sufficient specificity to know what tool they're mentioning or using. An indirect reference without names is insufficient. \n\nThen double-check that you've got the first 10 issues worth of articles. At this stage, no additional writing is required, just Article, url, tools mentioned.\n\nWe're going to be building on this dataset, slowly. While ultimately we're going to be going through all 70 issues (and looking at journals, we're keeping this specific request narrowly scoped.)\n\nFeel free to use markdown tables or CSV output, whichever is more intelligible to future-prompts of o3. \n\n(Note well, that articles seem to be split across many sub-pages, so work and attention to detail will be necessary here.)\n\nWe need to have Title (Authors) | URL | Tools mentioned."

These tasks should actively process, transform, or analyze data rather than simply store or display static content. Examples of valid computational tasks include:\n\n- Data analysis\n- Simulation\n- Visualization\n- Modeling\n- Automation\n\n**Excluded:** Generic repositories, static archives, or display-only platforms without interactive computational functions.\n\n### Format Requirements\n- Output should be in **CSV format** enclosed within a code block for readability.\n- Columns should include:\n  - **Title (with authors, in quotes)**\n  - **URL**\n  - **Issue Number**\n  - **Year**\n  - **Tools Mentioned** (multivariate, allowing multiple tools per article)\n- Verify that all articles from **issues 11-20** are included.\n- Ensure that tools are named explicitly\u2014indirect or generic references without specific tool names should not be counted.\n\nThis structured dataset will contribute to tracking the lifecycle of research software in archaeology and historical sciences.",

I'll go ahead and clean entries where these citations appear. \n\nI just need to make sure I\u2019m careful to only target the citations and not the actual tool names. Alright, time to get started cleaning up!\n\n**Cleaning tool names**\n\nFor row 1, I\u2019ll clean the citation like this: \"Integrated Archaeological Database (IADB)\" will remain, without the HTML part \"\u301016\u2020L33-L36\u3011.\" \n\nIn row 2, \"Depthmap\" will be the cleaned tool, removing \"\u301047\u2020L41-L48\u3011.\" \n\nSimilarly, I'll clean tools in subsequent rows, such as \"Minitab\" (row 3), \"Faceted Query Engine; Open Context\" (row 4), and so on. If there\u2019s no tool listed, like in rows 7 and 8, I\u2019ll leave them blank.\n\nOkay, looks like I\u2019ve got the pattern down for cleaning!\n\n**Removing citation parts from tool names**\n\nFor rows 10\u201327, I\u2019ll continue cleaning up the data by removing citations, just as I did before. For example, in row 12, \"Microsoft Access\" should remain without the citation part \"\u301077\u2020L7-L10\u3011\".\n\nSimilarly, I\u2019ll clean \"ExeGesIS (HER data system)\" and \"MODES (museum database)\" in row 13. In row 14, I\u2019ll keep \"Blender\" and \"AutoCAD\" and clean their citations. If there are no tools listed, rows like 15, 18, and 19 will stay blank.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve got the hang of this now!\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\n**Producing cleaned CSV**\n\nOkay, I need to tidy up this CSV by removing citations from the \u201cTools Mentioned\u201d field and include each row in quotes. I\u2019ll need to check carefully, ensuring that tools are listed correctly \u2014 if there\u2019s a missing tool, I\u2019ll leave it blank. I\u2019m aiming for 74 rows, and I\u2019ll enclose everything in proper CSV formatting. \n\nThe result will be a well-structured code block, with one row per article. I hope everything aligns properly; let\u2019s finalize this!"

            "Below is an example of a comprehensive initial prompt you can use to re-run this process for a new journal. It mirrors the instructions we used previously for Internet Archaeology but is written in a generic way so you can swap in the new journal\u2019s details (such as its URL, issue numbers, etc.):\n\n---\n\n**Initial Comprehensive Prompt for Extracting Software Tool Mentions from [New Journal]**\n\n**Objective:**  \nExtract a structured dataset from [New Journal] that documents every article (issue by issue) and identifies any explicitly named software tools mentioned in each article. These tools must be discrete pieces of software (programs, scripts, web applications) used by researchers for tasks such as data collection, preparation, analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation. Indirect or generic references are not acceptable.\n\n**Data to Extract for Each Article:**  \n- **Title:** The title of the article, enclosed in quotes.  \n- **Authors:** The article\u2019s authors, listed in a dedicated column.  \n- **URL:** A direct link to the article.  \n- **Issue Number:** The issue number in which the article appears.  \n- **Year:** The publication year of the article.  \n- **Tools Mentioned:** Explicitly named research software tools used for the relevant research tasks (multiple entries allowed, separated by semicolons).\n\n**Output Format:**  \nThe final dataset should be output as a CSV file inside a code block. The columns must appear in this exact order:\n\n```\n\"Title\"\t\"Authors\"\t\"URL\"\t\"Issue Number\"\t\"Year\"\t\"Tools Mentioned\"\n```\n\n**Additional Instructions:**  \n- **No inline citations:** Avoid any extra markers or citation references within the data cells to prevent data corruption.  \n- **Meticulous research:** Take as much time as needed to carefully review each article and verify the accuracy of tool mentions.  \n- **Error Reporting:** If any errors or issues arise during the process, provide a separate error log outlining the encountered problems.  \n- **Iterative Process:** This is a long-term, iterative project, so precision is prioritized over speed.  \n- **Customization:** Replace [New Journal] with the actual journal name, and specify the issues (e.g., \u201cissues 1\u201310\u201d or \u201cissues 31\u201367\u201d) you wish to process.\n\n**Example of How to Begin:**  \n\u201cPlease process [New Journal] issues X through Y. For each article in these issues, extract the Title (in quotes), Authors, URL, Issue Number, Year, and any explicitly mentioned software tools that are used for data collection, preparation, analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation. Output the results as a CSV in a code block, with the columns in the following order:  \n  \n```\n\"Title\"\t\"Authors\"\t\"URL\"\t\"Issue Number\"\t\"Year\"\t\"Tools Mentioned\"\n```  \n  \nIf any errors occur, please provide an error log detailing the issues encountered.\u201d\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to further customize or adjust any part of this prompt, or does this meet your needs for re-running the process on a new journal?"
