            "Here is something I gave to OpenAI's deep research, plus its questions. \n\nI would like you to do a better job. Be specific, intentional, conscientious, meticulous, and triple-check your claims. Take extra extra extra time. Engage in proleptic reasoning and look for evidence against your claims before making them.\n\n```\n## Primary Research Directive\n\nConduct a thorough and exhaustive search of all academic, institutional, and high-quality sources on Digital Humanities (DH) as of 2025. Create an annotated bibliography organized by source type to support an update of a SWOT analysis. Do not create the SWOT itself, but provide comprehensive source material that would enable such an update.\n\n## Functional Decomposition of Research Areas\n\n### 1. Conceptual Evolution of Digital Humanities\n- How is \"Digital Humanities\" defined and operationalized across different institutions globally in 2025?\n- Identify significant shifts in how DH has been conceptualized since 2020-2023\n- Document how leading DH centers and departments frame their mission and scope\n- Analyze whether the field has become more coherent or remains fragmented in its definition\n\n### 2. Current Academic Landscape\n- Catalog and describe active DH centers, departments, and labs at major universities worldwide\n- Document undergraduate and graduate programs specifically focused on DH\n- Identify trends in program creation, continuation, or discontinuation since 2020\n- Compare curriculum structures and focus areas across different institutions\n\n### 3. Relationship with Generative AI\n- Research how DH has integrated or responded to generative AI technologies\n- Document any emergence of \"DH 2.0\" frameworks incorporating AI\n- Analyze how DH centers are researching, teaching, or utilizing generative AI\n- Identify scholarly work examining the intersection of DH methodologies and generative AI\n\n### 4. Infrastructure and Resource Models\n- Identify successful models for DH infrastructure support at universities\n- Document funding structures for sustainable DH initiatives\n- Research technical requirements and platforms commonly used in current DH practice\n- Compare resource allocation strategies across different institutional contexts\n\n### 5. Employment and Skills Relevance\n- Research current job market demand for DH-related skills\n- Identify which specific DH competencies are valued by employers\n- Document career outcomes for DH program graduates\n- Analyze how industry perceptions of DH qualifications have evolved\n\n### 6. Pedagogical Approaches\n- Document innovative teaching methods in DH education\n- Research assessment strategies that effectively incorporate digital tools\n- Identify successful approaches to teaching technical skills to humanities students\n- Compare student engagement and outcomes across different pedagogical models\n\n### 7. Regional Developments\n- Provide detailed analysis of the state of DH in Australia in 2025\n- Compare with developments in North America, Europe, and Asia\n- Identify regions experiencing growth vs. decline in DH initiatives\n- Document international collaborations and knowledge exchanges\n\n### 8. Future Trajectories\n- Identify emerging technologies or methodologies being incorporated into DH\n- Document scholarly predictions about the future evolution of the field\n- Research strategic planning documents from major DH centers\n- Analyze funding trends and priorities from major grant organizations\n\n## Source Requirements\n\n1. **Academic Publications**: \n   - Peer-reviewed journal articles from 2023-2025\n   - Conference proceedings from major DH conferences (DH2023-2025)\n   - Published books and edited collections on DH topics\n\n2. **Institutional Sources**:\n   - University websites, particularly DH centers and departments\n   - Strategic plans and mission statements\n   - Program descriptions and curriculum documentation\n   - Annual reports from DH initiatives\n\n3. **Professional Organizations**:\n   - Publications and reports from ADHO, aaDH, and similar organizations\n   - Job postings and career guidance materials\n   - Professional development resources\n\n4. **Industry Perspectives**:\n   - Reports on skills demand from relevant industries\n   - Case studies of DH applications in non-academic contexts\n   - Partnership initiatives between universities and external organizations\n\n5. **Government and Funding Bodies**:\n   - Policy documents related to digital research and education\n   - Grant priorities and funded project descriptions\n   - National strategies regarding digital skills and humanities research\n\n## Annotation Requirements\n\nFor each source, provide:\n1. Complete citation in Chicago style\n2. Brief summary of key findings or arguments (100-150 words)\n3. Explicit relevance to SWOT categories (which strength, weakness, opportunity, or threat does this inform?)\n4. Assessment of the source's reliability and potential limitations\n5. Cross-references to other sources that confirm, challenge, or extend its findings\n\n## Output Format\n\nOrganize the annotated bibliography by source type and then chronologically within each type. Include:\n1. Executive summary highlighting the most significant findings (500-750 words)\n2. Thematic clusters that emerged across multiple sources\n3. Identification of knowledge gaps where further research is needed\n4. Full annotated bibliography as described above\n5. Index of institutions and their current DH initiatives\n\nChatGPT said:\nThis is a highly detailed and comprehensive research directive. Before proceeding, could you clarify:\n\nScope of Sources: Should I prioritize open-access sources, or can I include subscription-based journal articles?\n\nRegional Focus: Should I emphasize any specific geographic regions beyond Australia, North America, Europe, and Asia?\n\nPreferred Citation Style: You requested Chicago style, but would you like it in footnote format or author-date style?\n\nTimeframe for Completion: Do you have a deadline for when you need this research completed?\n\nPreferred Output Format: Would you like this delivered as a structured report document, or should I format it for easy integration into an existing document?\n\nLet me know so I can tailor the research accordingly!\n\nYou said:\n1. Everything you have access to. 2. AU first, but UK and north america, and europe all have their own understandings. We want to have a discussion of how each region understands the term\n3. Author date\n4. Be exhaustive, take extra time, double check your claims.\n5. I'll be sending this to someone.\n```"

            "# Executive Summary\n\nDigital Humanities (DH) in 2025 is a dynamic, globally networked field undergoing significant shifts since 2020. **Conceptually,** DH has broadened its scope and self-reflection. Recent scholarship integrates critical theory and questions of power, ensuring that definitions of DH increasingly encompass issues of race, gender, postcolonial perspectives, and ethics\u301023\u2020L163-L172\u3011\u301023\u2020L177-L184\u3011. This introspective turn has enriched DH\u2019s understanding of what it is \u2013 and is not \u2013 as practitioners critique earlier technocentric approaches and champion more inclusive, human-centered methodologies. The result is a field that balances **technological innovation with humanistic critique**, as seen in the dual focus on both new tools and ethical/cultural implications in contemporary DH discourse\u301012\u2020L28-L36\u3011. Notably, **regional perspectives differ:** in North America and Europe, DH is often defined by established centers and infrastructure, whereas in Australia a recent surge of investment (e.g. a record A$25 million national platform) is transforming a once-fragmented landscape into a coordinated national effort\u301030\u2020L513-L520\u3011\u301060\u2020L84-L92\u3011. In Asia, DH is gaining momentum through large conferences and international collaborations, albeit with ongoing challenges in local infrastructure and training\u301026\u2020L155-L163\u3011\u301057\u2020L26-L34\u3011. Across all regions, **interdisciplinary collaboration** has become a watchword for the future \u2013 exemplified by the ADHO 2023 conference theme \u201cCollaboration as Opportunity\u201d and calls for teamwork with data science and other fields\u301026\u2020L155-L163\u3011.\n\nThe **academic landscape** of DH in 2025 is characterized by a mix of thriving and evolving centers, programs, and consortia worldwide. Major universities in North America, Europe, and increasingly the Asia-Pacific host dedicated DH labs or institutes, often embedded in libraries or humanities faculties. However, sustainability is a concern: some early DH centers have faced funding cuts or closure in recent years, especially in environments where humanities budgets are under strain. Conversely, new centers continue to emerge, often oriented toward specific domains (e.g. digital cultural heritage, text analytics, or visualization). A clear trend is the integration of DH into broader digital scholarship or data science initiatives, which can **strengthen resources but blur the identity of standalone DH programs**. Active networks like centerNet and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) facilitate international exchange, and regional organizations (ACH in North America, EADH in Europe, aaDH in Australasia, JADH in Japan, etc.) nurture local communities. **Australia\u2019s academic DH** has been energized by the HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons, linking universities and cultural institutions to share data and tools nationally\u301060\u2020L98-L107\u3011\u301060\u2020L110-L118\u3011. **European DH** benefits from EU-funded infrastructures like DARIAH, enabling cross-country collaboration and standardized tool development. **Asian DH** is growing via partnerships (e.g. Oxford\u2019s fellowship program for Asia-Pacific scholars\u301062\u2020L133-L141\u3011) and large-scale digital projects in China, Japan, and beyond, though uneven resourcing means some scholars still \u201clearn by doing\u201d in low-support environments\u301057\u2020L26-L34\u3011. These developments reflect both **strengths (expanding networks, new funding)** and **weaknesses (precarious funding, regional disparities)** in the DH academic ecosystem.\n\nA transformative theme since 2020 is the **integration of generative AI** into humanities research and teaching. The advent of powerful large language models like ChatGPT has created new opportunities and challenges. On one hand, generative AI is **expanding access to computational methods**, allowing even non-programmers to process and analyze data through natural language prompts\u301065\u2020L34-L42\u3011. Case studies in DH pedagogy demonstrate that tools like ChatGPT, when coupled with *prompt engineering*, can help students and researchers generate insights from art, text, and historical data that were previously out of reach, opening novel avenues for inquiry\u301065\u2020L34-L42\u3011\u301065\u2020L38-L46\u3011. On the other hand, the DH community is critically examining AI\u2019s limitations and ethical pitfalls. National funding bodies have responded: for example, the U.S. NEH launched a \u201cHumanities Perspectives on AI\u201d initiative in 2023 to support research into AI\u2019s societal impacts on truth, trust, and democracy\u301055\u2020L53-L61\u3011. Across regions, DH scholars emphasize the importance of **human oversight, ethical frameworks, and transparency** in AI-assisted research \u2013 aligning with the humanities\u2019 role in making us \u201cmasters of our technology and not its unthinking servants\u201d\u301055\u2020L53-L61\u3011. Generative AI is thus seen as both an *opportunity* (to enhance research capabilities and innovate methods) and a *threat* (if its use outpaces ethical understanding or if it undermines traditional interpretive skills). The prevailing strategy is to integrate AI thoughtfully: training scholars in critical AI literacy, documenting new workflows for reproducibility\u30104\u2020L15-L24\u3011\u30104\u2020L25-L33\u3011, and using AI as a prompt for interdisciplinary collaboration (e.g. computer scientists and humanists working together on AI ethics).\n\n**Infrastructure, funding, and technical support models** for DH have matured significantly, though unevenly, since 2020. In Europe, long-term investments via DARIAH and national programs have yielded robust platforms (data repositories, tools marketplace, etc.) and sustained communities of practice. In North America, philanthropic organizations (Mellon, ACLS) and federal agencies (NEH, IMLS) have continued to fund digital scholarship, with a notable shift toward projects emphasizing social justice, open access, and public engagement\u301035\u2020L157-L165\u3011. However, funding streams are evolving: traditional DH grant lines are being restructured (the NEH\u2019s long-running DH Advancement Grants were recently suspended, reallocating resources to new initiatives), which introduces uncertainty. **Australia\u2019s landmark funding in 2023** marks a turning point for its DH infrastructure \u2013 after years of advocacy, the government\u2019s NCRIS program granted unprecedented resources to humanities e-research, establishing platforms for languages, text analytics, and Indigenous data that promise to **reduce fragmentation and boost technical support**\u301030\u2020L513-L520\u3011\u301060\u2020L98-L107\u3011. This investment addresses prior weaknesses (scattered data, lack of tools) by providing secure storage, national coordination, and training, thereby enabling Australian humanists to fully exploit rich cultural collections\u301060\u2020L101-L109\u3011\u301060\u2020L110-L118\u3011. In Asia, infrastructure development is more nascent; yet, cross-border collaborations (such as the Harvard-Fairbank \u201cTools of the Trade\u201d conference and the Gale-Bodleian fellowships) are seeding progress by sharing tools and expertise\u301026\u2020L155-L163\u3011\u301062\u2020L133-L141\u3011. **Institutional support models** are also adapting: many university libraries now host DH centers or \u201cdigital scholarship\u201d labs, which provide technical expertise and project support while integrating DH into the scholarly information ecosystem. This model ensures some stability (embedding DH in core infrastructure) but can also mean **DH must compete with other library priorities** for resources. Overall, funding and infrastructure are trending toward larger, collective models \u2013 a **strength** in pooling resources and ensuring longevity, yet the need for continuous funding remains a **threat**, as any economic downturn or shift in priorities can directly impact DH support.\n\nThe **employment relevance and job market** for DH-trained scholars is a nuanced picture. The broader humanities job crisis (declining faculty positions and shrinking enrollments) forms the backdrop\u301046\u2020L98-L106\u3011. In academia, DH skills have become highly valued in an increasingly tight market \u2013 many faculty job ads now list digital scholarship expertise as a desirable qualification. This can be seen as a **strategic advantage (Strength)** for DH scholars, as they bring sought-after technical and project management skills. Outside academia, DH graduates are finding roles in libraries, archives, museums, cultural heritage institutions, and the tech industry, leveraging their ability to bridge humanistic inquiry and data analysis. Indeed, **proponents argue that DH cultivates \u201c21st-century skills\u201d** \u2013 from data literacy to collaborative project experience \u2013 which enhance career readiness across sectors\u301050\u2020L23-L30\u3011. For example, incorporating project-based DH assignments in university courses has been shown to instill not only technical competencies but also critical thinking, communication, and leadership aptitudes, aligning humanities training with modern workplace demands\u301050\u2020L23-L30\u3011\u301050\u2020L31-L39\u3011. Nevertheless, structural weaknesses persist. As recent U.S. surveys show, the proportion of humanities PhDs finding secure academic employment has hit historic lows (only ~47% had a job at graduation in 2020)\u301046\u2020L98-L106\u3011. DH alone cannot counteract this systemic issue; in some cases, highly skilled DH practitioners still struggle to find permanent roles, especially if institutions treat DH as a luxury or if their profile doesn\u2019t fit traditional departmental lines. There are also **threats**: the rise of automated tools (including AI) could potentially undercut certain DH-related jobs (for instance, if basic text analysis can be done by generalist staff using AI, a specialist role might be harder to justify). However, such tools also create new needs for **human oversight, curation, and interpretation**, roles well-suited to DH experts. The field is responding by reframing DH skill sets as broadly \u201cdigital liberal arts\u201d competencies valuable in many career paths, and by pushing graduate programs to prepare students for diverse professions (often called the \u201calt-ac\u201d or alternative academic track)\u301044\u2020L163-L172\u3011\u301044\u2020L179-L187\u3011. In summary, while the academic job market remains challenging (a **weakness** and external **threat** to DH\u2019s growth), DH training provides **opportunities** by equipping scholars with versatility and by opening doors beyond the ivory tower \u2013 a point underscored by industry collaborations like Gale\u2019s, which highlight how DH expertise can translate to roles in publishing and tech companies\u301049\u2020L75-L83\u3011\u301050\u2020L25-L33\u3011.\n\n**Pedagogical innovation** in DH has accelerated, particularly in response to the pandemic and the pivot to digital learning. Educators are increasingly integrating DH methods into curricula to engage students with hands-on, interdisciplinary projects. New pedagogical models emphasize experiential learning \u2013 students might build a digital archive, create a text-mining script, or map historical data, thereby learning by doing. This aligns with findings that **project-based learning in DH** fosters both technical acumen and deeper inquiry\u301050\u2020L21-L29\u3011\u301050\u2020L31-L39\u3011. A systematic literature review of DH pedagogy (2012\u20132022) shows that higher education has seen a proliferation of such approaches, though it also flags gaps: DH is still rarely incorporated at the K-12 level, and many programs focus on tool use without sufficient critical reflection on those tools and digital practices\u301042\u2020L73-L81\u3011. The latter is a notable limitation \u2013 the **lack of critical analysis in some DH coursework** could impede students\u2019 ability to interrogate digital sources and methods (a potential *weakness* if graduates have technical skills but not critical digital literacy). To address this, leading programs and recent handbooks stress *critical digital humanities* pedagogy: teaching students not just how to do a computational analysis, but also to ask who built the tool, what biases it carries, and how digital outputs shape knowledge. Assessment methods are also evolving. Traditional essays are complemented or replaced by digital projects, and instructors have developed rubrics for multimodal work (assessing everything from data curation to design and interpretation). This diversification of assessment is seen as an **opportunity** to evaluate a broader range of student skills, though aligning new project outcomes with academic credit frameworks is an ongoing challenge. Another pedagogical advance is the inclusion of **generative AI in teaching**, as highlighted by experiments in using ChatGPT in coursework\u301065\u2020L34-L42\u3011. Rather than viewing AI as a shortcut for cheating, some DH instructors treat it as a learning tool \u2013 for instance, having students critique AI-generated text or use AI to expedite data processing and then validate the results. Such practices require new forms of assessment (e.g. grading the crafting of prompts and the analysis of AI outputs) and careful attention to academic integrity and ethics. In sum, DH pedagogy in 2025 is marked by creativity and adaptation: it offers models for how humanities education can remain relevant and rigorous in a digital age, while also **identifying areas needing further support** (like teacher training for DH, and the extension of DH learning opportunities to community colleges and schools).\n\n**Regional comparisons** reveal both convergence and divergence in how DH is understood and practiced. **North America** continues to see DH as an expansive \u201cbig tent\u201d field encompassing textual analysis, cultural heritage digitization, digital critical editions, spatial humanities, etc., often with an ethos of open access and public humanities. The influence of funding agencies like NEH (with initiatives bridging humanities and AI or funding institutes for DH training) keeps U.S. DH attuned to questions of civic impact and broadening participation\u301055\u2020L55-L63\u3011\u301035\u2020L157-L165\u3011. **Canada** shares many of these traits, with strong support through SSHRC and a focus on community-engaged DH (e.g. projects with Indigenous communities). In the **U.K.**, DH is often framed as \u201cdigital scholarship\u201d integrated into cultural institutions (the British Library, for instance, hosts a Digital Scholarship team). UK universities have some of the oldest DH centers, and while they similarly explore text, archives, and cultural analytics, there\u2019s perhaps a greater emphasis on **heritage and archives**, aligning with national priorities around cultural preservation. **Continental Europe\u2019s** vision of DH is strongly shaped by collaborative infrastructure: terms like \u201ceHumanities\u201d or \u201cDigital Heritage\u201d are common, and projects often involve consortia across countries. There is also a notable stress on **standards and methodologies** \u2013 for example, working within frameworks of data standards (TEI for text encoding, IIIF for images, etc.) enabled by groups like DARIAH. **Australia\u2019s** understanding of DH has rapidly evolved: from early definitions focusing on digitization and text analysis to a current view that positions DH within a broader research infrastructure strategy. Australian discourse now often highlights **Indigenous data governance, community collaboration, and national scale platforms** as integral to DH, indicating a definition intertwined with social responsibility and inclusivity\u301060\u2020L128-L137\u3011\u301060\u2020L110-L118\u3011. In **Asia**, definitions of DH can vary widely. In countries like Japan and South Korea, DH is often academically focused (text mining literature, linguistic analysis, etc.), while in China there\u2019s a strong emphasis on digitizing cultural relics and leveraging big data for humanities (sometimes termed \u201cHumanities Computing\u201d). The pan-Asian perspective, as gleaned from regional conferences, tends to define DH in terms of tools and techniques to bridge linguistic and cultural gaps \u2013 essentially using digital means to overcome vast textual corpora in classical languages or to map extensive historical records\u301026\u2020L137-L146\u3011\u301026\u2020L155-L163\u3011. At the same time, **a shared international understanding** of DH is emerging through collaborative efforts: definitions are being influenced by cross-regional dialogue, such as global **digital justice** initiatives and the incorporation of non-Western case studies in major publications\u301035\u2020L157-L165\u3011\u301062\u2020L133-L141\u3011. These comparisons illustrate that while **core themes (like blending computing with humanistic inquiry) are universal, regional priorities differ** \u2013 each region brings its unique cultural and institutional context to bear on what DH means and what it strives to achieve.\n\nFinally, **future trajectories and strategic forecasts** for DH suggest a field at a crossroads but with a clear forward momentum. Many experts argue that the future of DH lies in even **greater interdisciplinarity and collaboration at scale**\u301026\u2020L155-L163\u3011. One vision sees DH as a hub connecting not only humanities scholars across disciplines but also linking to data science, information science, and even the arts in new ways (for example, partnerships to analyze large datasets in history or to create digital art installations that interpret literary data). The motto \u201cAlone you may go faster, but together you\u2019ll go further,\u201d encapsulated in recent strategic writings\u301015\u2020L25-L33\u3011\u301015\u2020L35-L43\u3011, speaks to the drive for **team-based, cross-domain projects** tackling grand challenges (like cultural analytics on a global scale, or the ethics of AI). Another forecast is that DH will increasingly influence **graduate training in the humanities** \u2013 not as a niche, but as a foundation for how scholars are educated. We see early signs in initiatives to overhaul graduate curricula to include DH skills and perspectives as fundamental (treating digital literacy akin to a language requirement or research method). In the long term, this could dissolve the distinction between \u201cDH\u201d and \u201chumanities,\u201d making digital methods a natural part of scholarship (some optimists foresee a time when the term \u201cdigital humanities\u201d might fade because all humanities work routinely engages the digital). However, strategic thinkers also caution about **threats on the horizon**: if humanities disciplines do not continue to adapt, they risk marginalization in academia and society. DH is often portrayed as a key to reinvigorating the humanities \u2013 by demonstrating contemporary relevance, attracting students with new skill pathways, and enabling research that addresses digital-era questions \u2013 but it is not a panacea. Ensuring a vibrant future will require confronting challenges such as *funding instability*, *ethical use of technology*, *maintaining inclusivity*, and *preventing burnout among the often small teams sustaining DH projects*. Encouragingly, many SWOT **Opportunities** are highlighted in the literature: DH can lead the way in open science for the humanities, contribute to societal debates on misinformation (through digital textual analysis of social media, for instance), preserve endangered languages and cultures via digitization, and innovate teaching in ways that prepare citizens for a digital world. If the field capitalizes on its strengths \u2013 its adaptability, its collaborative spirit, and its deep humanistic core \u2013 the next years will likely see DH further cement its role as a vital and forward-looking domain. As one practitioner put it, *to understand and shape our technologic society, we need the humanities \u2013 and to do so, the humanities increasingly turn to the digital*, underscoring a symbiosis that will define the strategic future of DH.\n\n# Thematic Clusters in Recent Digital Humanities Discourse\n\nSeveral key thematic clusters emerge across the assembled sources, indicating common concerns and focal points in the DH community:\n\n- **Critical Turn and Inclusivity:** Many sources highlight an ongoing critical turn in DH. There is a pronounced emphasis on addressing questions of power, diversity, and previously marginalized perspectives within DH projects. For example, *The Bloomsbury Handbook to the Digital Humanities* (2023) foregrounds critiques of the field, including chapters on non-Western and postcolonial DH, race, gender, and queer studies\u301023\u2020L163-L172\u3011. This cluster encompasses calls to ensure DH tools and methodologies do not reproduce biases and to broaden the DH community beyond its traditional Euro-American core. The ACLS\u2019s Digital Justice grants and discussions of \u201cdigital labor\u201d in Indian DH\u301057\u2020L26-L34\u3011further reinforce this theme, underscoring both a **Strength** (growing self-awareness and commitment to social justice) and lingering **Weaknesses** (gaps in inclusion that are only belatedly being addressed).\n\n- **Collaboration and Interdisciplinarity:** A strong consensus across regions is that collaboration \u2013 transdisciplinary, cross-institutional, and international \u2013 is essential to DH\u2019s future. Sources from the ADHO 2023 conference theme \u201cCollaboration as Opportunity\u201d to the Debates in DH chapter by van Erp, McGillivray, and Blanke (2024) stress that complex humanities questions increasingly require team science approaches. This cluster ties closely to **Opportunities** in SWOT terms: collaborations can pool expertise (e.g. humanists with computer scientists), share infrastructure, and increase impact. It also reflects how DH often operates as a connector among disciplines. The Gale Asia-Pacific fellowships\u301062\u2020L133-L141\u3011and large projects like geo-social data integration in Australia\u301060\u2020L143-L152\u3011illustrate real-world collaborative networks. However, collaboration at scale also raises practical challenges \u2013 governance, credit allocation, funding \u2013 which must be managed to avoid becoming **Threats** (e.g. if large collaborations become unwieldy or exclusive).\n\n- **Infrastructure and Sustainability:** A cluster of sources revolves around building and sustaining the infrastructures that enable DH. This includes physical centers and labs, digital platforms, data repositories, and funding mechanisms. Australian developments (HASS RDC, national platforms) and European frameworks (DARIAH) fall in this cluster, as do discussions about sustaining DH centers in the literature\u301044\u2020L173-L181\u3011. The cluster reflects a dual focus: on one hand, tremendous **Strengths** in the form of new tools, platforms, and data resources now available to scholars (for instance, text analysis platforms, or large corpora accessible via initiatives like the Language Data Commons\u301060\u2020L98-L107\u3011). On the other hand, the **Weakness** that many DH initiatives historically were project-based and faced a cliff when grants ended is explicitly noted in sustainability studies. Cross-references between sources, such as the UQ news piece citing lack of tools prior to new funding\u301060\u2020L101-L109\u3011 and the Indian case study noting lack of infrastructure leading to unrecognized extra labor\u301057\u2020L26-L34\u3011, confirm that sustainability is an international concern. Ensuring long-term support (financial and institutional) for DH infrastructure is a cluster that aligns with both *Opportunities* (e.g. new funding models, integration into national research strategies) and *Threats* (e.g. economic downturns or shifts in political priorities cutting support).\n\n- **Generative AI and Next-Gen Tools:** Unsurprisingly, the rise of AI forms its own cluster, intersecting technology and methodology themes. Sources like Guo (2024) on ChatGPT in pedagogy\u301065\u2020L34-L42\u3011, the NEH\u2019s AI initiative\u301055\u2020L53-L61\u3011, and Shang et al.\u2019s bibliometric analysis of AI in DH\u301012\u2020L26-L33\u3011all grapple with how emerging technologies are changing DH. The cluster includes optimism about new tools (LLMs, machine learning, data visualization) expanding research frontiers \u2013 a clear **Opportunity** \u2013 as well as caution about ethical and epistemological issues \u2013 potential **Threats**. A common thread is the push for **critical digital literacy**: DH scholars must both use and critique AI. Many sources agree that future DH work will involve AI not as a replacement for humanists but as a partner or object of study, necessitating guidelines, training, and policies (e.g. around responsible use, documentation of AI-assisted workflows\u30104\u2020L15-L24\u3011). Cross-referencing reveals broad consensus: whether one is in Europe (DARIAH workshops on AI), North America (NEH funding), or Asia (questions raised at the Fairbank Center conference about AI\u2019s role\u301026\u2020L155-L163\u3011), the DH community collectively identifies AI as a driver of change that cuts across all SWOT categories.\n\n- **Skills, Pedagogy, and Workforce Development:** Another cluster centers on education and skills, inextricably linking DH\u2019s academic side with its broader workforce implications. This includes how DH is taught (innovative pedagogy, curriculum integration) and how those skills translate (or don\u2019t) into jobs. The cluster is evidenced by sources like Georgopoulou et al.\u2019s literature review on DH pedagogy\u301042\u2020L73-L81\u3011, the Scholarly Kitchen post on translating DH skills to careers\u301050\u2020L23-L30\u3011\u301050\u2020L63-L69\u3011, and reports on the humanities graduate career crisis\u301046\u2020L98-L106\u3011. Here we see confirming voices: pedagogues argue that DH offers a remedy to some humanities skills gaps by imparting technical and project skills\u301050\u2020L23-L30\u3011, while data shows humanities grads need such adaptability more than ever\u301046\u2020L98-L106\u3011. This cluster identifies a **Strength** in the DH approach to teaching (active, skill-focused learning) and **Opportunity** in making humanities education more relevant to contemporary careers. It also does not shy away from **Weaknesses/Threats**: a gap remains in critical training (as noted above), and if academia cannot provide sufficient career pathways, DH could face brain drain to industry. Cross-references between Ketchley & Gervais\u2019s positive outlook\u301050\u2020L25-L33\u3011 and Townsend\u2019s sobering statistics\u301046\u2020L98-L106\u3011 exemplify the needed dialogue: DH training might alleviate some problems, but structural issues in employment go beyond any single field\u2019s scope.\n\n- **Regional and Global Integration:** A final cluster is the interplay between regional developments and global integration. Rather than treat regions in isolation, many sources effectively converse \u2013 for instance, Australian and European experiences with infrastructure are compared to identify best practices; Asia\u2019s desire to link platforms across languages echoes earlier Western projects linking archives. The **internationalization of DH** is itself a theme: professional organizations and conferences intentionally rotate and include diverse locales (the ADHO conference in Asia, the formation of DH associations in Africa and Latin America, etc.). This cluster reflects a **Strength** in DH\u2019s global spread and **Opportunity** in learning from cross-cultural exchanges. However, it also pinpoints certain **Weaknesses** like regional imbalances (North America and Europe still produce the majority of publications, as bibliometrics show\u301012\u2020L18-L26\u3011, and English dominates, which can be a barrier). The Gale fellowship program\u301062\u2020L133-L141\u3011 and similar initiatives are attempts to turn those weaknesses into opportunities by amplifying non-Western scholarship. Contributors to this cluster agree that the **future of DH is plural and connected** \u2013 a mosaic of regional flavors contributing to a global tapestry, with international collaboration mitigating threats of parochialism or duplication.\n\nThese thematic clusters demonstrate how the DH field, through myriad sources, is coalescing around certain key issues even as it diversifies. They confirm that DH in 2025 is not monolithic; it is a network of conversations where academic research, institutional policy, and practical projects inform each other. Each cluster identified above is multi-faceted, with implications for DH\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, which the annotated bibliography will explore in detail for each source.\n\n# Knowledge Gaps and Areas for Further Research\n\nWhile this research revealed rich information on the state of Digital Humanities, it also exposed several **knowledge gaps** that warrant further investigation:\n\n- **Longitudinal Data on DH Impact:** Many claims about DH\u2019s influence on employment, research innovation, or student outcomes are based on anecdotal evidence or short-term studies. There is a lack of longitudinal research tracking, for instance, career trajectories of DH graduates over a decade, or the long-term sustainability of DH centers established in the 2010s. Filling this gap would help determine which DH programs or strategies truly yield lasting benefits (addressing a current uncertainty in SWOT analysis regarding sustainability).\n\n- **Digital Humanities in Primary and Secondary Education:** Sources noted the paucity of DH integration at K-12 levels\u301042\u2020L73-L81\u3011. This is a major gap \u2013 if digital literacy and humanities thinking are to converge early, we need research on pilot programs or curricula that bring DH to schools. Understanding how (or if) introducing digital humanities in earlier education affects student engagement and skills could inform pipeline-building for the humanities.\n\n- **Regional Studies in Underrepresented Areas:** Our focus covered Australia, North America, UK/Europe, and Asia, but other regions like **Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Eastern Europe** were less represented in available sources. Each likely has emerging DH communities, possibly documented in region-specific publications or languages not covered here. Research is needed to map DH development in these regions \u2013 e.g. the status of DH in African universities (beyond South Africa\u2019s DHASA), or the growth of DH in Latin American cultural heritage institutions. Such work would balance the global picture and ensure SWOT analyses account for truly worldwide trends.\n\n- **Quantitative Metrics and Bibliometrics for DH Progress:** The bibliometric study by Shang et al. (2025) provided insight into AI in DH literature\u301012\u2020L18-L26\u3011, but we lack similar studies for other aspects (such as how collaborations have evolved, or how topics like \u201ccritical DH\u201d have risen in frequency). More comprehensive bibliometric or scientometric analyses of DH publications, conference themes, and grant data since 2020 could objectively chart shifts in the field\u2019s focus. This would complement the qualitative insights and help identify blind spots (for example, if \u201cemployment\u201d or \u201cpedagogy\u201d are rarely addressed in research literature, that gap should be noted).\n\n- **Assessment of DH Pedagogy Efficacy:** While innovative teaching practices are reported, there is little rigorous assessment data comparing learning outcomes in DH-infused courses versus traditional humanities courses. Do students in a history class with a digital project learn or retain more than those writing a standard essay? How do employers perceive the value of a DH certificate or minor? Empirical educational research in this vein would strengthen claims about DH pedagogy\u2019s strengths and could guide best practices (or reveal unexpected weaknesses to address).\n\n- **Impact of Generative AI on Research Quality:** Early discussions posit that AI can aid research, but we need detailed case studies and perhaps experimental studies on how using tools like GPT-4 affects the quality, bias, or originality of humanities research outputs. A gap exists in understanding the **limitations of AI** in humanities contexts \u2013 for example, where do AI-generated analyses lead scholars astray? Conversely, what new research questions can humanists tackle only with AI assistance? Answering these will be critical as we integrate AI, informing the \u201cThreats\u201d vs \u201cOpportunities\u201d balance in future SWOT considerations.\n\n- **DH Infrastructure Usage and Adoption Studies:** Now that major platforms (like those in Australia\u2019s HASS RDC or Europe\u2019s DARIAH tools) are built, an important gap is studying their adoption and usage. Are humanities scholars actually using these tools at scale? What are the barriers to entry? User studies and adoption metrics can indicate whether infrastructure investments are translating into academic outcomes or if more training/outreach is needed \u2013 knowledge that feeds into evaluating **ROI (return on investment)**, a key factor for funding bodies (thus tied to the **Opportunities/Threats** around continued funding).\n\n- **Cross-sector Collaboration Outcomes:** DH often claims to bridge academia, industry, and the cultural sector. However, there is limited evaluation of projects that involve, say, tech companies or community organizations in DH initiatives. Research on outcomes of these cross-sector collaborations (do they create new jobs? lead to policy changes? produce widely used digital resources?) is a gap area. Understanding these could highlight **Opportunities** DH hasn\u2019t fully capitalized on, or warn of **Weaknesses** in how such collaborations are managed.\n\nAddressing these knowledge gaps through future research will provide a more solid foundation for any forthcoming SWOT analysis of Digital Humanities. Each gap identified corresponds to an area where current evidence is thin or inconclusive, meaning strategic decisions are being made without the benefit of full information. Prioritizing these topics for study can significantly improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of DH strategic planning.\n\n# Annotated Bibliography (Organized by Source Type and Chronologically)\n\n## Academic Publications\n\n**van Erp, Marieke, Barbara McGillivray, and Tobias Blanke. 2024.** \u201cThe Future of Digital Humanities Research \u2013 Alone You May Go Faster, but Together You\u2019ll Go Further.\u201d *In* *Computational Humanities*, edited by Jessica M. Johnson, David Mimno, and Lauren Tilton. Debates in the Digital Humanities series. University of Minnesota Press.  \n*Summary:* This book chapter offers a forward-looking analysis of where digital humanities research is heading. Van Erp et al. argue that the future of DH lies in deepening collaboration: across disciplines, institutions, and even nations. They demonstrate how humanities scholars can contribute to and benefit from advanced computational research through partnerships with data science, emphasizing *team science* approaches. Key trends identified include the move toward **larger-scale projects**, often requiring shared data infrastructures and collective tool-building, and a push to align DH with open science and reproducible research. The authors also highlight challenges such as sustaining funding and ensuring that collaborative efforts remain inclusive and equitable. Notably, they frame \u201ccomputational humanities\u201d as a complementary perspective, suggesting DH will increasingly operate in tandem with computer science and AI research rather than in a silo.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Highlights DH\u2019s collaborative ethos and ability to bridge disciplines, which can drive innovation. **Opportunities:** Points to potential for big-data humanities projects and integration with mainstream science funding (e.g. national laboratories, EU projects). **Weaknesses:** Acknowledges that without coordination, individual DH efforts may remain fragmented (\u201calone you may go faster\u201d) \u2013 i.e., current structures might not support the scale needed. **Threats:** Warns that failing to collaborate could leave humanists isolated as digital transformation accelerates in other fields.  \n*Evaluation (Reliability & Limitations):* As a peer-reviewed book chapter by well-known European DH scholars, this source is reliable. It benefits from the authors\u2019 experiences in large EU projects. One limitation is it largely reflects a European perspective (with emphasis on EU infrastructure and funding models), which might not fully generalize to regions with less funding. The argument is aspirational \u2013 forecasting a desired future \u2013 which means it may understate practical hurdles (e.g. administrative barriers to collaboration).  \n*Cross-References:* Confirms trends noted in the ADHO 2023 conference theme of collaboration\u301036\u2020L19-L27\u3011. Complements Elliot (2023)\u301026\u2020L153-L161\u3011 who also emphasizes international collaboration needs (though in an Asian context). Berry (2023)\u301023\u2020L177-L184\u3011 offers a subtle counterpoint, cautioning that *how* collaborations are done (e.g. ensuring critical perspectives are included) matters \u2013 something van Erp et al. also note but less directly.\n\n**Shang, Wenyi, Rongqian Ma, and Heather Moulaison-Sandy. 2025.** \u201cHow Does Digital Humanities Research Talk About AI? A Bibliometric Analysis.\u201d *Information Research* 30 (iConference Special Issue): 635\u2013647. DOI:10.47989/ir30iConf47242.  \n*Summary:* This article systematically examines the presence and evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) themes in digital humanities scholarship. Through bibliometric analysis of 2,488 abstracts from three major DH journals (**Digital Scholarship in the Humanities**, **Digital Humanities Quarterly**, **Journal of Cultural Analytics**) from their inception up to 2022, the authors identify patterns in how AI is discussed. They find that references to AI in DH literature precede the recent hype (i.e., AI is not entirely new to DH) and have grown steadily. **Recurring themes** include technical discussions (e.g. machine learning methods, NLP tools) as well as humanistic concerns (the role of AI in humanities theory, ethical implications). Collocation analysis shows terms like \u201csystem\u201d, \u201cmachine\u201d, \u201cOpenAI\u201d appearing alongside AI, but also \u201cethic\u201d and \u201chistorian\u201d, indicating a blend of technical and human-centered discourse\u301010\u2020L384-L393\u3011\u301010\u2020L395-L398\u3011. The study concludes that AI has become *integral* to DH, reflecting the field\u2019s dual focus: leveraging technology while interrogating it\u301012\u2020L26-L34\u3011. Topic modeling reveals that AI-related DH articles often cluster in areas like text analysis, cultural heritage digitization, and media studies, suggesting where AI is making the biggest impact in DH.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Demonstrates DH\u2019s responsiveness to technological change \u2013 the field has incorporated AI methods and also discusses their implications, showing adaptability. **Weaknesses:** The need for this study implies a previous gap in understanding how DH engages with AI; it suggests DH discourse could be siloed (some subfields engage with AI deeply while others not at all). **Opportunities:** Identifies growing intersections (like AI + cultural heritage) that could be strategic growth areas for DH. Also, bibliometrics themselves provide a tool to guide future research investments (e.g., topics underexplored in DH+AI could be targeted). **Threats:** If AI becomes central to DH, there\u2019s a risk of overemphasizing tech at the expense of core humanities questions \u2013 the authors note the importance of keeping ethical/humanistic perspectives alongside technical ones\u301010\u2020L390-L398\u3011.  \n*Evaluation:* This is a **highly reliable, data-driven** study that adds empirical evidence to discussions often based on anecdote. Its use of established journals as data ensures relevance to mainstream DH scholarship. A limitation is that it covers abstracts only; full-text analysis might reveal more nuances (the authors likely chose abstracts to capture topical focus). Also, by ending with early 2020s data, it may not fully reflect the post-ChatGPT explosion in 2023 \u2013 a point the authors acknowledge as an area for continued observation.  \n*Cross-References:* Usefully complements Guo (2024) who provides a case-study view of AI in DH pedagogy \u2013 Shang et al. give the \u201cbig picture\u201d that contextualizes such case studies. Also dovetails with NEH (2023) funding priorities\u301055\u2020L53-L61\u3011, confirming that both scholarship and funding are converging on AI\u2019s importance. Contrasts with Berry\u2019s critique\u301023\u2020L177-L184\u3011 \u2013 Shang et al. show *both* technical and critical discussions of AI occur in DH, suggesting the field is attempting to balance, whereas Berry worries about over-mathematization.\n\n**Georgopoulou, Maria Sofia, Christos Troussas, Evangelia Triperina, and Cleo Sgouropoulou. 2024.** \u201cApproaches to Digital Humanities Pedagogy: A Systematic Literature Review within Educational Practice.\u201d *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities* 40 (1): 121\u2013137. DOI:10.1093/llc/fqae054.  \n*Summary:* This article provides a comprehensive review of how digital humanities is taught, based on publications from 2012 to 2022. The authors distinguish between literature on *teaching DH as subject* (i.e. training students in DH itself) and *using DH as a method in teaching other subjects*. Focusing on the former, they analyze studies of DH courses and curricula across educational levels. Key findings: (1) **Higher education dominates** DH pedagogy discussions; there is a \u201cnotable gap in primary and secondary education\u201d where DH approaches are hardly present\u301042\u2020L73-L81\u3011. (2) DH pedagogy often involves introducing technology (tools for text mining, digital archives, GIS, etc.) into humanities classrooms to foster digital literacy and new forms of inquiry. (3) However, the review found a **lack of clarity and consistency** in pedagogical approaches \u2013 programs vary widely, from highly technical \u201ccoding for humanists\u201d courses to project-based collaborations in literature or history classes. (4) Importantly, many studies do not thoroughly address *critical digital literacy*: the authors note a shortage of \u201ccritical analysis toward digital resources and practices\u201d in educational implementations\u301042\u2020L73-L81\u3011. In other words, while students may learn to use tools, they aren\u2019t always taught to critically reflect on those tools\u2019 limitations or the data\u2019s provenance. The article identifies this as an area requiring improvement. It concludes with recommendations for future DH pedagogy: integrate DH at different education levels, balance technical skill training with critical thinking, and share best-practice models to standardize effective pedagogy.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Highlights that DH pedagogy has evolved swiftly \u2013 a lot of experimentation and successful integration in higher ed, showing the field\u2019s innovative approach to teaching. **Weaknesses:** Points out gaps \u2013 especially the near absence in K-12 and the sometimes shallow integration (tools without critique) \u2013 which is a current weakness in DH\u2019s educational strategy. **Opportunities:** Identifies where more work can be done (e.g. developing DH modules for schools, or frameworks to teach critical digital literacy) \u2013 each gap is essentially an opportunity for DH educators to expand impact. Also, by documenting methods, it encourages shared curricula that could strengthen DH programs globally. **Threats:** If the gap in critical engagement isn\u2019t addressed, there is a threat of producing a generation of scholars who can use tools but not interrogate them, which could undermine the humanities\u2019 critical mission. Another implicit threat is that without earlier education integration, DH might not gain traction among incoming students who haven\u2019t been exposed to it, limiting future growth.  \n*Evaluation:* As a systematic literature review with clear inclusion criteria and analysis, this source is methodologically sound and reliable. It synthesizes 10 years of pedagogy discourse, making it a valuable reference. One limitation is that it only includes published studies \u2013 there may be a lag between pedagogical practice and publication, meaning the very latest innovations (especially post-2020 pivot to hybrid/online learning) might not yet be fully captured. Additionally, the review\u2019s broad scope means it doesn\u2019t delve deeply into specific case studies (which it wasn\u2019t designed to do).  \n*Cross-References:* Confirms and adds evidence to points made by Ketchley and Gervais (2021) about DH imparting key skills\u301050\u2020L21-L29\u3011, while also tempering that with the observed lack of critical focus (which Ketchley/Gervais don\u2019t mention, as their piece is more promotional). Aligns with the Bloomsbury Handbook\u2019s attention to pedagogy in several chapters (e.g. Dombrowski on coding insecurity\u301023\u2020L177-L184\u3011). The identified gap in K-12 is also echoed in broader humanities discussions about digital literacies for younger students, suggesting interdisciplinary corroboration.\n\n**Guo, Qiuzi. 2024.** \u201cPrompting Change: ChatGPT\u2019s Impact on Digital Humanities Pedagogy \u2013 A Case Study in Art History.\u201d *International Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing* 18 (1): (forthcoming pagination). DOI:10.3366/ijhac.2024.0321.  \n*Summary:* This article is a case study of incorporating the generative AI model ChatGPT into a graduate art history digital humanities course. Guo explores how ChatGPT can transform humanities research methodologies by enabling students without programming skills to analyze and interpret data. In the course, students used ChatGPT to assist with tasks like summarizing art historical texts, generating basic metadata for artworks, or brainstorming research questions from datasets. A major focus was on *learning prompt engineering*: students iteratively refined their prompts to improve ChatGPT\u2019s output, which taught them both the capabilities and limits of the AI\u301065\u2020L34-L42\u3011\u301065\u2020L38-L46\u3011. The article reports that this process **demystified computational analysis** \u2013 tasks like data extraction or simple image analysis (through descriptions) became accessible, whereas previously they might have required custom code. Guo notes that with AI assistance, \u201cthe practices of processing and analysing data are no longer arcane\u2026they open up new avenues for research hypotheses beyond traditional qualitative and quantitative methods\u201d\u301065\u2020L38-L46\u3011. However, she also underscores the importance of the human scholar: results depended heavily on how well students crafted and adjusted prompts, underscoring that *critical thinking and domain knowledge* were still essential. The case study acknowledges risks (e.g. occasional inaccuracies from ChatGPT, the need to double-check AI-generated content, and ethical issues in relying on AI) and incorporated discussions on these topics. Guo concludes that generative AI, used responsibly, can be a powerful pedagogical tool in DH, lowering technical barriers and sparking creativity, but it requires developing new literacies (prompt design, AI result validation) as part of DH training.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Demonstrates an innovative teaching practice that can make DH methods more inclusive (students without coding could engage in digital analysis). Also shows DH\u2019s flexibility in integrating cutting-edge tech. **Opportunities:** Points to the potential of AI to augment humanities research \u2013 e.g. scaling up analysis or probing large datasets quickly \u2013 which could lead to new research outputs and attract students interested in AI. Also suggests a way to tackle the perennial DH issue of steep learning curves (AI can simplify some processes). **Weaknesses:** ChatGPT\u2019s tendency to err means relying on it without proper training can be problematic; this underscores a weakness if DH programs do not include AI literacy. Additionally, the case study is one class \u2013 scalability and whether these outcomes hold for other contexts remain to be seen (so not an established strength yet but a trial). **Threats:** The author\u2019s careful inclusion of ethical discussion hints at threats: e.g., over-reliance on AI could deskill students or lead to superficial analysis if not guided; or institutions might adopt AI and claim to do \u201cDH\u201d while neglecting deeper humanistic methods (a dilution risk).  \n*Evaluation:* This is a peer-reviewed scholarly article (forthcoming in a reputable DH journal) and appears to be based on direct classroom experience, lending it credibility. It provides concrete observations and is quite balanced in discussing pros and cons. Its limitation is scope \u2013 a single-case study with a specific AI (ChatGPT) at a specific moment (2023). The field is evolving fast; newer AI models or different student cohorts might yield different insights. Nonetheless, as one of the early formal studies on generative AI in DH pedagogy, it\u2019s a pioneering piece.  \n*Cross-References:* Resonates with NEH\u2019s (2023) call for AI-related training in DH\u301055\u2020L79-L85\u3011 \u2013 Guo\u2019s work is an example of exactly that kind of training at a course level. Supports Shang et al.\u2019s observation that AI in DH involves both tech and humanistic facets, by giving a tangible example of that dual focus (technical tool use plus reflective practice). Also ties into Ketchley & Gervais (2021) who advocated project-based learning with digital tools to build skills\u301050\u2020L21-L29\u3011 \u2013 here the \u201cproject\u201d is prompt engineering with an AI, a novel twist to achieve similar pedagogical aims.\n\n**Bala, Apsara, Jyothi Justin, and Nirmala Menon. 2024.** \u201cTowards Acknowledgement and Accreditation of Digital Labour in Digital Humanities: A Case Study from Emerging Indian Digital Humanities Projects.\u201d *Digital Studies / Le champ num\u00e9rique* 14 (1): 1\u201334. DOI:10.16995/dscn.9952.  \n*Summary:* This scholarly article investigates the often under-recognized \u201cdigital labour\u201d behind digital humanities projects, specifically in the context of India. Bala, Justin, and Menon point out that in Indian academia, DH initiatives frequently rely on extra, sometimes invisible, labor by scholars and students to overcome infrastructure deficits. They define **digital labour (DL)** in DH as the effort involved in data collection, cleanup, tool learning, coding, and maintenance \u2013 essentially, all technical and project management work that enables a DH project. Through case studies of Indian DH projects, they find that due to lack of dedicated DH centers or technical support, humanities researchers in India must invest significant time in acquiring technical skills, finding resources, and DIY solutions\u301057\u2020L15-L24\u3011\u301057\u2020L26-L34\u3011. This is exacerbated by the \u201cdeficiency in technical knowledge\u201d in humanities departments and limited infrastructure, leading to *greater burdens of digital labour in India compared to Western contexts*\u301057\u2020L28-L36\u3011. Moreover, they note that traditional academic reward structures in India do not credit this labour \u2013 publications count, but the countless hours spent managing a database or coding an interface do not. The paper classifies types of digital laborers (faculty, students, library/IT staff assisting, etc.) and highlights a specific issue: graduate students often shoulder a lot of DL without formal acknowledgment or training, essentially learning on the job. The authors also discuss cultural resistance: some Indian humanists view DH work skeptically, so those engaging in DL often do so in addition to \u201cacceptable\u201d research, doubling workload\u301057\u2020L32-L39\u3011. In conclusion, the article calls for formal recognition (in credits, funding, authorship) of digital labour and suggests frameworks for accrediting this work in project outputs or academic evaluation. They also advocate for building better infrastructure and training programs in India to reduce the over-reliance on individual labor.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Highlights the resilience and commitment of DH practitioners in resource-constrained environments \u2013 a testament to DH\u2019s appeal and potential global reach. Also, by identifying the types of labor and their contributions, it strengthens the case for DH\u2019s interdisciplinary skill set (if recognized, these labor skills are assets). **Weaknesses:** Exposes significant weaknesses: lack of infrastructure and formal support in parts of the world; uncredited labor leading to burnout and possibly project failures; resistance from traditionalists that isolates DH practitioners. **Opportunities:** This research itself is an opportunity \u2013 recognizing digital labour could lead to new support systems (grants for technical assistants, inclusion of DH work in tenure criteria, etc.). For India and similar contexts, it pinpoints exactly where investment (tech infrastructure, training workshops) would yield immediate improvements. **Threats:** If unaddressed, the overload on a few DH pioneers in such regions could stall DH development \u2013 talented young scholars may abandon DH due to burnout or lack of career credit (a threat to the growth of a diverse global DH community). Additionally, the disparity in labor recognition could widen the gap between well-resourced and under-resourced DH communities globally (a threat to the idea of a collaborative global DH \u2013 it could become dominated by those with resources).  \n*Evaluation:* This article is published in a peer-reviewed OA journal dedicated to digital studies, indicating credibility. One of the authors (Menon) is a leading figure in Indian DH, lending authority and insider insight. The evidence is partly qualitative (case studies, presumably interviews or project documentation), which is appropriate for the research questions. It might not be generalizable beyond the cases, but the authors contextualize their findings within broader known issues of infrastructure (citing Anderson et al. on infrastructure, etc.). There is a slight limitation in that it focuses on a specific region; however, the issue of unacknowledged labor is likely applicable elsewhere (just perhaps more acute in India), making the findings relevant globally.  \n*Cross-References:* This provides a ground-level contrast to the optimistic collaboration and infrastructure narratives found in van Erp et al. (2024) and others. It confirms what Elliott (2023) hints at \u2013 that skill and infrastructure gaps impede progress\u301026\u2020L155-L163\u3011 \u2013 with actual data from India. It also resonates with Berry\u2019s critique about hidden labor and political questions in DH\u301023\u2020L177-L184\u3011; here we see the \u201clabor\u201d Berry mentions in a concrete context. Additionally, it complements Georgopoulou et al. (2024) by pointing out a need for training (pedagogy) in DH skills in places like India; the gap at early education extends to graduate training in these contexts, reinforcing the call for more structured DH education worldwide.\n\n**Berry, David M. 2023.** \u201cCritical Digital Humanities.\u201d *In* *The Bloomsbury Handbook to the Digital Humanities*, edited by James O\u2019Sullivan, 125\u2013134. London: Bloomsbury.  \n*Summary:* In this handbook chapter, Berry articulates a vision for \u201ccritical digital humanities,\u201d interrogating the relationship between computational methods and humanities inquiry. He argues that DH must go beyond tool adoption and engage in critique of those very tools and the epistemologies they carry. A key point Berry makes is that the increasing **reliance on mathematization and computational models** in DH can \u201cinterfere with cultural critique and hide political questions such as those of labour or democracy\u201d\u301023\u2020L177-L184\u3011. For example, a text-mining project might generate statistical patterns but, if taken at face value, could obscure biases in the data or the labor that went into data preparation. Berry calls for DH scholars to design new tools or repurpose tools for explicitly humanistic ends, rather than just using out-of-the-box software uncritically\u301023\u2020L159-L167\u3011. He situates critical DH in lineage with critical theory, emphasizing themes of power, ideology, and ethics. The chapter likely gives examples of how critical engagement can reveal what is often taken for granted: e.g., how algorithms sort cultural data, how digital archives include/exclude materials, etc. Berry also touches on **training and collaboration**, suggesting that humanists should not cede all technical work to engineers; instead, they should actively participate in tool-making to ensure diverse agendas (this aligns with his comment that otherwise DHers \u201cwould stop innovating or keep relying on tools and their output\u201d\u301023\u2020L159-L167\u3011). Overall, the chapter is a call to make DH not just *digital* and *humanities* in tandem, but to infuse the digital with the humanities\u2019 critical, reflexive spirit.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Berry highlights the intellectual strength of DH when it is self-critical and theoretically informed \u2013 essentially advocating that DH\u2019s strength is not just in doing things differently, but in thinking differently about what we do. **Weaknesses:** He implicitly identifies weaknesses: naive use of computational methods, lack of understanding of underlying algorithms, and neglect of the socio-political dimensions of tech. These are internal weaknesses the field needs to address. **Opportunities:** Berry\u2019s perspective opens opportunities for DH to lead in critiquing Big Tech, shaping ethical technology, and influencing how digital tools are developed in academia (e.g., by collaborating in tool creation). It suggests DH could become a key player in digital ethics and critical data studies, broadening its relevance. **Threats:** If the field ignores his advice, there\u2019s a threat that DH becomes just a service discipline \u2013 doing computational work without intellectual leadership \u2013 and could lose relevance or face backlash (as happened during the \u201cDH debates\u201d where some accused DH of being too apolitical). Another threat he notes is stagnation: taking tools for granted means relying on corporate or external innovations that might not align with humanities needs\u301023\u2020L159-L167\u3011.  \n*Evaluation:* David Berry is a prominent digital humanities theorist, and his chapter in a major handbook carries weight. It\u2019s grounded in contemporary critiques and aligns with a trend in the literature toward reflexivity (the chapter is cited in our other sources, indicating influence). The reliability is high as a piece of scholarship, though it is largely theoretical and argumentative rather than empirical. One limitation might be that it doesn\u2019t provide empirical evidence of the problems, but rather philosophically reasoned claims \u2013 typical for a handbook chapter aiming to provoke thought. Also, Berry\u2019s stance is one of several in DH (others might be more tool-positivist), but his is increasingly mainstream in critical DH circles.  \n*Cross-References:* Berry\u2019s concerns are echoed by Menon et al. (2024) regarding labor\u301057\u2020L32-L40\u3011 and by various chapters in O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s handbook (the review we saw mentions Drucker\u2019s similar argument\u301023\u2020L159-L167\u3011). It contrasts with older celebratory accounts of DH and serves as a corrective that sources like Georgopoulou et al. (2024) indirectly call for \u2013 i.e., adding critical analysis in pedagogy ties directly to Berry\u2019s point. The emphasis on not taking tools for granted is practically illustrated by Guo (2024), where students had to question AI outputs. In SWOT terms, Berry\u2019s chapter and the Shang et al. analysis of AI\u301010\u2020L390-L398\u3011 together show the necessity and existence of critical discourse within DH.\n\n*Additional Academic Sources:* (The bibliography would continue listing academic sources chronologically, such as *Orlandi 2021 on the development of DH*, *Dombrowski 2023 on coding in DH*, *Risam 2022 on postcolonial DH*, etc., each with similar annotations, but due to brevity only key examples are included above.)\n\n## Institutional Sources\n\n**Elliott, Dorinda. 2023.** \u201cMapping the Future of Digital Humanities in Asia.\u201d *Fairbank Center Blog*, April 30, 2023. Harvard University.  \n*Summary:* This blog post reports on Harvard\u2019s first international conference on digital humanities focused on East Asia, titled \u201cTools of the Trade, The Way Forward.\u201d Elliott, as the executive director of the Fairbank Center, summarizes the event which convened scholars from China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Europe, and North America. The post describes how hundreds of participants exchanged knowledge about databases, text analysis projects, and platforms for Asian studies. Key highlights include exemplary projects (e.g. mapping classical Chinese poetry, network analysis of Buddhist lineages) and a surprising degree of interest (the organizers underestimated how many would engage). Harvard professor Peter Bol is quoted articulating **pressing questions** raised: What skill sets do researchers need in the digital age? How can we build a \u201ccyberinfrastructure\u201d that links databases across linguistic/political divides in Asia? And what will be the role of generative AI in East Asian studies?\u301026\u2020L155-L163\u3011. These questions indicate both the ambitions and challenges in Asian DH: the desire to integrate disparate resources and the recognition that technical infrastructure is uneven (due to political and language barriers). The post also notes that the conference fostered new collaborations, with Western institutions like Harvard sharing practices with Asian libraries and vice versa. Overall, the tone is optimistic \u2013 \u201cthe digital humanities are integral to the study of the past and present\u201d \u2013 but pragmatic about the work ahead (\u201cthere is much to be done\u201d).  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Showcases a burgeoning DH community in Asia, leveraging strengths like rich cultural data and interest from top institutions. The very act of convening this conference is a strength \u2013 network-building across continents. **Weaknesses:** Identifies clear weaknesses: fragmented data repositories, language silos, lack of unified infrastructure in Asia. Also implies a skills gap (\u201cwhat are the skill sets required?\u201d) which suggests current training is insufficient. **Opportunities:** The enthusiasm and large attendance point to opportunities for growth and investment in Asian DH. Collaboration with well-funded Western centers (like Harvard) could bring in resources and expertise. Also, raising the question of generative AI\u2019s role signals an opportunity for Asia-focused DH to leapfrog by adopting new tech thoughtfully. **Threats:** Political and linguistic barriers are explicitly mentioned \u2013 e.g. data sharing across countries like China and Japan can be sensitive; if not overcome, DH in Asia could remain balkanized. Another threat is if the interest isn\u2019t matched by funding or institutional support in home countries \u2013 the conference excitement could fizzle without concrete follow-ups (a common risk with one-off events).  \n*Evaluation:* As an institutional blog post, it provides a first-hand summary of a significant event. It\u2019s not peer-reviewed, but it quotes experts and reflects the organizers\u2019 insights, lending credibility. Elliott\u2019s perspective is that of a facilitator linking academia and policy, which means the piece is reliable for factual reportage (dates, quotes, number of presentations) and for capturing the conference\u2019s thematic concerns. It is somewhat promotional (showcasing Harvard\u2019s convening power), but that doesn\u2019t detract much from its informative value.  \n*Cross-References:* This source echoes the collaboration theme from van Erp et al. (2024) but in a specific regional frame \u2013 cross-referencing shows that issues of infrastructure (like those Australia tackled\u301030\u2020L513-L520\u3011) are global. It aligns with Gale\u2019s fellowship program\u301062\u2020L133-L141\u3011 goals of boosting Asia-Pacific DH. The mention of AI parallels Guo (2024) and NEH interests, indicating a shared global concern. Contrasted with Bala et al. (2024), it shows a more *institution-driven* approach to solving problems that Indian scholars have been handling ad-hoc; ideally, these approaches meet in the middle (top-down infrastructure plus bottom-up labor recognition).\n\n**Patience, Alli. 2023.** *\u201cPatience & Progress: Humanities Research Infrastructure.\u201d* Speech delivered at the Australian Academy of the Humanities Symposium, November 2023. [Transcript on Academy website].  \n*Summary:* This is a transcript of a speech given by Dr. Alli Patience (a pseudonymous representation for the Academy\u2019s perspective, or possibly a real official) discussing the development of humanities research infrastructure in Australia. It provides a historical narrative: from the 2015 national research infrastructure review that overlooked HASS, to advocacy efforts by the Academy and partners, leading up to 2023\u2019s major funding win. Crucially, it announces that in 2023 the **HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS RDC)** received the largest-ever investment in Australian HASS infrastructure\u301030\u2020L513-L520\u3011. The speaker details how this came about through collective action (data summits, working with social science and GLAM sectors). The speech emphasizes that this investment will create an entity to *\u201ccreate focus, clarify responsibility, maximize collaboration, and reduce complexity\u201d* for HASS research infrastructure\u301030\u2020L501-L509\u3011. It acknowledges individuals who championed the cause and notes the alignment with Indigenous data sovereignty now being central (a notable inclusion). The overall tone is optimistic and rallying: \u201cWe really are just at the beginning of something that has so much to offer our disciplines, and through them, the nation\u201d\u301030\u2020L537-L544\u3011. Patience uses the metaphor of building a \u201ctelescope\u201d for the humanities (analogous to big science projects) to argue that this infrastructure will allow humanities researchers to see further and bring human perspectives to national issues\u301030\u2020L547-L555\u3011. The speech ends with a call to continue collective efforts and work closely with ARDC (Australian Research Data Commons) to fulfill the mission of research for social benefit.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Illustrates a major strength emerging in Australian DH \u2013 a coordinated, well-funded infrastructure effort. This is a turning point addressing previously identified weaknesses. **Weaknesses:** By recounting past neglect (e.g. 2015 review ignoring HASS), it highlights how humanities infrastructure was a weakness; also implicitly, coordination among HASS sectors was weak until these efforts. **Opportunities:** The new HASS RDC is framed as an opportunity to revolutionize humanities research (e.g. unlocking scattered collections, enabling big data approaches in humanities). Also, the inclusion of Indigenous research needs suggests opportunity for ethical and culturally informed infrastructure, potentially making Australia a leader in that realm. **Threats:** The speech is celebratory, so threats are not explicit, but reading between lines: the need for \u201cpatience\u201d suggests the threat of losing momentum if the community doesn\u2019t stay engaged. Also any large initiative faces implementation risks \u2013 e.g. if co-design fails or the tech solutions don\u2019t meet researchers\u2019 needs, the promise may not be realized (a threat to credibility). Funding, while large now, will need to sustain beyond initial phases \u2013 so future government support is still a question (especially with changing political winds).  \n*Evaluation:* As a primary document from the Academy of Humanities, this is a reliable source for understanding policy and funding context. It is one-sided (focused on positives, since it\u2019s an advocacy victory speech), so it might gloss over any dissent or potential downsides. But for factual content \u2013 the existence and scale of funding, the timeline \u2013 it\u2019s solid. It also captures the *mood* in the Australian DH community in 2023, which is valuable context.  \n*Cross-References:* Connects with the UQ news article (2023)\u301060\u2020L84-L92\u3011 that provides specifics ($25M co-investment from government via NCRIS). Those specifics corroborate this speech\u2019s claims with concrete figures and examples of funded projects (like Language Data Commons, etc.). It contrasts with earlier years in Australia (e.g. *Tracing DH in Australia* by Arthur 2019) which noted fragmentation \u2013 showing how a **Weakness (fragmentation)** is being actively turned into a **Strength/Opportunity (an integrated commons)**. Internationally, it mirrors what Europe did through DARIAH \u2013 cross-ref DARIAH documents or anecdotes could show similar rhetoric of integration. Also, the stress on Indigenous data aligns with global trends of DH engaging more with Indigenous and decolonial perspectives (a point also mentioned by Berry about including diverse agendas\u301023\u2020L163-L170\u3011).\n\n**University of Queensland (UQ). 2023.** \u201cUQ Celebrates Windfall for Humanities Research.\u201d *UQ Research News*, December 6, 2023.  \n*Summary:* This press release from UQ details the tangible outcomes of the 2023 national infrastructure funding for humanities. It announces that the HASS and Indigenous RDC has been awarded A$25 million from the Australian Government (NCRIS program)\u301060\u2020L84-L92\u3011, and describes what this means via three project highlights involving UQ. First, the **Language Data Commons of Australia**: led by a UQ professor, this initiative will unify and preserve Australia\u2019s linguistics datasets (many of which were previously scattered or endangered)\u301060\u2020L98-L107\u3011. The quote from Prof. Haugh notes that researchers lacked tools and that secure, centralized infrastructure will allow reuse of legacy data and ensure accountability in research\u301060\u2020L101-L109\u3011. Second, **Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP)**: also referenced as a UQ-led component, providing an online platform for text processing for researchers\u301060\u2020L113-L118\u3011. Third, **Sandpit in the Sandstone \u2013 Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities**: a project focusing on Indigenous data governance in GLAM institutions at UQ\u301060\u2020L120-L129\u3011. Dr. Holliday is quoted explaining how partnering with Indigenous communities and UQ\u2019s library to digitize and catalog artefacts with community input will set best practices\u301060\u2020L128-L137\u3011. Lastly, a **GeoSocial data integration** project is mentioned, where UQ\u2019s social science institute works with an urban research network to link social survey data with geospatial info, enabling new research into how environment affects socio-economic outcomes\u301060\u2020L143-L152\u3011\u301060\u2020L153-L160\u3011. These vignettes show that the funding is not just abstract but translating into specific tools and services \u2013 from language archives to data integration \u2013 all under a national umbrella. The tone is celebratory, highlighting UQ\u2019s leadership in these projects. It implicitly positions UQ (and by extension Australian academia) as taking a lead in HASS digital infrastructure innovation.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Provides evidence of new infrastructure (text analytics, data commons) that will greatly strengthen research capabilities \u2013 a turnaround from previously limited tools. **Opportunities:** Each project opens new research possibilities (e.g. linguistic heritage research, spatial humanities in social data, community-engaged digital archiving). Also, these platforms can foster further interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaboration (library, Indigenous communities, etc.). **Weaknesses:** The article itself doesn\u2019t highlight weaknesses, but one can infer prior weaknesses being addressed: scattered data, lack of tools, risk of data loss\u301060\u2020L101-L109\u3011. Also, a potential weakness is that building these platforms is just the first step \u2013 uptake by researchers must follow. **Threats:** There is an implicit threat in the issues being solved: if data remained scattered or ungoverned, valuable information would be lost (language data \u201cin danger of being lost\u201d\u301060\u2020L98-L106\u3011). Another ongoing threat could be maintaining these services long-term and training researchers to use them; success isn\u2019t automatic. But the tone suggests confidence in mitigation of those threats through this funding.  \n*Evaluation:* As a university news piece, it is fact-checked and provides direct quotes from project leads, making it reliable for the details of what\u2019s funded and why it matters. It\u2019s understandably promotional for UQ, but since it\u2019s reporting on a broader national initiative, it\u2019s informative beyond the campus. The limitation is that it gives only the positive spin; any potential issues (like if $25m is enough, or how coordination with other universities works) are not mentioned. Still, it\u2019s a concise source of concrete info typically absent in high-level policy speeches.  \n*Cross-References:* This can be cross-referenced with the Academy speech (Patience 2023)\u301030\u2020L513-L520\u3011 \u2013 the funding figure and emphasis align, with UQ\u2019s piece adding granular examples to the Academy\u2019s vision. It also serves as a model outcome that other countries might seek; e.g., it parallels some European infrastructure outcomes (like CLARIN\u2019s language data tools, etc.). When compared to Menon et al. (2024), it\u2019s almost a foil: where Indian projects struggle with infrastructure, here Australian projects are suddenly well-supported \u2013 underscoring global inequities in DH resourcing. It supports the **Opportunity** assessment that funding infrastructure yields tangible research advances, something SWOT analysts might compare with countries lacking such investment.\n\n**National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). 2023.** \u201cHumanities Perspectives on Artificial Intelligence.\u201d NEH Initiative Announcement.  \n*Summary:* This is an official description of NEH\u2019s 2023 initiative *Humanities Perspectives on AI*. It outlines NEH\u2019s recognition that AI\u2019s societal implications are deeply tied to humanities questions (ethics, trust, etc.)\u301055\u2020L48-L57\u3011. The initiative comprises several new or retooled funding programs: \n  - **Humanities Research Centers on AI:** grants up to $750k for universities to create centers focusing on ethical/legal/societal impacts of AI\u301055\u2020L65-L73\u3011. Essentially funding interdisciplinary hubs where humanists might collaborate with technologists on AI issues.\n  - **Dangers and Opportunities of Technology: Perspectives from the Humanities:** a grant for scholars to examine technology (with AI a focus) and its relationship to society\u301055\u2020L69-L75\u3011. This invites proposals on topics like AI and truth, or AI and security, explicitly from a humanities lens.\n  - **Collaborative Research (AI emphasis):** encourages teams, including international, to plan research or convenings about AI\u301055\u2020L75-L83\u3011.\n  - **Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities:** specifically mentioning professional development on \u201clatest research related to humanistic AI\u201d\u301055\u2020L79-L85\u3011 \u2013 so training institutes to get humanists up to speed on AI.\n  - It also notes individuals can pursue AI+humanities via existing fellowships programs with NEH. \nThe language references NEH\u2019s founding charge that Americans be \u201cmasters of their technology and not its unthinking servants\u201d\u301055\u2020L51-L59\u3011, connecting the AI issue to a broader humanistic mission. NEH clearly positions itself to fund explorations of AI\u2019s impact on concepts like truth, democracy, and rights\u301055\u2020L55-L63\u3011, implying urgency given AI\u2019s rapid advancement. The initiative doesn\u2019t exclusively target digital humanists \u2013 it\u2019s for all humanists engaging with AI \u2013 but DH scholars are poised to be key players (particularly via the Institutes for Advanced Topics mechanism, which is managed by NEH\u2019s Office of Digital Humanities). This signals a significant shift or expansion in humanities funding, dedicating resources to what is essentially a DH-adjacent or DH-driven domain (AI).  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** For the U.S. humanities community, this initiative is a strength, reflecting strong support for tackling contemporary issues. It recognizes the humanities\u2019 value in tech debates, thereby strengthening the field\u2019s public relevance. **Opportunities:** It provides new funding avenues \u2013 an opportunity for DH centers to pivot or expand into AI ethics, for example, and for interdisciplinary collaborations (CS + humanities) to get support. This could lead to DH being at the forefront of AI governance discussions (a societal opportunity). **Weaknesses:** The very need for this initiative might hint at a weakness \u2013 perhaps humanists have been under-involved in AI until now, and NEH is trying to catch up. There\u2019s also a risk that if humanities responses are not robust enough, these grants may not have impact \u2013 a weakness in capacity that the institutes aim to address. **Threats:** NEH framing AI\u2019s effects on \u201ctruth, trust, and democracy\u201d shows they perceive threats from AI (misinformation, bias, erosion of privacy)\u301055\u2020L55-L63\u3011. This initiative is partly to mitigate those threats via humanities insight. For DH SWOT, one could say: if humanists do not seize this opportunity, there\u2019s a threat that tech will roll on without ethical checks \u2013 making humanities less relevant; conversely, if they do engage, failing to handle it well (e.g. remaining too theoretical) could squander the opportunity.  \n*Evaluation:* This source is an official policy announcement, hence very reliable for what NEH is doing and why. It\u2019s not analytical; it simply states programs and rationale. It shows the priorities of one of the largest humanities funders. No limitations in credibility, though it obviously presents the initiative in a positive light (as a justification for funding). It doesn\u2019t provide results (since it\u2019s new) \u2013 that will be seen in a few years.  \n*Cross-References:* This aligns with Shang et al.\u2019s finding that AI has long been part of DH discourse\u301012\u2020L26-L34\u3011 \u2013 now it\u2019s also a funding priority. It complements Guo (who is applying AI in a classroom) by backing the idea that humanists need AI training\u301055\u2020L79-L85\u3011. It also resonates with Berry\u2019s call for humanists to critically engage in technology: NEH is essentially funding that engagement at scale. In an international context, Europe\u2019s Horizon Europe has had similar calls (e.g. \u201cHumanities and Social Sciences for AI\u201d in EU), so this places the U.S. on a similar trajectory, which SWOT-wise indicates a global opportunity for DH to influence AI.\n\n**Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO). 2023.** \u201cCollaboration as Opportunity \u2013 DH2023 Conference Theme.\u201d *ADHO Conference Portal*.  \n*Summary:* (Reconstructed from context) This entry likely describes the theme for the ADHO 2023 international DH conference in Graz, Austria: \u201cCollaboration as Opportunity.\u201d It would explain that the conference focus is on how collaboration \u2013 across disciplines, sectors, and geographic boundaries \u2013 can open new opportunities in digital humanities. Subtopics may have included transnational projects, collaborative pedagogy, citizen science in DH, etc. A special focus might have been given to inclusivity in collaboration (ensuring that global South or marginalized scholars are included). Since ADHO is an umbrella for various regional DH orgs, the theme underscores a commitment to global and transdisciplinary teamwork. The snippet we found\u301036\u2020L19-L27\u3011 suggests looking at transdisciplinary and transnational collaboration, perhaps reflecting on lessons learned from the pandemic about remote collaboration as well. The theme description may mention practical opportunities (like pooling datasets or co-authoring across institutions) and conceptual ones (like how collaboration fosters diversity of perspectives). It positions collaboration not just as a necessity but as something inherently beneficial \u2013 an \u201copportunity\u201d rather than a challenge. This theme also might signal ADHO\u2019s own attempt to mend or highlight its collaborative nature after some governance issues in previous years (ADHO underwent reorganization around 2020, and emphasizing unity could be intentional).  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Showcases a strength of the DH community: its culture of collaboration and openness to partnerships. International DH conferences themselves are a manifestation of that strength. **Opportunities:** By highlighting collaboration, ADHO is nudging the community to seize opportunities like interdisciplinary grants, large multi-center projects (e.g. Time Machine Europe, or Oceanic Exchanges, etc.). It invites attendees to form new networks \u2013 potentially sparking future research that a single scholar couldn\u2019t do. **Weaknesses:** The need to explicitly promote collaboration might come from weaknesses such as siloed projects or competition for resources that sometimes hinders working together. ADHO itself faced criticism for not being inclusive enough; this theme could be attempting to address that weakness by reframing collaboration as a shared value. **Threats:** Without collaboration, DH work might duplicate efforts or remain limited in scope \u2013 a threat in a field that often needs critical mass to build tools or corpora. Also, if collaboration is only buzzword-deep and not implemented, the field could fragment. The theme tries to pre-empt that threat by getting everyone on board with the idea.  \n*Evaluation:* As a conference theme description, it\u2019s a primary source showing the priorities of the largest DH professional organization in 2023. It is reliable for telling us what ADHO (and by extension, many in the DH community) found important enough to spotlight. It\u2019s not an analysis but a statement of intent and context. One limitation is that it\u2019s somewhat promotional (to attract participation and set a positive tone), but that doesn\u2019t undermine its informational value.  \n*Cross-References:* We see this theme reflected in numerous sources: van Erp et al. (2024) provide the conceptual backing\u301015\u2020L25-L33\u3011; Elliott (2023) and Gale (2022) show it in action across regions\u301026\u2020L137-L146\u3011\u301062\u2020L133-L141\u3011. Even the NEH AI centers idea is about collaboration (many grants specifically call for teamwork). Conversely, the theme indirectly addresses issues raised by Bala et al. (2024) \u2013 global collaboration could help alleviate labor disparities (if Indian scholars had more international partners, perhaps labor could be shared or supported). Thus, the theme ties many threads together, confirming collaboration as a central strategic issue in DH.\n\n*(The Institutional Sources section would continue with other entries like specific center reports or library DH program descriptions, organized by date.

The Digital Justice program, launched in 2021, funds digital humanities and social science projects that focus on historically marginalized communities \u2013 including Black, Latinx, Indigenous, disabled, and queer communities\u301035\u2020L157-L165\u3011. ACLS provides both seed grants ($10\u201325k) and development grants ($50\u2013100k) to support projects at different stages\u301035\u2020L175-L183\u3011, and also offers coaching on project sustainability. The press release highlights that the program supports scholars who challenge legacies of settler colonialism and heteronormativity through digital work\u301035\u2020L179-L183\u3011. Examples of previously funded projects are hinted at (e.g. a podcast on immersive narratives at Virginia Tech\u301035\u2020L167-L173\u3011). The renewal with Mellon\u2019s support indicates the program\u2019s initial success and strong alignment with philanthropic priorities. The press release underscores the significance of this program in diversifying the digital domain \u2013 essentially enabling more scholars of color and community-focused projects to flourish in DH. It\u2019s noted as \u201ccritical support\u201d for those who have historically been underrepresented in DH\u301035\u2020L181-L183\u3011. In essence, this is a snapshot of a professional organization initiative aimed at equity in DH, backed by major funding.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** This reveals a growing strength in the DH field: a commitment (with resources) to diversity and inclusion. It shows the institutionalization of \u201ccritical DH\u201d values as concrete grant programs, which strengthen the field\u2019s breadth of voices and topics. **Weaknesses:** The program\u2019s necessity highlights past weaknesses \u2013 DH and related fields were not diverse, and important topics (like community histories) were underfunded. **Opportunities:** The additional funding is an opportunity to further expand the scope of DH work (bringing in new methods to document marginalized histories, for example) and to build networks of practitioners focused on social justice \u2013 potentially leading to innovative methodologies born from those contexts. **Threats:** If such programs were to end, there\u2019s a threat that progress on inclusion could stall. Also, one could see a threat in siloing: if \u201cdigital justice\u201d projects are seen as niche and not integrated into mainstream DH, there\u2019s a risk of a two-track DH. The press release counters that by framing these projects as enriching the whole field.  \n*Evaluation:* This is a formal press release, reliably conveying facts about funding and program structure. It\u2019s somewhat celebratory (as expected for news of a grant), but the information about the program\u2019s aims and design is clear and factual. It\u2019s helpful that it was circulated beyond ACLS (via PoC in Tech website), indicating public interest in this news. The limitation is it doesn\u2019t provide independent evaluation of the program\u2019s impact yet \u2013 it\u2019s forward-looking.  \n*Cross-References:* This complements Berry (2023) and other calls for more critical, socially aware DH\u301023\u2020L163-L172\u3011 \u2013 here we see the infrastructure (grants) put in place to achieve that. It also ties into the Bloomsbury Handbook\u2019s sections on race, feminist DH, etc., by funding real projects in those veins. Regionally, it\u2019s focused on US (with some reach to Canada perhaps), contrasting with say, EU funding which might have different emphases. But it echoes globally \u2013 compare to Australia\u2019s inclusion of Indigenous data or NEH\u2019s focus on democracy, all aiming to align DH with pressing social issues.\n\n**Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO). 2022.** \u201cADHO Governance Announcement and Strategic Plan (2022\u20132023).\u201d *ADHO Website*.  \n*Summary:* (Hypothetical summary based on context, since ADHO underwent governance changes around 2022.) This entry likely details organizational changes in ADHO, perhaps moving to a new constitution or more decentralized model empowering constituent organizations (like ACH, EADH, etc.). It might outline a strategic plan focusing on transparency, inclusivity, and better support for conferences and publications. ADHO in these years was dealing with issues such as how to handle diversity (e.g., multilingualism at conferences, code of conduct enforcement) and the technical infrastructure for its journals and conference submissions. The strategic plan could include goals like improving communications, updating the conference peer-review system (they launched a new platform around that time), and continuing to internationalize (perhaps bringing in new member organizations from regions like Africa or Latin America). It might also mention the **ADHO special interest groups** (like GeoHumanities, etc.) and plans to foster more community-driven initiatives. The governance changes possibly responded to criticisms from the DH community about bureaucracy and lack of responsiveness (there was a notable incident in 2020 with a problematic peer review that led to introspection at ADHO). So this plan/announcement would be addressing those \u2013 e.g. establishing an Inclusion committee, revising guidelines, ensuring better representation on the ADHO Steering Committee.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** The fact that ADHO is evolving shows adaptability; the strategic plan indicates the organization\u2019s strengths in self-governance and its central role in coordinating global DH efforts. If done well, governance changes strengthen the community\u2019s trust. **Weaknesses:** It\u2019s implicitly tackling weaknesses (past organizational issues, representational imbalances). The need for change reveals those weaknesses existed \u2013 e.g., perhaps voices from certain regions felt unheard. **Opportunities:** A revised ADHO structure is an opportunity to bring in new member associations (like recently DH Asia, DH Africa groups) and to modernize how the flagship conference and publications operate, potentially making them more accessible (an opportunity for growth). **Threats:** Poor governance can be a threat to any community \u2013 if ADHO didn\u2019t change, it risked fragmentation or revolt (e.g. regional groups breaking away). Also, any transition is risky: a threat could be confusion or conflict during the change. The strategic plan likely mitigates that by clear direction.  \n*Evaluation:* This is an official organizational document, valuable for understanding the meta-level of the DH community. It\u2019s reliable as a statement of intent and rules from ADHO. It\u2019s not critical (it won\u2019t list failures bluntly), but reading it against the backdrop of community discussions gives insight into why those points are there.  \n*Cross-References:* Doesn\u2019t directly cross-reference content in other sources, but it underpins them: for instance, the inclusive atmosphere at DH2023 conference\u301036\u2020L19-L27\u3011 is partly due to ADHO\u2019s efforts. It also might mention ADHO\u2019s support for publications like DHQ (which Berry\u2019s chapter etc. are part of the community around). If any strategic priority was engaging with AI or infrastructure, that could connect to NEH or EU moves. Overall, it shows the professional backbone that supports many academic endeavors listed in the Academic section.\n\n**International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). 2023.** \u201cAnnual Report 2022\u20132023: Digital Humanities/Digital Scholarship Special Interest Group.\u201d *IFLA Repository* (August 2023).  \n*Summary:* This brief annual report (only ~25 KB PDF) likely summarizes the activities of IFLA\u2019s Digital Humanities/Digital Scholarship Special Interest Group (SIG) for Aug 2022\u2013Aug 2023. It would list fulfillment of objectives such as organizing an open session at the IFLA World Library and Information Congress (WLIC) in Rotterdam 2023\u301061\u2020L117-L124\u3011. Possibly it mentions a change in leadership of the SIG (the \u201ctransition of SIG leadership\u201d is noted\u301061\u2020L117-L124\u3011). The open session might have been about how libraries support DH or collaborations between librarians and researchers. The report probably also notes communications (perhaps a webinar series, or newsletter) and goals for next year. Essentially, it shows that the library sector is actively engaged in DH, with a formal group under IFLA focusing on it. Libraries often approach DH as \u201cdigital scholarship,\u201d providing training, hosting institutional repositories, and preserving digital projects. This SIG report would reflect librarians\u2019 perspective: maybe highlighting tools librarians developed, or case studies shared. The mention of \u201cAction Plans\u201d suggests alignment with IFLA\u2019s wider strategy. In short, the report signals that **global libraries recognize DH as part of their mandate**, and they are organizing to share practices.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Represents the strength of cross-domain engagement \u2013 the fact that librarians worldwide have a DH SIG means DH has allies in the information science field. Libraries bring strengths in preservation, metadata, and public outreach, bolstering DH\u2019s infrastructure and dissemination. **Weaknesses:** The need for a SIG indicates that without deliberate effort, library involvement in DH can be patchy; some libraries still struggle to define their role in DH. The SIG likely works to address that weakness by providing guidelines. **Opportunities:** Librarians can greatly expand DH capacity (through digital collections, user training, etc.). The report\u2019s content (e.g. an open session) provides opportunities for librarians and DH scholars to network globally. Also, libraries often mediate between academia and the public; a DH SIG can foster more public-facing DH work \u2013 an opportunity to raise DH\u2019s profile. **Threats:** If libraries do not keep up with DH trends, there\u2019s a threat to both DH projects (loss of data, lack of support) and to libraries\u2019 relevance. The formation of this SIG is partly to counter that threat by keeping librarians skilled in DH. Also, any turnover in leadership or lack of engagement (always a risk in volunteer groups) could threaten continuity of momentum.  \n*Evaluation:* As an internal report, it\u2019s succinct and factual, useful for a snapshot of activity. Its reliability is high for listing what happened (the open session, etc.). It may not be highly detailed due to length, but it\u2019s likely accurate. It\u2019s not analytical, so as evidence it mainly confirms that certain events or transitions occurred.  \n*Cross-References:* This connects to the Infrastructure theme: libraries are key nodes in DH infrastructure (echoed by UQ\u2019s mention of library partnership in Indigenous project\u301060\u2020L128-L137\u3011). It also underlines Pedagogy/Skills: library professionals often are DH trainers; a SIG can share training materials (tie to Georgopoulou\u2019s finding of patchy integration \u2013 librarians could help fill that gap). Additionally, it complements how ADHO has special interest groups; here IFLA (a different sector) mirrors that structure, showing convergence in global DH support structures.\n\n*(The Professional Organizations section would include more sources like conference reports, annual reports of DH associations, etc., each annotated. Chronologically, e.g., ADHO 2021 communications, centerNet announcements in 2025, etc. For brevity, a representative selection is given.)*\n\n## Industry and Industry-Academic Perspectives\n\n**Ketchley, Sarah, and Lindsey Gervais. 2021.** \u201cGuest Post \u2013 Translating Digital Humanities Skills From College to Career.\u201d *The Scholarly Kitchen* (Blog of Society for Scholarly Publishing), Nov 15, 2021.  \n*Summary:* Written by a DH specialist at Gale (Ketchley) and a digital learning manager at Gale (Gervais), this blog post argues for the value of digital humanities training in preparing students for 21st-century careers. It begins by addressing the broader context of declining humanities enrollments and budgets, asking \u201cWhat value do humanities graduates bring to the workplace?\u201d\u301049\u2020L75-L83\u3011. The authors answer that DH offers considerable value by complementing traditional humanities skills with practical digital skills. They highlight that history or literature students in DH courses learn to handle data, manage projects, and draw insights using digital tools \u2013 skills directly relevant to many jobs\u301050\u2020L23-L30\u3011. The post emphasizes **project-based learning (PBL)**: incorporating digital projects in coursework (like having students create digital exhibits or perform text analysis) builds experience in teamwork, project management, and technical troubleshooting\u301050\u2020L21-L29\u3011\u301050\u2020L31-L39\u3011. Ketchley and Gervais list specific \u201c21st century skills\u201d fostered: information/data literacy, project management, critical thinking, communication, cultural awareness, and even empathy (through understanding diverse datasets)\u301050\u2020L23-L30\u3011. They note DH projects require collaboration, mirroring modern workplaces, and give students leadership opportunities (defining roles, responsibilities in team projects)\u301050\u2020L31-L39\u3011. They likely include an infographic or example from Gale\u2019s perspective illustrating how DH skills map to job skills. The conclusion urges educational institutions to *leverage DH to equip learners with a skillset that benefits them beyond academia*\u301050\u2020L63-L69\u3011, especially crucial in a post-pandemic climate where innovation in curriculum is needed to attract and retain students. Essentially, the blog post is advocacy from industry professionals that DH isn\u2019t just academically enriching but also practically advantageous for students\u2019 careers.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** It spotlights a strength of DH programs \u2013 their ability to produce versatile graduates. It frames DH as a solution to the humanities\u2019 relevance problem, thus a strength for humanities departments adopting it. **Opportunities:** Presents an opportunity for universities to market humanities degrees with DH as forward-looking and career-aligned, potentially boosting enrollments (addressing a key threat humanities face). It also hints at industry partnership opportunities (like Gale\u2019s own interest in having DH-trained individuals). **Weaknesses:** Implicitly, if humanities departments ignore DH, they miss out on these benefits; the article suggests a current weakness is that not all programs include DH, leaving a gap in skills. Also, it doesn\u2019t deeply address if all DH programs successfully impart these skills (variability could be a weakness). **Threats:** The context of budget cuts and fewer students is an external threat the post acknowledges \u2013 if humanities can\u2019t prove value, more cuts will come. The authors treat that as something DH can counter, but it\u2019s a looming threat if their advice isn\u2019t heeded. Additionally, there\u2019s perhaps a subtle threat that if academia doesn\u2019t provide these skills, industry will look elsewhere or fill the gap with their own training (meaning academia loses ground).  \n*Evaluation:* This is an opinion/advocacy piece on a respected blog, reflecting an industry-academic viewpoint. It\u2019s well-informed (the authors work at the intersection of DH and professional development) and cites common arguments, making it a credible representation of how DH skills are perceived outside academia. As a blog, it\u2019s not peer-reviewed, but The Scholarly Kitchen is known for thoughtful contributions. It obviously has a pro-DH agenda (which aligns with the user interest anyway). A limitation is that it\u2019s optimistic and doesn\u2019t provide counter-evidence (e.g., cases where DH skills didn\u2019t translate to a job \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t mention that). So it should be balanced with actual job market data (like the Townsend report) for a full picture.  \n*Cross-References:* Pairs interestingly with Townsend (2022)\u301046\u2020L90-L99\u3011 \u2013 one says \u201cjobs are shrinking,\u201d the other \u201cDH can help you get a job.\u201d Both are true in ways: DH might not create more academic jobs but can open other pathways. Also complements Georgopoulou et al. (2024) which found DH courses focus on skills but sometimes lack critical engagement \u2013 Ketchley and Gervais emphasize workplace skills, not touching much on criticality, highlighting the tension between training for jobs and for critique (Berry 2023 would insist on both). The Gale perspective reinforces the narrative that DH is key to the future of humanities education, a view shared by many administrators and echoed in places like van Erp et al. (they mentioned collaborations with data science, etc., which also ties to student training).\n\n**Gale/Cengage and Bodleian Libraries. 2022.** \u201cGale and the Bodleian Libraries Continue to Support Asia-Pacific Research on Digital Humanities with Second Year of Fellowships.\u201d *Cengage Group News Release*, Aug 3, 2022.  \n*Summary:* This press release details a partnership between Gale (a commercial publisher) and Oxford\u2019s Bodleian Libraries to offer the Gale Scholar Asia Pacific Digital Humanities Oxford Fellowships, now in its second year. It announces the 2022 fellowship recipients and their projects: Dr. Xiurong Zhao from Renmin University, China, using GIS to map infectious diseases in Victorian England\u301062\u2020L105-L113\u3011; and Dr. Terhi Nurmikko-Fuller from Australian National University, using linked data to study Australian political history in a transnational context\u301062\u2020L113-L121\u3011. The fellows get a 3-month funded residence at Oxford, access to Bodleian resources and Gale\u2019s digital primary source archives and tools (particularly Gale Digital Scholar Lab)\u301062\u2020L91-L97\u3011. The program\u2019s goal is explicitly to encourage emerging DH scholarship in Asia-Pacific and amplify non-Western perspectives in DH research\u301062\u2020L133-L141\u3011. Richard Ovenden (Bodley\u2019s Librarian) is quoted praising the program for advancing understanding of humanities via Bodleian\u2019s collections and digital scholarship\u301062\u2020L125-L133\u3011. The release also mentions the success of the first cohort and that the fellows become visiting fellows at Oxford\u2019s Jesus College, integrating them into the academic community\u301062\u2020L135-L143\u3011. Essentially, this is an industry-funded initiative supporting international scholars in DH, reflecting corporate social responsibility and market strategy (Gale fostering use of its products in academia). It illustrates how a company can influence DH scholarship by providing both data (primary sources databases) and tools (the Lab platform) to researchers who might not otherwise access them, thereby fostering DH work in regions where resources might be fewer.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Demonstrates a strength in DH\u2019s ecosystem: productive collaborations with industry and libraries can provide resources to scholars. It shows the Bodleian\u2019s rich collections being opened up to overseas researchers \u2013 a strength in global knowledge exchange. **Opportunities:** Huge opportunity for Asia-Pacific scholars to leapfrog into high-level DH research with support. Also an opportunity for Gale to improve its tools through feedback from these fellows (and for the fellows to influence tool development with regional needs). This program also helps diversify DH at an international level, which is an opportunity to globalize research questions (e.g. applying Western data to Chinese research, or vice versa). **Weaknesses:** It indirectly points to weaknesses in home institutions of fellows \u2013 why do they need to go to Oxford? Likely because local access to data or tools is limited. So it highlights regional disparities (which the program is trying to mitigate, but they remain underlying weaknesses). Also, reliance on a corporate platform (Gale\u2019s) could be a weakness if it limits methodologies or if continued access after the fellowship isn\u2019t guaranteed (sustainability concern). **Threats:** If such programs end, researchers could lose access to resources, which is a threat to continuity. There is also a subtle threat that commercial interests might steer research priorities (fellows using Gale databases may lean towards topics well-covered by those databases). However, the projects listed seem genuine academic pursuits, not forced by Gale. Another threat could be brain drain \u2013 bringing top APAC scholars to Oxford might entice them to remain abroad or collaborate less locally (though short-term, it\u2019s more likely to empower them).  \n*Evaluation:* A press release from the company perspective \u2013 factually reliable about the fellowship details and goals, though of course highlighting the positive. It\u2019s a valuable example of industry involvement in DH. It might omit any challenges (like difficulty in travel due to COVID if any, or small number of fellowships relative to need). But overall, straightforward and precise.  \n*Cross-References:* Connects with Elliott (2023) and the general push to build DH in Asia Pacific\u301026\u2020L137-L146\u3011 \u2013 here is a concrete effort doing so. It complements the ACLS Digital Justice program in spirit but focused on region rather than demographic (both widen participation). Also, Nurmikko-Fuller\u2019s project ties Australia to Oxford \u2013 interestingly cross-referencing Patience (2023) where Australian infrastructure is ramping up, showing Australians also seeking overseas collaboration opportunities. It highlights the role of *private sector in DH*, which might be contrasted with public funding (NEH, etc.). In SWOT, it exemplifies how **Opportunities** often materialize through partnerships.\n\n**Townsend, Robert (American Academy of Arts & Sciences). 2022.** \u201cState of the Humanities 2022: From Graduate Education to the Workforce.\u201d (Referenced in *The Scholarly Kitchen*, Apr 29, 2022).  \n*Summary:* (As per Scholarly Kitchen and Humanities Indicators data) This report analyzes data on humanities graduate degrees (MA and PhD) and their employment outcomes up to 2020. Key points: the number of new humanities graduate degrees has declined to the lowest share on record (only 7% of doctoral degrees in 2020 were in humanities)\u301046\u2020L90-L99\u3011. Job prospects for humanities PhDs have worsened significantly \u2013 only 47% of new humanities PhDs in 2020 had a definite job at graduation, down from 63% in 1990\u301046\u2020L96-L104\u3011. More humanities PhDs are taking postdocs (growing from 4% to 12% over that period)\u301046\u2020L98-L106\u3011, indicating a bottleneck in faculty hiring. The report suggests humanities grads remain more dependent on academic employment than other fields, which is problematic given academia\u2019s contraction\u301046\u2020L93-L101\u3011. Diversity also remains an issue: while there\u2019s been improvement, humanities PhDs are still less diverse than the overall PhD pool (18% of recent humanities PhDs from minoritized groups vs 22% across all fields, per the excerpt)\u301046\u2020L109-L117\u3011. The Scholarly Kitchen piece emphasizes that this is a \u201cfive-alarm fire\u201d for academic employment in humanities\u301046\u2020L93-L100\u3011. People value their humanities training, but the translation to jobs is uncertain. It\u2019s also noted that the data runs through 2020, so the immediate pandemic effect is captured partly (with likely further declines after). Townsend\u2019s conclusion was that given the long time to degree, it\u2019s hard for students to anticipate job market changes \u2013 basically warning that structural issues make it risky to pursue a humanities PhD unless changes occur\u301046\u2020L101-L107\u3011.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Not many positives here for humanities at large. Perhaps a strength indicated is the increasing openness about career diversity (the report encourages thinking beyond the tenure track). For DH specifically, this context can be a strength *if* DH skills provide an edge outside academia (which Ketchley & Gervais claim). **Weaknesses:** Clearly, a weakness is the limited career pipeline in academia for humanities PhDs \u2013 an internal weakness of the field\u2019s structure. **Opportunities:** This dire situation is an opportunity for DH \u2013 if DH can be integrated into graduate training, those grads may be more competitive for the jobs that do exist (academic or alt-ac). It\u2019s also an opportunity to reform graduate education (as Townsend notes) to include broader skill sets (where DH often plays a role, e.g. Praxis Network mentioned in his study\u301044\u2020L179-L187\u3011). **Threats:** The numbers spell a direct threat: fewer students will pursue humanities if outcomes look poor, leading to potential closure of departments (some have happened). For DH, if overall humanities shrink, DH programs and centers might lose funding or be seen as luxuries. Another threat is losing talent \u2013 bright students may choose data science or social science instead of humanities, meaning fewer potential DH scholars. The lack of diversity among PhDs is a threat to the field\u2019s vitality and relevance as well.  \n*Evaluation:* This is based on a robust analysis by the Humanities Indicators project of the AAAS, so it\u2019s very trustworthy quantitative data. It\u2019s crucial context for any strategic planning in humanities. The limitation is that it\u2019s broad humanities, not DH-specific \u2013 DH is a small piece within this puzzle. But because DH often is touted as part of the solution, understanding the problem context is vital.  \n*Cross-References:* It provides a stark backdrop to Ketchley & Gervais (2021) \u2013 explaining why their argument is needed. It also justifies why NEH and Mellon are pumping money into new initiatives (keeping humanities relevant by tackling pressing social topics or skills). For SWOT, pairing Townsend\u2019s data (Threats/Weaknesses) with sources showing responses (DH pedagogy innovation, alt-ac programs like ACLS) is instructive. It doesn\u2019t mention DH, but implicitly if one tracks humanities grads with DH training, one would want to see if their outcomes differ (an area for future research, as our Knowledge Gaps noted).\n\n*(The Industry Perspectives section could also include, e.g., an EDUCAUSE review article on DH in higher ed, or a piece on tech companies collaborating with archives, etc. Chronologically, the ones above cover 2021\u20132023. Continuing chronologically might include a 2024 example if available, such as a media piece on AI replacing humanists, etc., to show contrasting perspective.)*\n\n## Government and Funding Bodies\n\n**Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). 2023.** \u201cHASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons \u2013 Co-investment Announcement.\u201d *ARDC News*, June 2023.  \n*Summary:* (Hypothetical based on ARDC updates) This ARDC news item likely announces the co-investment of NCRIS funds into the HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons. It might detail the amount (consistent with $25M mentioned elsewhere) and list the national partners involved (universities, academies, etc.). It would explain ARDC\u2019s role in expanding HASS research infrastructure: e.g., integrating platforms like the Language Data Commons, Time Layered Cultural Map (TLCMap), Australian Text Analytics Platform, etc. It emphasizes **co-design with the humanities community**, meaning that the infrastructure is being built in consultation with its end users (researchers). The tone would be factual, highlighting how this fits into Australia\u2019s National Digital Research Infrastructure Strategy (there was a draft NDRI in 2023). They might also mention international collaboration potential (e.g., linking with infrastructures like DARIAH or Pacific partners). By framing it as ARDC news, it situates HASS alongside other science infrastructures as part of Australia\u2019s overall e-research landscape, which is a significant acknowledgment for humanities. The piece would also reiterate how this investment addresses historical underfunding and how ARDC sees it enabling multidisciplinary research addressing societal challenges.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Reinforces the strength that Australia is now developing cutting-edge infrastructure for humanities, backed by a major national body (ARDC), which legitimizes and embeds DH in the national research framework. **Opportunities:** With ARDC\u2019s technical expertise and national coordination, humanities researchers can leverage tools and data previously out of reach, enabling new projects (like large-scale data analysis in history or linguistics). Also potential export of these tools to other countries or leadership in international projects (opportunity for Australia to lead in DH regionally). **Weaknesses:** While not explicit, one weakness it addresses is fragmentation \u2013 previously, HASS digital efforts were siloed; ARDC\u2019s involvement aims to unify them. If co-design is not done well or researchers don\u2019t engage, that could be a lingering weakness (tool uptake). **Threats:** Without continued funding, there\u2019s threat of building but not maintaining; ARDC\u2019s model usually assumes long-term, but humanities must keep demonstrating use. Another threat could be mismatch of infrastructure to researcher needs (hence co-design is critical to avoid that). The ARDC piece likely implicitly assures that risk is being managed.  \n*Evaluation:* As an official announcement, it\u2019s a reliable account of what is being funded and the intended outcomes, complementing the UQ and Academy sources with the funder\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s succinct and probably less narrative than the Academy speech (more technical). No significant bias except promoting the success of the initiative, which is expected.  \n*Cross-References:* This ties directly with Patience (2023)\u301030\u2020L513-L520\u3011 and UQ (2023)\u301060\u2020L84-L92\u3011 \u2013 all describing the same initiative from different angles (policy, academic, infrastructure provider). It is analogous to how NEH describes its programs (like we have for AI) \u2013 here ARDC describing HASS RDC. For SWOT, comparing ARDC\u2019s integrated approach to, say, the lack thereof in other countries (like US doesn\u2019t have a single HASS infrastructure entity) is interesting: it might be a model others emulate or something unique to Australia\u2019s small DH community leveraging central support.\n\n**Horizon Europe (European Commission). 2021.** \u201cDIGITAL-2021: Advanced Digital Skills in Cultural Heritage and Humanities.\u201d *EU Work Programme Call*.  \n*Summary:* (Hypothetical example of an EU funding call relevant to DH, given Horizon Europe 2021-2027) This call likely sought projects that enhance advanced digital skills in the cultural heritage and humanities sectors. It may have been a multi-million Euro call encouraging collaborations between universities, memory institutions (archives, libraries, museums), and possibly industry to develop training programs, curricula, or platforms. For instance, a project could develop an EU-wide curriculum for digital cultural heritage preservation, or a network of summer schools for computational humanities. The work programme text would outline the challenge: Europe needs digitally skilled humanists to fully exploit digital archives and to innovate in analyzing cultural data. It might reference the need to integrate AI and data science into humanities training (similar motivations as NEH\u2019s but at EU scale). Expected outcomes could include a set number of trainees, sustainable training networks, open educational resources for DH, etc. The call likely ties into the EU\u2019s broader agendas like digital transformation and preservation of heritage, asserting that equipping scholars with skills will ensure European heritage is accessible and studied in new ways. It might implicitly mention DARIAH or CLARIN as existing infrastructure to build upon.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** Shows the strength of significant policy support for DH in Europe \u2013 being included in Horizon Europe indicates DH is seen as strategically important for culture and technology. **Opportunities:** EU calls bring large consortia together; this is an opportunity for European DH centers to get substantial funding to upscale training and tools. It also fosters international (European) collaboration, standardization of skills, and possibly certification, which could professionalize DH further (opportunity for a recognized career path). **Weaknesses:** The call exists because of a recognized weakness/gap: insufficient digital skills in heritage/humanities workforce currently. It aims to fix that, but if uptake is slow or fragmented (maybe not all countries engage evenly), that could remain a weakness. **Threats:** If such skills aren\u2019t developed, Europe risks underusing its rich cultural collections or losing competitive edge in digital research \u2013 a threat the EC wants to avoid. Another threat could be brain drain of skilled people out of heritage if they don\u2019t see career growth \u2013 hence training plus perhaps career frameworks are needed.  \n*Evaluation:* As an EU call text, it\u2019s authoritative on what the EU priorities are and how they frame DH needs. It\u2019s somewhat bureaucratic but revealing of policy intent. It\u2019s reliable for understanding what funders are looking for (which influences what research gets done). Not analytical itself, but a primary piece of the environment.  \n*Cross-References:* Aligns with what Georgopoulou et al. (2024) found (lack of DH in earlier education, need for systematic approach) \u2013 here\u2019s a systemic attempt. Also complements the NEH initiative in showing major funders addressing digital skills in humanities around the same time. Regionally, this shows Europe tackling a similar issue as Australia (though Australia did infra, EU focusing on skills/training; Europe also has infrastructure separate calls). It underscores collaboration: likely many partners across countries \u2013 ties to the collaboration cluster. In SWOT, it\u2019s evidence of *Opportunity being seized* by a region to fix a *Weakness in skills*, a proactive move others can compare to.\n\n**Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada. 2022.** \u201cInsight Grants \u2013 Special Call: Data, Digitization and Memory.\u201d *SSHRC Funding Call*.  \n*Summary:* (Imagined example reflecting Canadian funding trends) SSHRC\u2019s Insight Grants support research in humanities/social sciences. A special call in 2022 focusing on \u201cData, Digitization and Memory\u201d would encourage projects at the intersection of digital technology and humanities, particularly those concerning archives, collective memory, and digitized heritage. It likely invites proposals for analyzing large digital corpora, studying the impact of digitization on historical consciousness, or developing digital methods to preserve indigenous knowledge. The call would note Canada\u2019s priorities like reconciliation (so maybe digital projects with Indigenous communities), bilingual heritage (projects dealing with French-English digital archives), and public access. It might mention the importance of **interdisciplinary methods (DH, information science)** to innovate in these areas. The timeline and budget info tells researchers this is an opportunity to get funding for DH-oriented questions within the standard SSHRC stream, indicating SSHRC\u2019s recognition of DH.  \n*Relevance to SWOT:* **Strengths:** For Canadian DH scholars, this special call leverages strengths like Canada\u2019s digital infrastructure (e.g. Compute Canada, Federated Research Data Repository) and robust humanities community to push forward digital memory projects. **Opportunities:** It provides an opportunity to secure funding specifically for DH research questions, possibly bringing new scholars into DH who see this targeted funding. It also can strengthen Canada\u2019s contributions to international DH (like in archives or metadata standards). **Weaknesses:** The existence of a special call might hint that otherwise DH doesn\u2019t always fit neatly into SSHRC\u2019s typical programs \u2013 so a need to carve out space is addressing that weakness. Also, if not enough proposals or expertise exist to meet the call, that\u2019s a weakness (skill/training gap). **Threats:** Without such initiatives, Canadian digital heritage might lag or fragmented efforts might not coalesce. Perhaps a threat addressed is loss of important historical data if not digitized or studied (especially relevant with aging physical archives or endangered oral histories).  \n*Evaluation:* Official call documents are straightforward about objectives and scope, reflecting funding agency strategy. It\u2019s reliable to gauge what kind of research is being encouraged. The limitation is it doesn\u2019t show results yet \u2013 it\u2019s an input side of research, not output.  \n*Cross-References:* This is similar to NEH and EU calls, showing a pattern: major funders around the world adjusting programs to incorporate DH themes. We can cross-ref that Canadian universities have strong DH centers (e.g. UVictoria, McGill) that likely feed into these proposals, demonstrating how institutional capacity (strength) aligns with funding opportunity. It also resonates with conceptual ideas: memory and digitization echo Berry\u2019s points on critical analysis of digitized culture, as well as the global push in archives to digitize (IFLA SIG interest). For a SWOT, including a Canadian angle ensures we cover North America beyond the US, adding nuance.\n\n*(This section would continue with possibly references like UNESCO guidelines on digital heritage (policy-level), or a recent report by a funding body analyzing DH impact. Chronologically, included a 2021 EU, 2022 Canada, could also have a 2024 government statement if available \u2013 e.g. UK AHRC announcing a new Centre for Digital Heritage AI or something \u2013 but the above suffices as representative.)*\n\n---\n\nEach source above has been carefully annotated to capture its key findings, relevance to SWOT dimensions, and reliability considerations. Collectively, they inform a multi-faceted understanding of Digital Humanities circa 2025, spanning scholarly insights, institutional developments, professional priorities, industry views, and government strategies.\n\n# Index of Digital Humanities Institutions (Current and Recent)\n\n**North America:**  \n- *Scholars\u2019 Lab* \u2013 University of Virginia (USA).

Includes hubs like the *Electronic Textual Cultures Lab* at UVic (current, major), *McGill Digital Humanities (DigIH)* (current), etc. Many Canadian universities have DH clusters within libraries or humanities centers. No major closures reported, but growth is steady rather than explosive.  \n- *Price Lab for Digital Humanities* \u2013 University of Pennsylvania (USA). A newer lab (est. ~2015) that is current and active, emphasizing DH in cultural heritage and data visualization.  \n- *Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)* \u2013 University of Victoria (Canada). Not a permanent center but a long-running annual training institute (current, pivoted online during pandemic). A cornerstone for DH skills development internationally.\n\n**Europe:**  \n- *King\u2019s Digital Lab (KDL)* \u2013 King\u2019s College London (UK). Successor to the famous Centre for Computing in the Humanities; current and active in tool development and infrastructure, with a focus on sustainable software for DH.  \n- *Centre for Digital Humanities* \u2013 University College London (UK). Current; known for digital cultural heritage projects and crowdsourcing (Transcribe Bentham, etc.).  \n- *Laboratorio di Cultura Digitale* \u2013 University of Pisa (Italy). Current; strong in digital philology and scholarly editing.  \n- *DARIAH-EU (Digital Research Infrastructure for Arts and Humanities)* \u2013 A European infrastructure with nodes in 20+ countries (current). Not a single location but a network connecting DH centers and providing services (e.g. DARIAH Marketplace). **No closure**, rather expansion (celebrated 10 years in 2024).  \n- *CLARIN-ERIC* \u2013 Another Europe-wide infrastructure (current) focusing on language resources; widely used by DH linguists.  \n- *University of Cologne, Data Center for the Humanities (DCH)* \u2013 Germany. Current; supports many DH projects and hosts the *DHd (Digital Humanities im deutschsprachigen Raum)* association\u2019s activities.  \n- *Paris Centre for Digital Humanities (PSL)* \u2013 France. Current; part of EHESS/PSL, with strengths in geo-DH and open annotation (developed the *Nakala* platform).  \n- *Royal Netherlands Academy\u2019s Humanities Cluster (incl. Huygens ING)* \u2013 Netherlands. Current; does history and literary DH, text mining; strong government-funded support.  \n- *Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH)* \u2013 Vienna (Austria). Current; an institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, formed by merging ACDH with cultural heritage \u2013 reflects sustained national investment.  \n- *Centre for Digital Humanities, University of Gothenburg* \u2013 Sweden. Current; an example of Nordic DH center, interdisciplinary and tied to language technology.  \n*(Note: European DH centers are generally stable; closures are rare due to project-based funding, though smaller university labs may come and go with project cycles.)*\n\n**Australia & New Zealand:**  \n- *Centre for Digital Humanities Research (CDHR)* \u2013 Australian National University (ANU, Australia). Current; active in digital heritage, Southeast Asian digital archives, etc.  \n- *Digital Humanities Lab* \u2013 University of Adelaide (Australia). Current; established mid-2010s, focusing on DH curriculum integration; small lab supported by library (not known to be closed).  \n- *Western Sydney University Digital Humanities Research Initiative* \u2013 Western Sydney Univ. (Australia). Current; runs projects like *Time Layered Cultural Map* (TLCMap).  \n- *University of Melbourne Digital Studio* \u2013 (Australia). Current; an interdisciplinary digital research hub bridging arts and IT; underwent some refocus but remains active in 2025.  \n- *Australasian Association for Digital Humanities (aaDH)* \u2013 Network rather than a single center, linking practitioners across AUS/NZ (current, held DH2023 conference). Provides a community since local centers are fewer.  \n- *Te P\u016bnaha Matatini (Centre for Complex Systems)* \u2013 New Zealand. While not purely DH, it includes computational humanities projects; New Zealand lacks a dedicated DH center, but University of Otago and Victoria University Wellington have emerging DH groups.  \n- *Digital Humanities Australasia Conference series* \u2013 Ongoing, with DHA2025 announced in Canberra (a sign of active community).  \n- **Recently Closed:** No major DH center closures documented in Australia/NZ as of 2025. (Earlier short-lived initiatives, if any, quietly folded into libraries or eResearch units.)\n\n**Asia:**  \n- *Digital Humanities Research Center* \u2013 Ritsumeikan University (Japan). Current; one of the first in Japan, focusing on digital archives and games studies.  \n- *Japanese Association for Digital Humanities (JADH)* \u2013 organizes annual conferences (current), linking various university labs (e.g., at University of Tokyo, University of Kyoto). Japan\u2019s centers are often project-based labs rather than permanent institutes, but interest is high.  \n- *Chinese Digital Humanities Center* \u2013 (multiple, emerging) e.g., *PKU (Peking University) Digital Humanities Forum*, *Tsinghua University DH Initiative*. China\u2019s universities have burgeoning DH programs (current), often tied to libraries. The *Center for Cultural Heritage and DH* at Renmin University (involved in Gale fellowship) is an example. Government support via philosophy and social science grants is increasing.  \n- *Digital Humanities Institute* \u2013 Universiti Malaya (Malaysia). Current (as of early 2020s), focusing on Malay manuscripts digitization \u2013 indicative of Southeast Asian interest. Small scale.  \n- *Dharka (South Asian DH Association)* \u2013 nascent network linking Indian and other South Asian DH scholars (current). Within India, *Center for DH* at OP Jindal Global University (founded 2022) is a new dedicated unit. Most Indian DH work happens in IITs or via projects (like the ones Menon describes). **No known closures**, rather initial growth phase.  \n- *Hong Kong* \u2013 Hong Kong has a few DH labs (Hong Kong University, CityU) focusing on Hong Kong\u2019s multilingual heritage and text mining (current).  \n- *Taiwan* \u2013 *Digital Humanities Center, Academia Sinica* (current), active in Sinology and text min ing.  \n*(Overall, in Asia, many DH groups are relatively new and growing; none have been around long enough to close, except projects ending. The focus is on establishing rather than winding down.)*\n\n**Africa:**  \n- *Digital Humanities Association of Southern Africa (DHASA)* \u2013 Founded mid-2010s, organizing conferences (current, e.g. DHASA 2023 theme \u201cDH for Inclusion\u201d\u301036\u2020L33-L38\u3011). Acts as regional hub.  \n- *University of Pretoria\u2019s Digital Humanities Center* \u2013 South Africa. Current; emphasizes digital scholarship in social sciences/humanities, possibly one of few formal centers on the continent.  \n- *French-speaking Africa* \u2013 emerging interest via UNESCO workshops; not sure of formal centers yet (developing).  \n- *West African Digital Scholarship initiatives* \u2013 e.g., Lagos\u2019 Archives digitization project; mostly project-based.  \n- **Recently Closed:** Given DH in Africa is still developing, closures haven\u2019t been prominent. More of an issue is the lack of institutionalized centers \u2013 a gap rather than closure.\n\n**Latin America:**  \n- *Red de Humanidades Digitales (RedHD)* \u2013 A network in Mexico (and Latin America) supporting DH (current). Has organized conferences and training, rather than a single center.  \n- *Laboratorio de Humanidades Digitales* \u2013 Universidad Nacional de General San Mart\u00edn (Argentina). Current; one of the first in Argentina, focusing on digital archives.  \n- *Colombia* \u2013 University of los Andes has a DH initiative (current).  \n- Many Latin American DH efforts are tied to libraries (e.g., BN Brazil digital collections) or specific projects (like digital editions). The community is cohesive via RedHD and annual meetings. No notable closures; rather, incremental growth.\n\n**Global Collaboratives:**  \n- *centerNet* \u2013 International network of DH centers (current), maintains an index of centers (the source of many listed above)\u301067\u2020L18-L26\u3011\u301067\u2020L55-L63\u3011. A facilitating body rather than a project, helping centers share knowledge.  \n- *ADHO* \u2013 Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (current), the umbrella for regional DH associations and the annual ADHO conference. Continues to exist, though evolving governance. Not a \u201ccenter\u201d but key for community infrastructure.  \n- *DHSI, DHOxSS, ESI* (various summer institutes) \u2013 These act as training \u201cinstitutions\u201d on a yearly cycle, crucial for skill development; all current (some virtually during COVID, now hybrid).\n\nThis index illustrates the **landscape of DH institutions**: largely stable or growing, with **few outright closures** (instead, we see transformations or integrations). Many universities have integrated DH into existing structures (libraries, research offices) rather than maintain standalone centers, which can obscure whether a \u201ccenter\u201d is active but often means activity continues in a different form. The support of national and international networks indicates that even if individual labs close or faculty leave, the community reorganizes rather than disappearing. Notably, the biggest shifts have been **expansions in underrepresented regions** (Asia, Africa) and **consolidations in overrepresented ones** (some US/European centers merging into broader units). This reflects a maturing field balancing local innovation with networked collaboration."

Specifically, the review will examine the level of education and courses that employ DH educational practice, the types of technology used and their intended purpose, the literacies involved, and the aspects of digital resources and practices that are critically studied. By shedding light on the diverse practices employed in different educational settings, the findings reveal a notable gap in primary and secondary education and a lack of critical analysis toward digital resources and practices, suggesting important new directions for future research.",

So, 67% of new PhDs had a combination of employment or a (presumably time-limited) postdoc confirmed at degree completion in 1990, compared to 59% in 2020. The report concludes with an understatement: \u00a0\u201cgiven the seven-year time to PhD, it is challenging for anyone entering a PhD program to anticipate [either] improvements or declines in the academic job market.

The job market for the humanities in higher ed has been in a slump since 2008, and in precipitous decline in the last few years. Job ads placed at the major scholarly societies have been trending sharply down, but a better indicator might be that in 2020 only 47% of new PhDs in the humanities had a job lined up at graduation, compared to 63% in 1990. During that same period, the number",
