            "\n\nYou are an academic researcher preparing a literature review for the Academy of Management. Below are your objectives and instructions. You have been provided with a set of PDFs as your only knowledge base. Use ONLY those PDFs to extract information and citations. Do not reference or cite any work outside the PDFs provided.\n\n \n\nCONTEXT \u2022 The topic is how organisations have pivoted to market their products as AI products to consumers and stakeholders. \u2022 Some articles discuss \u201cmachinewashing,\u201d defined as \u201ca strategy that organisations adopt to engage in misleading behaviour about ethical AI/algorithmic systems by providing or omitting misleading information, and using symbolic actions such as lobbying or preventing stricter regulation.\u201d While the concept includes misleading behaviour, the focus here is on how organisations portray their products as AI-driven rather than on deception components. \u2022 When using information from a PDF, cite the original sources it references if the idea is attributed to them. If the idea is unique to that PDF, cite the PDF itself.\n\n \n\nYOUR TASK Produce a structured and coherent literature review following these guidelines:\n\n \n\nProvide Comprehensive Summaries with Formal In-Text Citations\n\n \n\nSummarise all relevant studies on how organisations pivot to position products as AI products.\n\nUse concise academic language and provide in-text citations in the format (Author et al., Year).\n\nMaintain consistency in citation style, ensuring you cite the PDF or the original cited work within the PDF correctly.\n\nIdentify and Organise Overarching Themes\n\n \n\nAfter summarising, highlight main themes or categories that emerge (e.g., rebranding strategies, stakeholder perceptions, methodological approaches, etc.).\n\nOrganise these themes logically, demonstrating how they relate to each other in the broader context of AI marketing.\n\nSynthesise Sources into a Cohesive Narrative\n\n \n\nIntegrate identified themes and findings into a unified discussion.\n\nShow how studies build upon, refine, or contrast with each other.\n\nDo not individually list every piece of evidence; rather, synthesise them to tell a coherent story about how organisations leverage AI marketing.\n\nMaintain an Academic Tone with Structured Subheadings\n\n \n\nWrite in a formal academic style suitable for publication in the Academy of Management.\n\nUse descriptive subheadings to guide the reader (e.g. \u201c2.1 Conceptual Foundations of AI Branding\u201d), ensuring clear organisation and flow.\n\nUse Only the Provided PDFs for Evidence\n\n \n\nDo not bring in outside research or citations.\n\nAccurately reference the PDFs when citing an idea unique to that PDF.\n\nIf the PDF attributes the idea to another original source, cite the original source.\n\nADDITIONAL CITATION EXAMPLES\n\n\u2022 If a PDF provides a quote or concept originally from a different work (e.g., \u201c(Becker-Olsen & Potucek, 2013)\u201d), cite it exactly as indicated (Becker-Olsen & Potucek, 2013) rather than the PDF itself.\n\n\u2022 If the PDF contains an original idea (e.g., \u201cFurthermore, and going beyond greenwashing, machinewashing may be used for symbolic actions...\u201d), cite the PDF directly (e.g., \u201c(PDF Title, Year)\u201d).\n\n \n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n\n\u2022 Deliver a single literature review document.\n\n\u2022 Structure it with headings and subheadings.\n\n\u2022 Maintain proper in-text citations and a consistent referencing style throughout.\n\n \n\nREMINDER\n\nAdhere strictly to these instructions, and only base your review on the provided PDFs. Compliance with these guidelines is essential.\n\n I will provide one pdf per message for the next 9 messages. Please pause any computation until input is concluded."

AI is increasingly guiding our consumer choices [52], reshaping service by automatizing tasks [28], assisting managers in\nhiring decisions [42], or augmenting clinical decision-making [71].\nIn light of increasingly ubiquitous AI and its profound impact on\nhuman lives, various government institutions, scientific communities, and the general public are engaged in a widespread discourse\non how to ensure trustworthy AI [31, 33, 36, 43] for both low-, and\nhigh-stake scenarios [11].\nTo this end, a large body of work has focused on identifying the\nprinciples that underlie trustworthy AI [36]. They include mitigating bias and unfairness in AI systems [41], explaining the reasoning\nof AI decisions [39], setting up mechanisms to hold AI accountable\n[36], and ensuring user privacy [60]. However, as trust is determined by people\u2019s perception [40, 43], efforts to design trustworthy\nAI are hampered by a lack of understanding of how to communicate\ntrustworthiness to people, for instance, through documentation or\nother transparency affordances [43]. Particularly for end-users1 ,\ntrusting AI can be a challenge, as they lack the necessary expertise\nand knowledge to evaluate the various trustworthiness principles\n(e.g., robustness, privacy, fairness) [4, 37].\nMotivated by these challenges, this work builds on research highlighting the pivotal role of auditability as an enabler of trust in AI\n[7, 65] and its crucial role in creating an \"AI trustworthiness ecosystem\" [2] by ensuring that the principles of trustworthy AI are met.\nAuditing refers to mechanisms that evaluate and ensure compliance\nwith regulations and ethical standards [54]. Various methods have\nbeen proposed to increase AI systems\u2019 transparency and, thereby\nauditability, such as through the use of model documentation or\ninformation about datasets [14, 21]. While AI documentations are\n1 In line with prior work [39, 58, 68], we define end-users in this paper as laypeople\n(i.e., non-experts in data science or machine learning) who may be affected directly or\nindirectly by the outcomes of AI systems.\n\n248\n\n\fFAccT \u201923, June 12\u201315, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA\n\nScharowski et al.\n\nvaluable artifacts to inform audit decisions, they are tailored to regulators and experts and not intended to certify and communicate\nto end-users that an AI has met the auditing criteria.\nFor this reason, our work focuses on communicating the outcomes of auditing processes to end-users, a topic that has received\nlittle attention in previous work. Specifically, we investigate the\nuse of certification labels, which are commonly used in other domains, such as food and energy [10, 16, 62]. Certification labels are\nrelevant in the context of trustworthy AI for three reasons. First,\nthrough the use of simple language, icons, or color-coding, they\nare usually designed to be accessible to various stakeholder groups,\nincluding end-users with limited knowledge and time [24]. Second,\nif reflecting a genuine and credible auditing process, certification labels can communicate the criteria used in an audit, thereby serving\nas a \"trustworthiness cue\" for end-users [44, 57]. Third, labels have\nshown to promote trustworthiness of a product in other domains\n[64] facing similar challenges on how to certify that a product meets\ncertain criteria, such as agricultural standards (e.g., organic foods\n[16]) or low ecological impact (e.g., sustainable hotels [10]). However, end-users\u2019 attitudes toward AI certification labels and their\neffectiveness in communicating the trustworthiness of AI remain\nto be explored.\nWe addressed this gap by conducting a mixed-method study\nwith both interviews (\ud835\udc41 = 12) and a census-representative survey\n(\ud835\udc41 = 302) with end-users. Our results provide evidence that certification labels can effectively communicate AI trustworthiness.\nQualitative findings revealed that end-users have positive attitudes\ntoward AI certification labels and that labels can increase perceived\ntransparency and fairness and are regarded as an opportunity to establish standards for AI systems. Particularly, data-related concerns\nexpressed by end-users, such as privacy and data protection, can\nbe mitigated through the use of certification labels. However, labels\nmay not be able to address all raised concerns, such as model performance, suggesting that they should be considered one promising\nconstituent among others for trustworthy AI. Furthermore, our\nresults provide insights into facilitators and inhibitors for the effective design of certification labels in the context of AI. For example,\nend-users expressed strong preferences for independent audits and\nhighlighted the challenge of communicating subjective criteria such\nas \"fairness,\" whose meaning can be ambiguous.\nQuantitative findings showed that a certification label significantly increases end-users\u2019 trust and willingness to use AI in both\nlow- and high-stake AI scenarios. Nevertheless, end-users reported\na higher preference for certification labels in high-stake scenarios\n(e.g., hiring procedure) than in low-stake scenarios (e.g., price comparison), and the positive effect of a label on trust and willingness to\nuse AI was more pronounced in high-stake scenarios. This suggests\nthat compliance with mandatory requirements for AI in high-stake\nscenarios could be effectively communicated to end-users through\ncertification labels in addition to the proposed voluntary labeling\nfor low-stake AI scenarios [11, 61].\nTo summarize, our study is the first to demonstrate the potential\nof certification labels as a promising approach for communicating\nto end-users that an audit has certified an AI to be trustworthy. We\ncontribute to the trustworthy AI literature by highlighting opportunities and challenges for designing and effectively implementing\ncertification labels.\n\n249\n\n2\n\nAUDITING FOR TRUSTWORTHY AI\n\nA growing body of work recognizes the critical role of algorithmic or AI auditing in enabling the trustworthiness of AI systems\n[2, 37, 65]. Prior work suggests that auditing improves fairness [69],\naccountability [13], and governance [17], among others. These elements are considered to contribute to trust in and acceptance of AI2 .\nMoreover, audits have the ability to expose problematic behavior,\nsuch as algorithmic discrimination, distortion, exploitation, and\nmisjudgment [3]. In safety-critical industries such as aerospace,\nmedicine, and finance, audits are a long-standing practice [13].\nHowever, only recently have researchers recognized that these areas could inform AI auditing and acknowledged the importance of\nconsidering insights from the social sciences, where audits have\nemerged from efforts toward racial equity and social justice [66].\nWhile the importance of AI auditing has been identified, the\ndevelopment of common audit practices, standards, or regulatory\nguidance is ongoing [3, 13] and efforts to create auditing frameworks throughout the AI development life-cycle are still in their\nearly stages [54]. Auditing can be defined as \"an independent evaluation of conformance of software products and processes to applicable regulations, standards, guidelines, plans, specifications, and\nprocedures.\" [29, p. 30]. At least three types of AI auditing can\nbe distinguished, including first-party internal auditing, secondparty audits conducted by contractors, and independent third-party\naudits [13]. However, whether auditing should be conducted by\nindependent third-parties or internally within organizations is a\ntopic of ongoing academic discussion [17, 38, 54], with both approaches having their advantages and drawbacks. Raji et al. argue\nthat external auditing may be constrained by a lack of access to organizations\u2019 internal processes and information that are often subject\nto trade secrets. In contrast, Falco et al. point out that the outcomes\nof internal audits are typically not publicly disclosed and that it\noften remains unclear whether the auditor\u2019s recommendations are\neffectively implemented or not. The question of whether end-users\nprefer internal or external audits remains to be investigated.\nIn addition to defining standards and best practices for AI auditing, it is crucial to consider how the outcomes of audits can be communicated to different stakeholders with varying knowledge and\nneeds [72]. Current research has mainly focused on approaches for\ndocumenting machine learning (ML) models and training datasets.\nThese artifacts play an important role in the AI trustworthiness\necosystem by increasing transparency and allowing auditors and\nregulators to determine whether principles of trustworthy AI (e.g.,\nfairness, robustness, privacy [36]) have been met [37]. For example, \"model cards\" [14, 49] disclose information about a model\u2019s\npurpose and design process, its underlying assumptions, and the\nmodel\u2019s performance characteristics. Similarly, Gebru et al. introduced \"datasheets,\" which summarize the motivation, composition,\ncollection process, and recommended uses for datasets, and Floridi\net al. recommended the use of \"summary datasheets\" and \"external\nscorecards.\" The former is aligned with the goals of \"datasheets\" and\nsynthesizes key information about the AI, including its purpose,\nstatus, and contact information. The latter is conceptually closely\n2 The definition of trust in AI and its operationalization is an ongoing debate [31, 56,\n\n65, 67]. As an extensive theoretical discussion is out of scope of this work, we focus\non trustworthiness, a property of the trustee, rather than on trust as a process that\ncan be affected by numerous contextual and personal factors [8, 9].\n\n\fCertification Labels for Trustworthy AI\n\nFAccT \u201923, June 12\u201315, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA\n\nrelated to \"model cards\" and evaluates the AI system along several\ndimensions to form an overall risk score [18].\nHowever, these documentations are tailored to AI practitioners,\nand regulators [37, 58, 72], rather than end-users affected by AI\ndecisions. Often, end-users have neither the access nor the expertise\nto understand the technical information that AI documentation\nprovides [1]. It is unlikely that end-users can effectively utilize ML\nmodel documentation or data documentation to make informed\njudgments about trusting or using AI [37]. For this reason, endusers depend on auditors and regulators who can use these artifacts\nto verify and ensure the trustworthiness of AI. Yet, it remains an\nopen research question of how to effectively communicate to endusers that an audit has considered an AI trustworthy. End-users\nrequire accessible communication tailored to their specific values\nand concerns [72]. A potentially effective way to provide such\ninformation is through the use of certification labels, which we will\nintroduce in the following.\n\n3\n\nCERTIFICATION LABELS FOR AUDITED AI\n\nLabels are widely used for displaying specific product or service\nattributes to help consumers make more informed decisions. They\nare well-established in various fields, such as agriculture [23], food\n[34], energy [59], and e-commerce [63]. Different kinds of labels\nexist, and various classification systems have been proposed [30,\n61, 62]. For example, in the food industry, \"nutrition labels\" provide\nconsumers with simplified and easily understandable information\nto identify a product\u2019s nutritional content. While this information\ncan also be found in detailed tables on the back of food packing,\nfor many consumers, this information is too complex, revealing\nsimilar challenges end-users face with AI documentation. This\nis where labels can provide information in a clear and accessible\nmanner, utilizing simple language, icons, and color coding, which\nmakes labels accessible to individuals from different backgrounds\n[22, 24]. Prior work in consumer research has shown that labels\ncan communicate the outcomes of audits and thereby enhance trust\nin a product [64].\nIn this study, we focus on certification labels, which certify that\na product or service meets one or several criteria and are thus suitable for the case of audited AI. Certification labels are exclusively\nawarded to products that have undergone an auditing process,\ntypically conducted by a third-party organization [62]. By communicating an institutional assurance of trustworthiness, third-party\norganizations can serve as \"trust surrogates\" for the consumer, shifting the trust relation from trust in the AI to trust in the institution\nthat provides the certification [64]. In this case, a certification label\nserves as a trustworthiness cue [57] that signals compliance with\ngovernance structures. Our work thus closely aligns with the proposal by Liao and Sundar, highlighting that the trustworthiness of\nAI is not inherently given but must be communicated and perceived\nas such by the user, for instance, through transparency affordances.\nAccording to the authors, people then use heuristics (i.e., mental\nrules of thumb) to evaluate these affordance cues to form judgments about the trustworthiness of AI. The authors further suggest\nthat certifications from regulatory bodies that have audited the\nAI could serve as trustworthiness cues, invoking these heuristics.\nTherefore, certification labels in the context of AI are a promising\n\n250\n\napproach to communicate that a regulatory body has audited an AI\nand considered it trustworthy.\nThere have been several initiatives at a national and international level to introduce AI labels in both industry (e.g., [20], [25],\n[19]) and government (e.g., [15], [46]). These initiatives vary in\ntheir intended scope but are mostly still in an early stage. Previous\nstudies have also emphasized the potential of labels as a means of\nAI certification [27, 58, 61]. Holland et al. proposed the concept of a\n\"Data Set Nutrition Label,\" which would summarize key aspects of\na dataset (e.g., metadata and the data source) prior to the development of ML models. Seifert et al. further suggested labels for trained\nML models that independent reviewers have evaluated based on\nproperties such as accuracy, fairness, and transparency. A recent\nstudy by Stuurman and Lachaud commented on various labels to\nprovide information to end-users affected by AI decisions. Drawing\nfrom the EU Act on AI [12], the study distinguished between lowstake and high-stake AI systems and proposed a voluntary labeling\nsystem for AI not considered high-stake. This distinction aligns\nwith recommendations from the EU\u2019s \"white paper on artificial\nintelligence,\" [11] which encourages organizations to use labels to\ndemonstrate the trustworthiness of their AI-based products and\nservices. A survey conducted with individuals and organizations\ndirectly or indirectly engaged in audits found that while respondents believed that AI audits should be mandatory, 53% supported\nmandating them only for high-stakes systems [13]. End-users\u2019 perceptions of certification labels in low and high-stakes AI scenarios\nhave not yet been investigated.\nDespite this extensive theoretical work on labels in the context of\nAI and their gradual adoption in industry and government, there is\ncurrently a lack of empirical research exploring end-users\u2019 attitudes\ntoward AI certification labels and their effectiveness in communicating trustworthiness in low- and high-stake AI scenarios. This\nstudy aims to address this research gap and inform current industry\nand government initiatives.\n\n4\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS\n\nBased on the aforementioned considerations, we investigated the\nfollowing research questions:\nRQ1: What are end-users\u2019 attitudes toward certification labels in\nthe context of AI?\nRQ2: How do certification labels affect end-users\u2019 trust and willingness to use AI in low- and high-stake scenarios?\n\n5\n\nMETHODS\n\nTo answer these research questions, we used a mixed-method research approach consisting of semi-structured interviews and a\nsubsequent survey to collect quantitative data as part of a withinsubjects design study. For both the interviews and the survey, we\nused a scenario-based approach to investigate people\u2019s attitudes and\nthe effects of a certification label, inspired by past research [5, 32, 35].\nIn the interviews, we asked participants about their attitudes toward\nAI and certification labels. As a follow-up within-subjects study,\nwe implemented a survey to investigate the effect of a certification\nlabel quantitatively. The semi-structured interviews served as a\nbasis for the survey and a means to enrich the quantitative results.\nThe quantitative survey complemented the qualitative interviews\n\n\fFAccT \u201923, June 12\u201315, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA\n\nScharowski et al.\n\nby extending our results to a larger census-representative sample.\nIn the following, we will introduce the certification label used in\nour study before describing the procedures of each method in more\ndetail.\n\nnon-conformities are identified, the organization applying for the\nlabel must fix the identified issues, e.g., adjust its privacy policy.\nAfter a successful auditing report, the certification label is awarded\nfor a period of three years with two audits during that period.\n\n5.1\n\n5.2\n\nThe certification label\n\nTo investigate labels in the context of AI, we used a certification\nlabel that has already been developed for the broader context of\ndigital trust. Using an existing label had the advantage that it had\nundergone an extensive design process and thus did not need to be\ncreated from scratch.\n\nScenario selection\n\nParticipants were presented with real-world examples of AI systems, adapted from Kapania et al., namely medical diagnosis, loan\napproval, hiring procedure, music preference, route planning and price\ncomparison (see materials on OSF: https://osf.io/gzp5k/). One advantage of using hypothetical scenarios instead of real consumer\napplications is that differences in participants\u2019 prior experience with\nthe applications can be controlled for Kapania et al. and Woods et al.\nproposed that people\u2019s behavior in scenario-based experiments corresponds to their real-life behavior. To answer our second research\nquestion and following Kapania et al. we explored both low-stake\nscenarios (music preference, route planning, price comparison) and\nhigh-stake scenarios (medical diagnosis, hiring procedure, loan approval). This distinction was crucial since other researchers [18, 61]\nand the \"EU AI Act\" [12] have discussed the use of AI labels for \"lowstake\" and \"high-stake\" scenarios. This classification was based on\nthe AI\u2019s respective impact on affected parties and the involvement\nof significant risks, in particular with respect to safety, consumer\nrights, and the use of personal data.\n\nFigure 1: The \"Digital Trust Label,\" which we adopted as a\ncertification label for AI. \u00a92023 Swiss Digital Initiative\nThe non-profit foundation Swiss Digital Initiative laid the groundwork for developing this certification label. At the label\u2019s core lies a\ncatalog of verifiable and auditable criteria, co-developed by an academic expert group based on a user study on digital trust. A panel of\nindependent experts from academia, data and consumer protection,\nand digital ethics further developed the label catalog. Involving\ndigital service providers and auditors in the designing process ensured that the criteria were auditable and verifiable. The catalog\nthat forms the basis of the audit currently contains 35 criteria that\nare summarized into four categories:\n(1) Security (criteria 1 - 12): What is the security standard? The\nservice provider shall, e.g., ensure that the data is encrypted\nas it transfers so that third-parties cannot access it.\n(2) Data protection (criteria 13 - 20): How is the data protected?\nThe service provider shall, e.g., assume responsibility for the\nappropriate management of the data.\n(3) Reliability (criteria 21 - 29): How reliable is the service or\nproduct? The service provider shall, e.g., take all actions\nrequired to safeguard the continuity of the service.\n(4) Fair user interaction (criteria 30 - 35): Is automated decisionmaking involved? The service provider shall, e.g., ensure\nthat all users receive equal treatment and that there is no\ndata-based service or price discrimination.\nIf an organization would like its digital product or service (e.g., a\nchatbot) to receive the certification label, it can voluntarily request\nan audit and thus participate in the certification process. After a\nscoping call with third-party auditors, an audit is performed along\nthe criteria catalog. The audit leads to an audit report detailing the\nperformance per criterion, which is double-checked by an independent label certification committee composed of auditing experts. If\n\n251\n\n5.3\n\nInterviews\n\n5.3.1 Participants. Initially, we invited 16 participants to an interview on-site at the university. The recruitment was carried out\nthrough a university-internal database and an online marketplace\nwhere scientific studies can be advertised. To ensure that our sample\nconsisted of end-users (i.e., laypeople who may be affected directly\nor indirectly by the outcomes of AI systems), we used screening\nquestions following Kapania et al. and asked potential participants\nabout their knowledge of AI and experience working with AI-based\nsystems. We selected participants who indicated that they have\nheard about AI but did not work with it and provided a comprehensible description or adequate example of what AI is without overly\nrestricting the valid responses (e.g., \"robots\" was valid while obvious nonsense answers such as \"E.T. the alien\" was deemed invalid).\nIn addition, we asked participants to indicate their age, gender,\nprofession, and English language proficiency so that we could design the interviews as balanced as possible and present materials\nin English. However, four interviews did not take place due to noshows. We, therefore, conducted 12 interviews with end-users of\ndifferent backgrounds, ages, and genders that lasted 60 - 90 minutes.\nThe interviews were conducted in German and recorded through\nfield notes and audio recordings. Each participant received compensation in the form of a gift card worth CHF 10.00 from a Swiss\nretail company. The final sample (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = 35.42, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = 12.50,\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = 23, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = 66) consisted of students (P2, P3, P4, P8,\nP11) enrolled in linguistics and literature (P2), fine arts (P3), and\npsychology (P4, P8, P11), as well as individuals who described their\noccupation as a bike messenger (P12), waitress (P1), dancer (P9),\ncourse manager (P7), management assistant (P6), intern (P10) and\nretired teacher (P5). The sample was predominantly female, with\nten women and two men.\n\n\fCertification Labels for Trustworthy AI\n\nFAccT \u201923, June 12\u201315, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA\n\n5.3.2 Procedure. Before the interviews, participants had to read\nand sign a declaration of consent. In the declaration, we informed\nparticipants of the purpose and rationale of the study, the researcher\naffiliations, the voluntary nature of study participation, and how\ntheir data will be analyzed and shared. All personally identifiable\ninformation was deleted to ensure privacy, and the anonymous\ndata was stored without actual reference to the participants.\nDuring the interviews, we asked attitudinal questions about AI,\nspecifically where participants saw opportunities and challenges\nin using AI. We then presented the six scenarios to the participants without specifying the low- and high-stake categorization\nwe had made in advance. Based on the respective headings of the\nscenarios (e.g., music preference), without further information, we\nasked participants to order the scenarios via drag and drop from\n\"most impactful\" (rank 1) to \"least impactful\" (rank 6). To ensure\ncomparability, we defined \"most impactful\" for participants as \"the\nscenario that would have the greatest impact on your personal life.\"\nThis question aimed to validate our categorization in low- and highstake scenarios. Next, we presented participants with one low-stake\nand one high-stake scenario and asked how they differed from one\nanother. After this, participants were introduced to the certification\nlabel and asked how they perceived it, whether the label criteria\nwere comprehensible or not, and where they saw opportunities\nand drawbacks of a certification label. The goal of the interviews\nwas not only to gather qualitative data, but also to identify and\ndetermine which questions best suited the subsequent survey. We,\ntherefore, made sure the questions were comprehensible and free\nof ambiguities. Any difficulties encountered during the interviews\nwere discussed within the research team, and, if necessary, the respective questions were revised or removed. We refer to the digital\nrepository for the complete interview manual.\n\n5.4\n\nSurvey\n\n5.4.1 Participants. To gain insights into how a general population\nperceives a label in the context of AI, we hired a market research\nagency (https://www.bilendi.ch/) to provide us with a Swiss censusrepresentative sample regarding age and gender (quota sampling).\nWe used the same screening questions as in the interviews and\ninitially recruited 395 participants that received CHF 3.00 for taking\npart in the 15-minute online survey. Following a quality assessment using a self-reported single item as an indicator of careless\nresponding [6, 48], 302 participants remained for data analysis.\nThe sample is census-representative regarding age (\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = 43.88,\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = 16.08, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = 18, \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 = 79) and the gender distribution (150 women, 151 men, one non-binary person).\n5.4.2 Procedure and measures. The survey consisted of three parts.\nFirst, after providing informed consent and a brief introduction to\nthe study, participants were free to select one scenario from the\nlow-stake and one from the high-stake categorization. After making\ntheir choice, they received full descriptions of the two scenarios (see\nAppendix A) and were asked to rate their trust (\"how much would\nyou trust the AI in the scenario presented?\") and willingness to\nuse (\"how much would you be willing to use the AI in the scenario\npresented?\") on a scale from 0 (= not at all) to 100 (= absolutely).\nIn addition, participants were asked in which scenario they would\nmore readily accept the AI\u2019s decision/recommendation (i.e., \"in\n\n252\n\nwhich of the two scenarios would you be more willing to accept\nthe decision/recommendation made by AI?\").\nParticipants were introduced to the certification label in the\nsecond part of the survey. They were asked for their impression\nand rated the importance of each criterion (i.e., \"how important are\nthe label criteria for you in the context of AI?\") on a scale from 0 (=\nnot at all) to 100 (= absolutely). Participants were also asked what\neffect the certification label had on their acceptance (i.e., \"would\nyou be more likely to accept an AI\u2019s decision/recommendation if\nit had received a label?\") and preference (i.e., \"in which one of the\ntwo scenarios would you prefer the use of a label?\"). To understand\nend-users\u2019 preferences regarding external and internal auditing, we\nincluded an open-ended question (i.e., \"who do you think should\nbe responsible for awarding such a label?\").\nFinally, in the fourth part, we again let participants rate the AI in\nthe same low- and high-stake scenario on trust and willingness to\nuse, this time with the information that the AI had been awarded\na certification label. This second assessment allowed us to examine the certification label\u2019s effect on trust and willingness to use\nratings. Similarly to the first assessment, we asked participants to\njustify their ratings and why a label led to increased/decreased or\nunchanged ratings. At the end of the survey, we asked the participants for feedback and the question, \"in your honest opinion, should\nwe use your data in our analyses in this study? Do not worry, this\nwill not affect your payment. You will receive the compensation either\nway,\" as an additional quality check. The complete survey can be\nfound on the digital repository.\n\n5.5\n\nAnalysis and coding procedure\n\nWe used the qualitative interview data to answer RQ1 and the\nquantitative survey data to answer RQ2. The interview data was\nevaluated using qualitative content analysis [47], more specifically\nsummarizing content analysis. We followed the procedure according to Mayring and Fenzl by determining the coding unit, paraphrasing, generalization to the level of abstraction, first reduction, and\nsecond reduction to form a cross-case category system. Coding was\ncarried out by three researchers who independently went through\nfour interviews each. To ensure consistency, one interview was\nevaluated by all researchers. Any ambiguities and discrepancies\nwere resolved through open discussions, and the final cross-case\ncategory system was formed in a group session. The quantitative\ndata analysis was carried out in R (version 4.2.2. [53]). We used the\nggstatsplot package (version 0.9.1. [51]) to conduct statistical testing\nand report \ud835\udc61-values, standard deviations, and the corresponding\n\ud835\udc5d-values. We set the level of statistical significance to \ud835\udefc = .05.\n\n6 RESULTS\n6.1 Attitudes toward certification labels\nThe content analysis of the interview data resulted in 127 casespecific categories, which were further consolidated across participants into 25 categories. These cross-categories were grouped\ninto the following topics: \"AI-related concerns, risks, problems,\", \"AIrelated opportunities, advantages,\", \"attitudes toward certification\nlabels,\", and perceived \"differences between low- and high-stakes\nscenarios\". For the purpose of this study, we focus on the topic\n\"attitudes toward certification labels,\" as this was the most relevant\n\n\fFAccT \u201923, June 12\u201315, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA\n\nScharowski et al.\n\nTable 1: End-users\u2019 attitudes toward certification labels\nCategory\nOpportunities for\ncertification labels\n\nSubcategory\nIncreasing trust\nIncreasing perceived\ntransparency\nIncreasing perceived\nfairness\nAuditing of AI systems\n\nFacilitators for effective\ncertification labels\n\nEstablishing standards\nfor AI systems\nCovering relevant\nconcerns\nAdditional label\ninformation\nIndependent party\nawarding the label\nRecognition of label\nClarity of label criteria\n\nLimitations of\ncertification labels\n\nActuality of label\nUnaddressed concerns\nLack of persuasiveness\n\nInhibitors for effective\ncertification labels\n\nOverabundance of labels\n\nVacuousness of label\ncriteria\nSubjectivity of label\ncriteria\nOverlaps of label criteria\n\nExample quote\n\"Because if it is monitored and these various criteria have to be met in order to get the label,\nthen I as a consumer can, of course, trust better and also know that there are perhaps controls\nand random checks, so I would definitely trust more.\" (P6)\n\"I think that if there is such an established label, it will certainly help to increase transparency.\"\n(P6)\n\"With the Fair User Interaction aspect, yes, probably so [fairness is increased]. . . . if the AI is\nnow checked for this, and it can be determined that it is not data-based, treated differently.\"\n(P12)\n\"Because I\u2019m not an expert in the field and the label . . . , gives me proof . . . that it\u2019s tested by\nexperts.\" (P4)\n\"So I could imagine that if it is a bit more standardized, so to speak, because you have to meet\ncertain standards, that it could introduce a general level of fairness.\" (P3)\n\"The concern [responsibility] was covered and then just the general concern with all just how\nour data is also used and hopefully not misused, or yes. That is also covered.\" (P10)\n\"[I would like to] find out what this \"Fair User Interaction\" means, what it refers to, how my\ndata is protected . . . how is it designed and who monitors this label. Exactly by whom was it\ncreated and by whom it is administered, awarded and so on, that\u2019s what I would like to know.\"\n(P12)\n\"Ideally, it would be an overarching body that is, for example, also external and has the\ncompetences and the knowledge . . . ideally, an NGO that runs it without any vested interest.\"\n(P12)\n\"If many companies get involved in using this label. Then I think it could have an impact.\" (P9)\n\"[The criteria] are totally comprehensible to me, in any case. It\u2019s also something that would be\nimportant to me if I were to use such a program.\" (P9)\n\"You could say that the label guarantees that work on AI is ongoing.\" (P11)\n\"What you could include is a criterion for the AI. That an AI has been used enough times and\nhas, for example, been 99% correct and always had the right answers, rather than 80%.\" (P4)\n\"I think there are still a lot of people, or some people, who will be critical of these systems even\nthough it has a label.\" (P3)\n\"Because you can see that in the organic sector, there are now 20 labels and as a consumer\nyou can almost no longer categorize them, so I think it\u2019s so important now that there is also\nBio-Suisse [an organic label] or something like that in Switzerland, they have established\nthemselves well, but I think you always have to stick to that as a label.\" (P6)\n\"I find these four points are so common. And bad news is, maybe we don\u2019t really analyze what\nis written. Or don\u2019t even read. I can\u2019t speak of everyone, but speaking of myself. I often just\ndon\u2019t read that message. Beautiful words, but all blah blah blah.\" (P2)\n\"Yes, so what is complete transparency? That brings us back to fairness . . . what is fair? These\nare all such subjective terms that, in my eyes, you can\u2019t use like in natural sciences - where you\ncalculate and then there\u2019s a result - it\u2019s soft science where you\u2019re working in.\" (P5)\n\"Overlap; I think it all goes a bit in a similar direction, except maybe the last point [Fair User\nInteraction], which is a bit different again.\" (P10)\n\nto our current research objective. Categories may consist of further\nsubcategories. Table 1 contains the subcategories and corresponding example quotes from end-users\u2019 attitudes toward certification\nlabels. The complete content analysis with all topics is available on\nthe digital repository.\n6.1.1 Opportunities and facilitators. Participants in the interview\nstudy indicated that the label covered essential concerns. The content analysis revealed that the topic \"concerns, risks, and problems\" predominantly consisted of data-related concerns such as\ndata privacy (i.e., protecting data from attack and malicious use),\ndata storage (i.e., how data is handled and stored), and third-party\ninvolvement (i.e., unwanted and unknown disclosure of data). Regarding data-related concerns, a certification label for AI systems\nwas perceived as an effective tool to convey compliance with these\nrequirements and hold the certified parties more accountable. In\nparticular, the security and data protection criteria were perceived\nas minimal standards that must be met for them to consider using AI.\nParticipants emphasized that a certification label provides a certain\nlevel of transparency that removes the burden of examining these\n\n253\n\ncriteria from end-users. In addition, they viewed the certification\nlabels and corresponding auditing process as an opportunity for\nmore fairness and to establish standards for AI systems, allowing\nthem to compare products and services critically. The interviewed\nparticipants indicated that a certification label could increase their\ntrust for all these reasons.\nFor a label to be convincing, participants emphasized that additional information regarding the label is needed. This includes\ninformation about the label\u2019s criteria (i.e., how were they formed?),\nthe auditing process itself (i.e., how were these criteria weighted?),\nand the auditors (i.e., who was responsible for awarding a label?).\nParticipants also placed a strong emphasis on the independence\nof the auditing process, noting that the auditors should have no\nfinancial ties to or other direct dependencies on the organizations\nfor whose products or services the label is awarded in order not\nto undermine their credibility. Additionally, participants stressed\nthe importance of widespread participation in the auditing and\ncertification process, as this was deemed necessary for adopting\nAI standards and the label\u2019s credibility. As a crucial factor for the\n\n\fCertification Labels for Trustworthy AI\n\nFAccT \u201923, June 12\u201315, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA\n\neffectiveness of a certification label, participants identified regular\nupdates that align with industry standards and best practices to\nensure that the label remains relevant and useful.\n6.1.2 Limitations and inhibitors. While participants acknowledged\nthat a certification label covers essential issues, they also noted that\nit does not address all their AI-related concerns. These concerns\nincluded the lack of model performance (e.g., accuracy measures).\nSome participants noted that a certification label alone could even\nlead to \"blind trust\" in AI systems without accuracy measures. Additionally, participants noted that while a certification label provides\nsome level of transparency, it does not provide complete documentation (e.g., source code) of the AI system and the ethical reasoning\nbehind the auditors\u2019 decision to approve the use of AI in a particular application in the first place. As a result of these limitations,\nparticipants felt that a certification label might not be sufficiently\npersuasive to convey trustworthiness for critical individuals.\nFurthermore, participants identified several reasons why a certification label may not be effective. One reason was a potential\noverabundance of labels with different standards, diluting compliance with regulations and leading to confusion among end-users. In\nline with this, participants emphasized the importance of ensuring\nthat the label\u2019s criteria are not just \"empty promises\" but that they\nare actually adhered to by organizations. They also pointed out\nthe difficulty of measuring the label\u2019s criteria and the degree of\nsubjectivity involved. Concepts such as security and fairness can\nmean different things to different people. Results showed that some\ncriteria were more easily understood (e.g., security) than others\n(e.g., fair user interaction). For example, 11/12 participants implied\nthat the definition of the security criteria covered what they had in\nmind. For data protection, this was the case for 9/12 participants,\nfollowed by 8/12 participants for reliability. However, merely 2/12\nparticipants indicated that the criterion \"fair user interaction\" captured what they thought it would encompass. In addition to these\ndifferences in comprehension, participants pointed out conceptual\noverlaps for some criteria (e.g., security and data protection) that\nwere not readily understood without further clarification. All these\nfactors might diminish the effectiveness of a certification label.\n\n6.2\n\nEffects of certification labels\n\nParticipants in the survey study were asked to select one case\neach from the high-stake (medical diagnosis, hiring procedure, loan\napproval) and one from the low-stake (music preference, route planning, price comparison) scenarios without explicitly being informed\nof this distinction. Validation of this distinction between low- and\nhigh-stake was provided by participants\u2019 \"impactfulness\" rankings.\nCalculating a mode revealed that the three high-stake scenarios\nwere perceived as the most impactful ones (i.e., 1 = medical diagnosis, 2 = hiring process, 3 = loan approval, 4 = price comparison, 5 =\nmusic preference, 6 = route planning). The majority of participants\nindicated that they would be more likely to accept the AI\u2019s decision/recommendation in low-risk scenarios (74.2%, \ud835\udc5b = 224) than\nin high-risk scenarios (17.9%, \ud835\udc5b = 54) and 7.9% (\ud835\udc5b = 24) indicating\nno preference, which we considered an additional confirmation of\nthe distinctiveness of the two scenarios. Participants in the interview study distinguished between low- and high-stakes scenarios\nprimarily on the level of risk associated with the scenario. They\n\n254\n\nreported that high-stakes scenarios carry higher self-relevance and\nlong-term consequences.\nBefore being presented with the certification label, participants\nreported both higher trust (\ud835\udc40 = 66.72, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 24.27) and willingness\nto use (\ud835\udc40 = 71.54, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 25.54) ratings for the low-stake scenarios,\ncompared to ratings in high-stake scenarios for trust (\ud835\udc40 = 49.37,\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 30.76) and willingness to use (\ud835\udc40 = 52.89, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 32.63). After\nbeing presented with the certification label, participants\u2019 trust and\nwillingness to use ratings revealed statistically significant increases\nin both low- and high-stakes scenarios (see Figure 2). A dependent\nStudent\u2019s \ud835\udc61-test indicated that the presence of a certification label\nresulted in the highest increase for trust (\ud835\udc40\u0394 = 9.12, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 17.92,\n\ud835\udc61 (301) = 8.84, \ud835\udc5d < .001) and willingness to use (\ud835\udc40\u0394 = 8.41, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 =\n17.69, \ud835\udc61 (301) = 8.26, \ud835\udc5d < .001) ratings in high-stake scenarios,\nfollowed by trust (\ud835\udc40\u0394 = 6.57, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 13.26, \ud835\udc61 (301) = 8.61, \ud835\udc5d < .001)\nand willingness to use (\ud835\udc40\u0394 = 4.60, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 17.03, \ud835\udc61 (301) = 4.70,\n\ud835\udc5d < .001) ratings in low-stake scenarios. Hedges\u2019 \ud835\udc54 for effect sizes\nranged between .27 - .51 and can thus be considered small (for\nlow-stake scenarios) to medium (for high-stake scenarios) [55].\nThe different ratings depending on low- and high-stake scenarios\nbecome evident when considering the violin plots and boxplots\n(see Figure 2). The ratings for high-stake scenarios are relatively\nsymmetrically distributed across the scale. In contrast, the low-stake\nscenarios\u2019 distribution is heavily left-skewed, with approximately\n75% of the data above a rating of 50 for trust and willingness to\nuse. Introducing a certification label for both scenarios leads to\na further shift of the distribution to the right and, thus, higher\nratings. Plotting the non-aggregated scenarios individually reveals\nthe distributional differences more clearly (see Figure 3). The ratings\nof the individual high-stakes scenarios are more spread out on the\nscale than in the case of the low-stake scenarios. Differences in the\neffectiveness of a label also become apparent from this perspective.\nThe median trust and willingness to use ratings in all scenarios\nincreases in the presence of a label and are more pronounced in the\nhigh-stake scenarios.\nA majority of the survey participants directly indicated that they\nwould prefer the use of a certification label in the selected highstake scenario (63.2%, \ud835\udc5b = 191), compared to preferring a label in the\nlow-stake scenarios (22.2%, \ud835\udc5b = 67), with 14.6% (\ud835\udc5b = 44) of participants indicating no preference. Regarding the different preferences\nfor certification labels in low- and high-stake scenarios, participants\nfrom the interview study expressed a greater demand for a certification label in high-stake scenarios because of the higher scenario\ncomplexity, limited individual expertise, and a lack of prior experience with the system. Overall, 81.1% (\ud835\udc5b = 245) of survey participants\nstated a preference for using an AI with a label, compared to 6%\n(\ud835\udc5b = 18) that would prefer to use an AI without a label and 12.9%\n(\ud835\udc5b = 39) that stated no preference. Also, 70.9% (\ud835\udc5b = 214) indicated\nto be more likely to accept an AI\u2019s decision/recommendation if it\nhad received a label, compared to 14.2% (\ud835\udc5b = 43) that indicated \"no,\"\nand 14.9% (\ud835\udc5b = 45), that made no statement. Survey participants\nrated the importance of the existing label criteria in the context\nof AI at a high level with similar ratings for security (\ud835\udc40 = 87.72,\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 20.93), data protection (\ud835\udc40 = 85.04, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 21.81), reliability\n(\ud835\udc40 = 76.97, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 23.19) and fair user interaction (\ud835\udc40 = 80.80,\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37 = 23.37).

Based on these findings, we argue that parallel to voluntary\nlabeling for low-stake AI scenarios, compliance with mandatory\nrequirements for AI in high-stake scenarios could also be communicated through certification labels, potentially increasing end-users\u2019\ntrust in and willingness to use awarded AI systems.\nQualitative findings allowed us to answer our first research question and provide a more nuanced picture of which aspects to consider for effective certification labels in the context of AI. The\ncertification label we investigated in this study was designed for\ndigital trust more generally. However, end-users\u2019 attitudes toward\nthe certification label were primarily positive, and the label\u2019s criteria of security, data protection, reliability, and fair user interaction\nwere also relevant to end-users in the context of AI. We derive this\nfrom survey participants\u2019 high \"importance\" ratings for the existing\nlabel criteria. Concerning opportunities for AI labels, participants\nin the interview study indicated that a certification label could increase perceived transparency and fairness and serve as a means\nto establish standards for AI systems. It became apparent from the\ninterviews that certification labels can especially cover end-users\u2019\ndata-related concerns (e.g., privacy, data protection, and third-party\ninvolvement) that map to previous work [65].\nHowever, our results also reveal that certification labels have\nlimitations and do not alleviate all issues end-users face regarding the use of AI. Only half of the participants in the survey indicated that a certification label addresses their AI-related concerns/challenges/risks, suggesting that end-users seem to hold\ndifferentiated needs. For example, participants in our interviews\npointed out that a certification label does not provide indicators\nabout the AI\u2019s performance (e.g., accuracy measures). They remarked that performance indicators are essential in deciding in\n\n256\n\nwhich cases the AI can be trusted and when it must be questioned.\nThis led participants to remark that a label could inadvertently\nfoster \"blind trust\" if performance indicators are absent. Thus, we\nsuggest that certification labels should either include performance\nindicators as part of the label criteria or be supplemented with them.\nBased on these results, we argue that certification labels can more\nreadily signal trustworthiness than untrustworthiness. This is because it is not possible to distinguish if a digital product or service\nhas not yet been audited or whether it has failed to meet specific\naudit criteria, particularly if certification labels remain voluntary.\nWe regard certification labels as one component of an \"AI trustworthiness ecosystem\" [2] that meets essential needs for end-users\nbut which ideally should be combined with other transparency\napproaches to signal untrustworthiness (e.g., accuracy measures)\nand form a \"chain of trust\" [65].\nAs potential inhibitors for effective certification labels, participants in our interviews pointed out certain overlaps and the subjective nature of the label\u2019s criteria. Ultimately, \"fairness\" and \"security\"\nare subjective judgments that vary from one person to the next, and\nour results showed that the criterion \"fair user interaction,\" in particular, did not reflect what study participants thought it encompassed.\nThe challenge for auditing of defining and measuring concepts that\nare inherently difficult to quantify has been discussed by previous\nresearch [37, 58, 66]. Our results indicate that this subjectivity is\nrecognized by end-users and can impair the effectiveness of a label.\nTo avoid a discrepancy between, for example, the auditors\u2019 definition of fairness and what people commonly associate with this term,\nauditors should be in dialogue with end-users so that their values\nare represented in a label. This is in line with Costanza-Chock et al.,\nwho had criticized that the involvement of affected communities\nplays a minor role in AI audits. They argued that real-world harms\nand sociological phenomena could only be understood by engaging\nwith people to inform auditing.\n\n\fFAccT \u201923, June 12\u201315, 2023, Chicago, IL, USA\n\nScharowski et al.\n\nOur interview results highlight that end-users request not only\ninformation on the label\u2019s criteria but also information regarding\nthe criteria content (i.e., how they were formed), the auditing process itself (i.e., how the criteria informed the audit), and particularly\nabout the auditors (i.e., who awarded the label). We identified this\ndemand for additional information as a potential facilitator, indicating that an effective certification label is more than just a list of\nevaluation criteria. A large majority (86%) of survey participants\nresponded that either the government (49%) or a non-governmental\norganization (37%) should ideally be responsible for awarding a\nlabel, with only 5.3% of responses indicating that a company should\nbe responsible. Participants in the interview study emphasized the\nauditors\u2019 independence (e.g., financially, with no conflict of interest)\nas a prerequisite for the effectiveness of a certification label. These\nfindings support the notion that auditing can only foster trust if the\nauditors themselves are trusted [2] and are in line with results of\nlabel studies in other domains [23, 64], which show that third-party\ncertification positively affects trust in eco-labels. We contribute to\nthe ongoing discussion regarding internal vs. external auditing by\nshowing that end-users favor independent auditors. To account for\nthis independence on the one hand and the structural advantages of\ninternal audits on the other, \"cooperative audits\" [69] could be a way\nforward, balancing between the advantages and challenges of the\ntwo approaches. In addition to these facilitators and inhibitors, auditors and regulators should also be mindful that an overabundance\nof labels with different standards can inhibit the persuasiveness\nand trustworthiness of their certification label. Such effects have\nbeen reported for eco-labels, where an extensive number of existing labels result in different standards that remain unclear to\nconsumers [26]. These findings speak for a certain harmonization\nand regulation of certification labels. Moreover, organizational compliance with a label\u2019s criteria should be established so end-users do\nnot perceive them as \"empty promises\" but instead as a means for\nincreased accountability for organizations and more trustworthy\nAI [37]. A prominent instance of such a challenge is the case of\nthe CE (conformit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne) marking, in which some products\nuse the mark without actually being manufactured to EU quality\nstandards [45]. This illegitimate use has led, among other things,\nto the introduction of supplementary certification labels to certify\nproduct quality, which unintentionally contribute to consumer confusion [61]. To realize their full potential, certification labels should\nhave a thorough auditing process, be regularly updated to reflect\ncurrent industry standards, and ideally, be used by a wide range of\norganizations to increase recognition.\n\n8\n\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nWe conducted a within-subjects survey study where participants\nwere presented with the AI scenarios with and without a certification label. While this provided valuable insights into the general\neffectiveness of certification labels, future work could compare label\nclasses or designs (e.g., nutrition labels vs. certification labels) in\na between-subjects experimental design. Certification labels are\nlimited in their ability to communicate untrustworthiness. While\nother kinds of labels have a more differentiated rating system (e.g.,\ncolor-codings or grades) that allows comparisons, certification labels only provide dichotomous information by either being present\n\n257\n\nor not. Thus, it is not possible to differentiate if a product without\na certification label is untrustworthy because it failed to meet a\nlabel\u2019s criteria or has yet to be audited. A between-subjects design\ncould provide evidence about the effectiveness of different kinds of\nlabels and identify the factors that make labels more or less effective\nin communicating trustworthiness and untrustworthiness.\nMoreover, we used single-item questions to measure trust and\nwillingness to use. Trust, in particular, is a complex psychological\nconstruct [56] and might not be adequately operationalized using\nsingle-items measures. However, a recent study has shown that\nsingle-item trust measures are equivalent to validated questionnaires regarding sensitivity to changes in trust and a reliable tool in\nlonger surveys where questionnaires are not feasible [50]. Future\nwork should confirm the effectiveness of certification labels in fostering trust with validated psychometric measures and explore their\neffect on trusting dynamics that emerge over time in real-world\nhuman-AI interactions.\n\n9\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis study empirically investigated certification labels to communicate trustworthy AI to end-users. For this purpose, we explored\nend-users\u2019 attitudes toward certification labels in the context of AI\nand how labels affect trust and willingness to use AI in both lowand high-stakes scenarios. We used a mixed-methods approach to\ncollect both qualitative and quantitative data through interviews\n(\ud835\udc41 = 12) and a census-representative survey (\ud835\udc41 = 302) with endusers. The quantitative results of this study show that certification\nlabels can be a promising way to communicate the outcome of audits to end-users, increasing both trust and willingness to use AI in\nlow- and high-stake AI scenarios. Based on the qualitative findings,\nwe further identified opportunities and limitations of certification\nlabels, as well as inhibitors and facilitators for the effective design\nand implementation of certification labels. Our work provides the\nfirst empirical evidence that labels may be a promising constituent\nin the more extensive \"trustworthiness ecosystem\" for AI.\n\n10\n\nFUNDING, DECLARATION OF\nCONFLICTING INTERESTS AND DATA\nAVAILABILITY\n\nThis research was primarily funded by an independent research\ngroup, but additional funding (CHF 2,500.00) was granted by the\nSwiss Digital Initiative, an independent non-profit foundation, to obtain a representative sample.

Consider the situation where you are\nsearching for potential medical diagnoses. Your insurance is using\nan AI system called MyHealth for evaluating medical symptoms.\nYou will be required to fill out a form, uploading your medical\nhistory, and submit them along with personal information like\nage, gender, marital status and employment status to MyHealth.\nOnce assessed, MyHealth will determine based on the provided\ninformation what your medical diagnosis is.\nA.1.2 Hiring Procedure. Consider the situation where you are applying for a new job at a company. The company is using an AI\nsystem called MyJob for evaluating job applications. You will be\nrequired to fill out a form, uploading your CV, and submit them\nalong with personal information like address, marital status, employment status and references to MyJob. Once assessed, MyJob\nwill determine based on the provided information whether or not\nyou will be invited for an interview.\nA.1.3 Loan Approval. Consider the situation where you are applying for a loan at a bank. The bank is using an AI system called\nMyLoans for evaluating loan applications. You will be required\nto fill out a form, specifying the loan amount, and submit them\nalong with personal information like marital status, employment\n\n260\n\nstatus, annual income and financial history to MyLoans. Once assessed, MyLoans will determine based on the provided information\nwhether your loan application is successful or not.\n\nA.2\n\nLow-stake Scenarios\n\nA.2.1 Music Preference. Consider the situation where you want to\nexplore new music. You are using an AI system called MyMusik for\nevaluating your music preference.

Therefore, this study explores the impact of inclusion (vs.\nexclusion) of the \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d term in goods and service descrip\u00ad\ntions on consumers\u2019 purchase intentions. It also examines the mediating\nrole of emotional trust and the moderating role of perceived product risk\nin this relationship. We conducted six experiments to investigate these\nrelationships. The data were analyzed using T-tests and Hayes Process\nMacro Models 4 and 7. The findings of the study indicated that the\ninclusion of the \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d term in descriptions of products\nand services decreases purchase intention, and that emotional trust\nmediates this relationship. Findings further suggested that the negative\nmediating effect of emotional trust on the impact of AI term on purchase\nintention was stronger for high-risk products, compared to low-risk pro\u00ad\nducts. These findings provide valuable insights for both academia and\npractitioners, leading them to develop more effective and appealing\nstrategies in the applications of AI.\n\nAI; Artificial Intelligence;\nemotional trust; purchase\nintention; perceived risk\n\n\u6458\u8981\n\n\u867d\u7136\u201c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u201d\u4e00\u8bcd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4ea7\u54c1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u8be5\u4ea7\u54c1\u5177\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\n\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u6807\u5fd7,\u4f46\u5b83\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u6050\u60e7\u548c\u62c5\u5fe7. \u56e0\u6b64,\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\n\u4e86\u5546\u54c1\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u201c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u201d\u4e00\u8bcd\u7684\u5305\u542b(\u4e0e\u6392\u9664)\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\n\u613f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd. \u5b83\u8fd8\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u4ea7\u54c1\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\n\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528. \u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb. \u4f7f\u7528T\u68c0\n\u9a8c\u548cHayes\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b8f\u89c2\u6a21\u578b4\u548c7\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790. \u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u5728\u4ea7\u54c1\n\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u201c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u201d\u4e00\u8bcd\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u613f,\u800c\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f1a\n\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb. \u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e,\u4e0e\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u4ea7\u54c1\u76f8\u6bd4,\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4ea7\u54c1\n\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u4efb\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u672f\u8bed\u5bf9\u8d2d\u4e70\u610f\u613f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4f5c\u7528\u66f4\u5f3a.\n\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u89c1\u89e3,\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\n\u80fd\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u7b56\u7565.\n\nCONTACT Dogan Gursoy\ndgursoy@wsu.edu\nSchool of Hospitality Business Management, Carson College of\nBusiness, Washington State University, TODD Hall 0340G, 300 NE College Avenue, Pullman 99163\n\u00a9 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC\n\n\f2\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\nIntroduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) technology has been around for a long time; running in the\nbackground, and empowering many of the technologies we have been using such as\nsmartphones, computers, vehicles, etc (Gursoy & Cai, 2024). Even though AI algo\u00ad\nrithms have already been integrated into smart devices such as mobile phones, tablets,\ncomputers, navigation, security, health, social media, etc., AI has been viewed as\na futuristic technology by most consumers until recently (Y. Huang & Gursoy,\n2024). With the recent introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Google\nGemini and Microsoft Copilot, AI technologies have started gaining significant atten\u00ad\ntion from consumers (Gursoy et al., 2023; Gursoy & Cai, 2024). While many con\u00ad\nsumers view the growing use of AI technologies as a positive advancement, it causes\nfear and anxiety among others (Dorotic et al., 2024; Inman et al., 2024; Kopalle et al.,\n2022). Since AI technology is a relatively new and unknown concept for most con\u00ad\nsumers, they may exhibit both positive and negative attitudes and behaviors toward AI\n(Bozkurt & Gursoy, 2023).\nWhile there is generally a positive outlook on AI\u2019s impact on customer experience, such\nas improvements in efficiency, convenience, and personalization, growing evidence high\u00ad\nlights consumers\u2019 concerns about integrating AI technology into products and services\n(Dencheva, 2023; Haan, 2023; Rainie et al., 2022). These concerns are often linked to the\nfear of the unknown due to an inadequate understanding of AI and machine learning (ML)\ntechnologies, as well as data security and privacy concerns stemming from the potential\nmalicious and unethical use of AI (Cheatham et al., 2019; Dorotic et al., 2024; Du & Xie,\n2021; Inman et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024). Furthermore, many consumers have exhibited\nlong-standing skepticism toward AI and AI-powered products and services (Glikson &\nWoolley, 2020; Tripathy, 2020). They continue to view rapidly developing AI technologies\nas posing significant risks to individuals and society (Guha et al., 2021; Haan, 2023; Longoni\net al., 2019). These concerns affect not only customers\u2019 perceptions of AI but also their\nperceptions of goods and services powered by AI technologies.\nThe preceding discussion suggests that it is unclear how the presence of AI technology in\nproducts and services may affect consumers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors toward those products\nand services. This presents a unique dilemma for companies. Companies integrating AI\ntechnologies into their offerings face a double-edged sword, as highlighting the presence of\nAI can significantly influence consumer decisions. Whether revealing the presence of AI\ntechnology by including the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in a product or service description\nresults in positive or negative customer outcomes has not been explored yet and requires\nthorough investigation.\nSeveral studies have examined the effects of artificial intelligence on consumers\u2019 attitudes\nand behaviors; however, most have focused on the acceptance of AI-powered devices in\nretail settings (Bhagat et al., 2023; Gursoy et al., 2019; Ladeira et al., 2023; Malhotra &\nRamalingam, 2023). While these studies have significantly improved our understanding of\nthe effects of AI-powered devices on customers\u2019 attitudes and behaviors toward those\ndevices, they did not address whether including (vs. not including) the term \u201cArtificial\nIntelligence\u201d in product descriptions affects customers\u2019 product or service selection. To\naddress this research gap, this study aims to investigate the effects of the presence of AI\ntechnology in AI-powered products and services by including (vs. not including) the term\n\n\fJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT\n\n3\n\n\u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d (vs. high tech) in the product or service description on customers\u2019\nbehavioral intentions toward those products and services.\nTrust is a key determinant of consumer adoption and use of technology (Hong &\nCha, 2013; van Pinxteren et al., 2019; Wirtz et al., 2018), especially in the case of AIpowered devices (Della Corte et al., 2023; Gillath et al., 2021; Pitardi & Marriott, 2021),\nsince trust reduces perceived uncertainty (Chi et al., 2023; Kong et al., 2024; Morgan &\nHunt, 1994). Considering that AI is a relatively new and unknown concept for most\nconsumers, trust, particularly emotional trust, can significantly affect consumers\u2019 atti\u00ad\ntudes and behaviors. Emotional trust extends beyond cognitive trust and represents\na deeper understanding, surpassing cognitive trust in predicting relationship outcomes\n(Webber, 2008). Emotional trust is essential for understanding sophisticated technolo\u00ad\ngies such as AI because it involves uncertainties and unknowns, requiring a \u201cleap of\nfaith\u201d (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004). As studies suggest that emotional trust is\na critical factor influencing customer behavioral intentions, this study aims to explore\nwhether customers\u2019 level of emotional trust can mediate the effects of using the term\n\u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in product and service descriptions on customers\u2019 behavioral\nintentions.\nAnother factor that can influence the effects of using the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in\nproduct and service descriptions on customers\u2019 behavioral intentions is the level of per\u00ad\nceived risk associated with AI-powered products and services, as perceived risk profoundly\nimpacts consumer attitudes and transaction intentions (Hong & Cha, 2013). Perceived risks\nof AI-powered products and services can be multifaceted, encompassing both financial and\nnon-financial risks such as loss of control and privacy, cybersecurity threats, negative\nemotions, the time and effort required for product and service learning, and other unknown\nrisks, which can be complex to process (Ameen et al., 2021; de Kerviler et al., 2016; Shin &\nLin, 2016). However, consumers\u2019 perceptions of the overall level of risk posed by AIpowered products and services are likely to moderate the effect of including the term\n\u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in product and service descriptions on emotional trust, thereby\nultimately influencing consumers\u2019 behavioral intentions toward those products and\nservices.\nIn summary, this study aims to investigate the effect of the inclusion of the \u201cArtificial\nIntelligence\u201d term in product and service descriptions on behavioral intentions and whether\nthis effect is mediated by emotional trust. This study further examines whether perceived\nrisk moderates the relationship between the inclusion of the \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d term in\nproduct descriptions and emotional trust. The findings of this study are likely to provide\nsignificant insight to marketers on whether to promote the presence of AI technology in\ntheir product descriptions. Findings will help identify the underlying mechanism of the\neffect of the inclusion of the AI term in product descriptions on customers\u2019 behavioral\nintentions.\n\nLiterature review and hypotheses development\nArtificial intelligence and consumer sentiment\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to novel technologies that allow computer systems to\nunderstand, learn, reason, and behave like humans (Bowen & Morosan, 2018). AI\n\n\f4\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\ntechnologies are \u201ccomputing agents that act intelligently\u201d (Poole & Mackworth, 2010, p. 3)\nand empower machines with mechanical, analytical, intuitive, and empathetic intelligence\n(M. H. Huang & Rust, 2018; Rust, 2020). They imitate human capabilities by modeling\nbiological and natural intelligence through algorithmic frameworks. While AI can surpass\nhuman accuracy, it differs from human intelligence as it relies on data processing capabil\u00ad\nities and transformation to replicate biological and innate intelligence for predictive pur\u00ad\nposes rather than achieving true \u201chuman\u201d intelligence (Dwivedi et al., 2021; Gupta et al.,\n2020).\nAs the volume of AI-powered goods and services marketed to consumers con\u00ad\ntinues to increase, consumer sentiment toward security, comfort, and reliance on AI\ntechnologies has been the central debate. Historical missteps in AI technology\ndevelopment and implementation, immature introduction of AI technologies, inade\u00ad\nquate understanding of algorithmic functions, and lack of transparency in data\ncollection and usage have led to consumer distrust in AI technologies (Cheatham\net al., 2019; Glikson & Woolley, 2020; Kopalle et al., 2022; Tripathy, 2020). During\nthe initial stages of AI development, consumers encountered various malfunctioning\nissues like inaccuracy in facial recognition, medical diagnoses, and services received\nvia chatbots (Tripathy, 2020). In recent years, consumer trust in AI and the\ncompanies using it has diminished by the heightened concerns arising from the\npublic\u2019s increased awareness of AI\u2019s negative implications, including consumer\nprivacy, algorithmic bias, data security, ethical decisions, and other unknown risks\n(Cheatham et al., 2019; Guha et al., 2021; Haan, 2023; Longoni et al., 2019). Scholars\nsuggest that failing to address key consumer concerns (e.g., cybersecurity, compro\u00ad\nmise of decision-making autonomy, AI biases, and aligning with ethical values) (Du\n& Xie, 2021) could hinder companies from adopting AI, particularly for customerfacing implementation (Guha et al., 2021)\nThe exponential growth of AI technologies in recent years has intensified the\nurgency surrounding consumer concerns (Du & Xie, 2021). Moreover, a general\ninadequacy of AI knowledge among consumers significantly contributes to\na pervasive sentiment of unease toward AI-powered products among consumers.\nFamiliarity is critical in reducing perceived uncertainty and fostering trust-related\nknowledge (Chi et al., 2021; Komiak & Benbasat, 2006) and intentions to use new\ntechnologies (Gefen et al., 2003). Research among US consumers reveals that 45% of\nsurveyed respondents lack an understanding of AI and machine learning technolo\u00ad\ngies (Dencheva, 2023). In another research conducted with UK consumers, most\nrespondents indicated limited knowledge about AI despite knowing what AI is\n(Holder et al., 2018). The hype around AI has persisted for decades. Yet, we are\nstill in the initial stages of comprehending the scope and nature of risks (e.g.,\nperformance, psychological, social, financial, payment, data security, and ethical\nconcerns) associated with AI (Cheatham et al., 2019). Risk assessment of implement\u00ad\ning AI is complicated and how to increase controls to mitigate risks can be complex\nas well. This process entails an understanding of factors like algorithm complexity,\ndata requirements, interactions between humans and machines and interactions\nwithin machines, levels of vulnerability to misuse, and the extent of AI integration\ninto the business or its products (Cheatham et al., 2019). Since most consumers lack\nthe level of knowledge required to understand those factors, the resulting perceived\n\n\fJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT\n\n5\n\nuncertainty has been leading to consumer objection to the use of AI technology in\ngoods/services (Fang et al., 2014; McKnight et al., 1998). Given the current senti\u00ad\nment landscape toward AI, we argue that when the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d is\nincluded (vs. excluded) in the product or service description, consumers are less\nwilling to make a purchase.\nHypothesis 1: The inclusion of the AI term in the product or service description has\na negative impact on consumers\u2019 purchase intention.\n\nThe mediating effect of emotional trust\nThis study investigates the negative effect of including the \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d term on\nconsumer purchase intention via the theoretical lens of The Commitment-Trust Theory\n(Morgan & Hunt, 1994) and Uncanny Valley Theory. The Commitment-trust theory\nunderscores that trust is the key mechanism that reduces uncertainty and drives consumer\ncommitment from establishing, developing, to maintaining successful exchanges between\ntwo parties (Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Wang et al., 2020). When consumers make decisions to\npurchase AI-powered products or services, trust can be a fundamental mechanism that\nleads to intentions to acquire. Trust is defined as \u201cthe willingness of a party to be vulnerable\nto the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform\na particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control\nthat other party\u201d (Mayer et al., 1995). Consumer trust plays a critical role in understanding\ntheir willingness to use AI and other technology-mediated transactions (Chi et al., 2021; Du\n& Xie, 2021; Hasan et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). In the context of purchasing AI-powered\nproducts, consumer trust can be intricate as it encompasses not only trust in the technology\nitself but also in the sellers\u2019 intentions behind integrating AI into product design and the\napplication of AI during product usage (Ameen et al., 2021).\nAs suggested by the Commitment\u2013Trust Theory, trust is a key mechanism that reduces\nperceived uncertainty (Morgan & Hunt, 1994). Numerous studies have reported that\ncustomers often trust AI less than humans and tend to hold AI to a higher standard, even\nperfection (Davenport et al., 2020; Gray, 2017). As such, trust can be damaged severely\nwhen errors occur in AI devices. Trust is evaluated via two routes \u2013 cognitive and emotional\nroutes (Gillath et al., 2021; Glikson & Woolley, 2020; Johnson & Grayson, 2005). A high\nlevel of trust can manifest as strong faith in using AI (Hengstler et al., 2016; Johnson &\nGrayson, 2005) and the ability to understand AI algorithms and functional data processing\nlogic (Lee & See, 2004). Cognitive trust refers to one\u2019s confidence in the trustee and their\nability based on existing knowledge about whether others will fulfill their responsibilities\n(Gillath et al., 2021; Johnson & Grayson, 2005). Individuals develop higher cognitive trust\nwhen the trustee makes fewer mistakes and has expertise corresponding to their obligations.\nEmotional trust refers to the confidence in the trustworthiness of others based on one\u2019s\nsubjective feelings. Although emotional and cognitive trust can be correlated, the former is\na feeling, whereas the latter is a judgment.\nOn the other hand, the uncanny valley theory (UTV), proposed by Mori (1970), offers\na relevant theoretical explanation. This theory suggests that consumers may initially hold\npositive attitudes toward anthropomorphic elements in products. However, as these\n\n\f6\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\nfeatures become increasingly human-like, people\u2019s perceptions and reactions can turn\nnegative (M. Lin et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022; Yu, 2020). This negativity may be caused\nby feelings of eeriness, distrust, or discomfort, ultimately leading to decreased trust and\npurchase intention. Since AI-powered products and services have characteristics and\nabilities that resemble those of humans, this may lead to a decrease in emotional trust\nand purchase intention.\nEmotional trust plays a critical role in assessing the pros and cons of sophisticated\ntechnologies such as AI due to the level of uncertainties and unknowns associated with\nthose technologies (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004). The recent breakthroughs in\nAI technology (e.g., generative AI models such as ChatGPT, search AI technologies such\nas Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot AI) have raised serious concerns about the\npotential unknowns associated with the AI technology and the general public\u2019s under\u00ad\nstanding of those potential unknowns. Due to their limited knowledge about and\nunderstanding of AI technologies, consumers may not be able to make informed\njudgments about whether they should trust the AI algorithms and functional data\nprocessing logic (e.g., cognitive trust). Therefore, when the term \u201cArtificial\nIntelligence\u201d is used in describing a good or service (e.g., AI-powered), consumers\nmight be less capable of evaluating the appropriateness of that product or service\nsince they cannot determine whether they should trust the AI technology embedded\nin the product or service (e.g., cognitive trust). Instead, their holistic feelings about\nwhether they can trust the product or service (i.e., emotional trust) are more likely to\ninfluence their purchase decisions. Therefore, we operationalize consumer trust in AIpowered products as emotional trust.\nStatistical models/algorithms are vulnerable to consumer distrust. Research shows that\nconsumers lose confidence more quickly when the same mistake is made by statistical\nmodels (vs. humans) (Dietvorst et al., 2015); likewise, they tend to trust human experts\nmore than statistical models even when both offer the same advice (\u00d6nkal et al., 2009).\nAlgorithms lack human empathy and the ability to process qualitative/unstructured infor\u00ad\nmation. The inherent tendency to neglect key evidence (i.e., the \u201cbroken leg hypothesis\u201d)\nmakes it challenging to entrust important decisions to AI algorithms (Longoni et al., 2019).\nConsumers\u2019 historical lack of confidence in statistical models/algorithms has been observed\nin predicting market demand (Sanders & Manrodt, 2003), evaluating employee perfor\u00ad\nmance (Highhouse, 2008; Kuncel et al., 2013) and forecasting consumer preferences\n(Yeomans et al., 2019). Furthermore, consumers view AI bots as less trustworthy when\nhandling payment information and providing recommendations (Luo et al., 2019). Scholars\nsuggest this perception is linked to algorithm aversion as well as feelings associated with the\nuncanny valley (Dietvorst et al., 2015; Kestenbaum, 2018). In technology-mediated pur\u00ad\nchases, although uncertainties can be mitigated over time through repeated experiences\n(Hong & Cha, 2013), the swift pace of AI development and implementation has limited\nmost consumers\u2019 opportunities for first-hand knowledge of various AI products and\nservices. Therefore, including the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in a product or service\ndescription is likely to weaken consumers\u2019 confidence in the product or service\u2019s trust\u00ad\nworthiness, which in turn impacts purchase intention.\nHypothesis 2: Including the AI term in the product or service description weakens con\u00ad\nsumers\u2019 emotional trust, which in turn affects purchase intention.\n\n\fJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT\n\n7\n\nThe moderating effect of perceived risk\nThis study argues that the perceived risk of the products (both for the goods and\nservices) can condition the \u201cAI term\u201d effect on consumers\u2019 emotional trust and\npurchase intention. Perceived risk indicates potential loss and the perceptions of\nuncertainty (Jin et al., 2016). The perceived risk of a product or service purchase can\nencompass multiple dimensions (e.g., financial, psychological, social, performance,\nprivacy and personal risks, and payment risks), but not all dimensions equally\nimpact consumer decisions (Cox & Rich, 1964; Hong & Cha, 2013). Research\nshows that it is the overall risk perception that has robust influences on consumer\nattitudes and transaction intentions, as opposed to individual types of risk (Hong &\nCha, 2013). Therefore, this research focuses on a holistic perception of risk as\npotential uncertainties to consumers related to the product or service, rather than\ndissecting granular aspects of risk.\nConsumers make constant tradeoffs between what\u2019s given and what\u2019s taken. The\nkey advantages of using AI-powered products and services (e.g., personalization,\nconvenience, high service quality) can be a double-edged sword due to the implica\u00ad\ntions of the perceived sacrifice of using AI (Ameen et al., 2021). When the risks\nassociated with using an AI-powered product or service are low, such as robots used\nin room service delivery, consumers\u2019 acceptance of AI-powered products can be\nheavily influenced by factors that provide emotional and functional benefits (e.g.,\nperformance and effort) (Gursoy et al., 2019). High-risk products and services (e.g.,\nautomated vehicles, medical diagnoses, and investment decisions generated by AI)\nare less about the likelihood that consumers encounter risks immediately by pur\u00ad\nchasing the product or service; instead, they revolve around the potential dire\nconsequences when the product or service fails to perform as expected or other\ninadvertent outcomes (Jussupow et al., 2021). Negative consequences (e.g., false\nprediction, consumer privacy breach, cybersecurity, decision biases) of AI technology\nfailure can be more detrimental to consumer trust for high-risk purchases.\nStudies have shown negative attitudes and low trust toward AI-powered products\nand services, especially when high risks are involved (e.g., self-driving cars) (Longoni\net al., 2019; Tussyadiah et al., 2017). For instance, consumers believe that medical AI\nproviders are less capable of capturing individuals\u2019 unique circumstances and symp\u00ad\ntoms during diagnoses (Longoni et al., 2019). Consumers also fear the uncertainty\nthat when AI is the medical provider, responsibilities may be shifted to consumers\nin cases of service failure (Chi et al., 2021). Moreover, the scrutiny of algorithmic\nfailures has raised public awareness and amplified concerns regarding the risks\nassociated with AI technology, emphasizing prevalent issues including decision\nbias, discrimination, and system failures (Cheatham et al., 2019; Du & Xie, 2021;\nGlikson & Woolley, 2020; Longoni et al., 2019).\nA growing body of research underscores that a lack of trust in AI technology can\nresult in resistance toward its applications, particularly when it is used in customerfacing implementations (Hong & Cha, 2013; Longoni et al., 2019; Tussyadiah et al.,\n2017). When purchasing high-risk (vs. low-risk) products and services, the potential\nnegative consequences of AI technology can be weighed more heavily. Studies\nsuggest that in situations where perceived product or service risks are high, there\n\n\f8\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\nis a greater negative association between the presence of AI technology and con\u00ad\nsumer trust (Chi et al., 2021), a pattern similarly observed in smart technologies\n(Wu & Cheng, 2020). Therefore, we hypothesize that when purchasing high-risk\nproducts or services, the negative effect of including the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d\nis amplified to influence intentions to purchase.\nHypothesis 3: Perceived product or service risk moderates the indirect effect of inclusion of the\nAI term in the product or service description on purchase intention, mediated by emotional trust.\n\nMethodology\nOverview of the studies\nProposed hypotheses about the impact of the inclusion of the AI term in the product\ndescription on consumers\u2019 purchase intention were tested through a series of studies. More\nspecifically, Study 1 investigated the negative effect of the inclusion of the AI term in the\nproduct description on consumers\u2019 purchase intention (H1). Study 1 tested this main effect\nusing a moderately risky product, a TV (with AI term versus without AI term). Next, Study 2\ninvestigated the mediating effect of emotional trust on the relationship between the inclusion\nof the AI term in the product description and consumers\u2019 purchase intention (H2). More\nspecifically, in Study-2a, this mediation was tested using cars; in Study-2b, it was examined\nwith a customer service, and in Study-2c it was demonstrated using a refrigerator. Study 3\nexplored the possible boundary conditions that may affect the mediating effect of emotional\ntrust. We investigated whether the product\u2019s risk level (high-risk versus low-risk) moderates\nthe effect of the inclusion of the AI term in the product description on emotional trust (H3),\nfor both services (3a) and goods (3b). Study-3a explored the moderated mediation effect using\nillness diagnosis tools as a high-risk service and customer service as a low-risk service, while\nstudy-3b served as a robustness test on the same effect using a car as a high-risk product and\nvacuum cleaner as a low-risk product.

The first study was conducted to determine the perceived risk level of AIpowered services on college students at a major university located in the Northwestern\nUnited States. Students were provided with a list of possible AI-powered services (the list\nwas generated through online search from technology-related websites and online retail)\nand asked to rate the perceived risk of these services on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 indicated\nthe least risky and 7 indicated the riskiest. A total of 85 students participated in the study.\nAI-powered illness diagnosis services (M = 4.63, SD = 1.79) were ranked as having the\nhighest level of risk, whereas AI-powered customer services (M = 2.46, SD = 1.49) were\nindicated as having the lowest level of perceived risk. Furthermore, findings of the Paired\nSamples T-test indicated that AI-powered illness diagnosis services (M = 4.63, SD = 1.79)\nwere perceived as riskier than AI-powered customer services (M = 2.46, SD = 1.49), t (82) =\n9.408, p = 0.000.\nThe second pilot study was conducted online through Prolific (www.prolific.co) to\ndetermine the perceived risk level of AI-powered goods. A total of 201 participants were\nprovided a list of AI-powered products and asked to indicate the perceived risk level of\nthose products on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 indicated the least risky and 7 indicated the\nhighest level of risk. The order of the goods was randomized. The results indicated that AIpowered cars were perceived as the riskiest good (M = 5.79, SD = 1.35), whereas AIpowered vacuum cleaners (M = 2.16, SD = 1.23) were perceived as having the lowest level\nof risk. The results of the paired sample t-test indicated that AI-powered cars were perceived\nsignificantly riskier than AI-powered vacuum cleaners, t (200) = 31.14, p = 0.000. The\nresults also indicated that AI-powered TVs (M = 2.82, SD = 1.48) were perceived signifi\u00ad\ncantly riskier than AI-powered vacuum cleaners, t (200) = 6.91, p = 0.000) and less risky\nthan AI-powered cars (t (200) = 24.37, p = 0.000). Similarly, AI-powered smart locks (M =\n4.51, SD = 1.68) were perceived significantly riskier than AI-powered vacuum cleaners,\nt (200) = 18.73, p = 0.000) and less risky than AI-powered cars (t (200) = 11.77, p = 0.000).\nTherefore, AI-powered TVs and Smart Locks were considered medium-risk goods.\n\nStudy-1\nMethodology\nThe goal of the first study was to demonstrate the direct negative effect of the\ninclusion of the AI term in the product description on consumers\u2019 purchase intention.\nIn this study, we used a moderate-risk product, TV. A total of 199 Prolific workers\n(MAge: 39.90, 54.08% female) were presented with a description of a high-technology\ntelevision. In this experiment, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups.\nAll subjects were provided with a product description of a high-tech TV, detailing its\nvarious features. In order to control the possible effect of previous experience or brand\nimage, we used a fictive brand, Elevo. The product descriptions were almost identical.\nThe first group\u2019s product description explicitly mentioned an AI-powered TV\u201d term.\nConversely, the second group received the same product description without artificial\nintelligence term as \u201cNew technology TV.\u201d After reading the product description, the\nsubjects then reported their purchase intentions of the products using the following\n\n\f10\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\nscale adopted from Baker and Churchill (1977): \u201cI would like to try this AI-powered\n(or new technology TV) TV,\u201d \u201cI would buy this AI-powered TV (or new technology\nTV) if I see it in a store,\u201d and \u201cI would actively seek out this AI-powered TV\u201d (or new\ntechnology TV) (1\u2014 Strongly Disagree; 7\u2014 Strongly Agree). The measurement scale\nused in this study indicated high internal consistency with a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of\n0.935.\nFindings\nAn independent sample t-test was conducted to compare the mean purchase intention\nscores between the two groups, where 1 referred to the group that saw the product\ndescription with the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence,\u201d and 0 referred to the group that saw\nthe product description without the AI term. The results of the study indicated that\nparticipants who saw the Artificial Intelligence term in the product description (M = 3.58,\nSD = 1.66) indicated lower purchase intention than the participants who did not see the AI\nterm in the product description (M = 4.17, SD = 1.38), t (197) = \u22122.72, p = 0.007. The\nfindings of the study indicated that the inclusion of the Artificial Intelligence term in the\nproduct description decreased the purchase intention of a product, therefore, H1 was\nsupported.\n\nStudy-2a\nMethodology\nThe objective of this study was to validate the findings of Study 1 and to determine the\nunderlying mechanism that accounted for the impact of including the AI term in the\nproduct description on consumers\u2019 purchase intention. Thus, the effects of the inclusion\n(or exclusion) of the Artificial Intelligence term in the product description on consumers\u2019\npurchase intention and the mediating effect of emotional trust on the relationship between\nthe product description that included (or excluded) AI term and purchase intention were\nexamined. In this study, a total of 200 Prolific workers (MAge: 40.1, 46% female) were hired\nand provided a product description for a car. In this study, participants were randomly\nassigned to one of two groups, and each group received a product description of a high-tech\ncar, outlining its distinct features. The car\u2019s features in the product description were nearly\nidentical, except for the inclusion of the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence.\u201d The description for\nthe first group included an \u201cAI-powered car,\u201d whereas the description for the second group\nexcluded the AI term and was simply provided as a \u201cnew technology car\u201d instead. In this\nexperiment, we incorporated a different fictional brand name, \u201cNeura,\u201d compared to the\nbrand used in the first experiment, to enhance credibility. We controlled the age, gender,\nand product familiarity. Purchase intention (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha = 0.898) was measured by\nthe scale mentioned in the previous experiment. Emotional trust measure was adopted from\nKomiak and Benbasat (2006): \u201cI feel secure about relying on AI-powered cars (New\nTechnology Cars),\u201d \u201cI feel comfortable about relying on the AI-powered cars (New\nTechnology Cars),\u201d and \u201cI feel content about relying on the AI-powered cars (New\nTechnology Cars)\u201d (1\u2014 Strongly Disagree; 7 Strongly Agree). The scale used in this\nexperiment demonstrated high internal consistency with a Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.974.\n\n\fJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT\n\n11\n\nFigure 1. The Findings of Study 2a.\n\nFindings\nTo validate the results of Study 1, an independent sample t-test was conducted to compare\nthe mean purchase intention scores between the two groups, where 1 referred to the group\nthat saw the product description with the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence,\u201d and 0 referred to the\ngroup that saw the product description without the AI term. The results revealed\na significant negative effect of the inclusion of AI term in the product description on\npurchase intention (MwAI = 3.35 vs. Mw/oAI = 4.23, t (198) = \u22124.63, p = 0.000), providing\nfurther support for Hypothesis-1.\nTo test Hypothesis 2, which examines the mediating effect of Emotional Trust on the\nrelationship between the effect of including (vs. excluding) AI term in the product descrip\u00ad\ntion and purchase intention. A mediation analysis using the PROCESS Macro Model 4\n(Hayes, 2017) was conducted with 5,000 bootstrapped samples. As presented in Figure 1,\nthe findings of the mediation analysis revealed a significant mediating effect of emotional\ntrust (indirect effect = \u22120.444, SE = 0.149, 95% CI [\u22120.749, \u22120.159]) on the relationship\nbetween the inclusion of the AI term in the product description and consumers\u2019 purchase\nintention. More specifically, the inclusion of the AI term negatively impacted consumers\u2019\nemotional trust (\u03b2 = \u22120.409, t = \u22123.007, p = 0.003), while emotional trust positively influ\u00ad\nenced consumers\u2019 purchase intention (\u03b2 = 0.773, t = 15.657, p = 0.000). The total effect of\nincluding the AI term on Purchase Intention was significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.599, SE = 0.197, p =\n0.002), while the direct effect was not significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.154, SE = 0.134, p = 0.252). This\nresult suggests the presence of a mediating effect, thereby supporting Hypothesis 2.\n\nStudy-2b\nMethodology\nStudy 2b sought to replicate the findings of the previous experiments and further investigated\nthe effects of the inclusion (vs. exclusion) of the AI term in service description on consumers\u2019\npurchase intention and the mediating effect of emotional trust. In this experiment, our goal\nwas to determine whether the same findings observed in the context of commodity purchase\nwould apply to service consumption as well. To explore this, we chose high-tech customer\nservice in this study. To test these main and mediation effects, the study was conducted online\nthrough Prolific, and a total of 200 participants (46% female; Mage = 40.25) were recruited.\n\n\f12\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\nFigure 2. The Findings of Study 2b.\n\nThe participants were randomly and evenly assigned to two groups: a service description with\nthe AI term and a service description without the AI term. The first group was provided with\na short description of a high-tech customer service as \u201cAI-powered customer service,\u201d while\nthe other group was given the same description excluding the AI term as \u201cnew technology\ncustomer service.\u201d After reading these service descriptions, participants were asked to provide\ninformation regarding their emotional trust (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.967) and purchase inten\u00ad\ntion (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.910) toward these services. We also controlled product familiarity,\nage, and gender.\nFindings\nAn independent sample t-test was conducted to compare the mean purchase intention\nscores between the two groups to validate the findings of Study 1 in a service setting, where\n1 referred to the group that saw the service description with the AI term, and 0 referred the\ngroup that saw the product description without the AI wording as \u201cnew technology\u201d\ninstead. The results indicated a significant negative effect of the inclusion of AI term in\nthe product description on purchase intention (M wAI = 4.15 vs. Mw/oAI = 4.67, t (198) =\n\u22122.58, p = 0.010), providing additional support for Hypothesis-1.\nIn order to test the mediation effect of emotional trust we conducted a mediation analysis\nusing Model 4 of the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2017) with 5,000 bootstrapped samples. In\nparallel with the results of the previous experiment, the results indicated that emotional\ntrust negatively mediated the impact of the inclusion of AI term in the product description\non purchase intention (indirect effect = \u22120.516, SE = 0.163, 95% CI [\u22120.834, \u22120.192]). The\ninclusion of the AI term in the product description negatively affected consumers\u2019 emo\u00ad\ntional trust (\u03b2 = \u22120.485, t = \u22122.977, p = 0.003) and emotional trust positively impacted\nconsumers\u2019 purchase intention (\u03b2 = 0.710, t = 15.283, p = 0.000). The total effect of includ\u00ad\ning the AI term on purchase intention was significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.839, SE = 0.234, p = 0.000).\nThe results of this study mirrored those of the earlier experiment, confirming the presence\nof the mediation effect and providing support for Hypothesis 2. Additionally, the direct\neffect was significant (Effect = \u22120.323, SE = 0.162, p = 0.047) implying that including the AI\nterm in the product description did not only negatively impact purchase intention indirectly\nthrough emotional trust but also had a direct negative influence on purchase intention. The\nresults are illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n\fJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT\n\n13\n\nFigure 3. The Findings of the Study 2c.\n\nStudy-2c\nMethodology\nIn this study, we also aimed to replicate the findings of the previous experiments and\nexplore the mediating effect of emotional trust on the relationship between the\ninclusion of AI term in the product description and purchase intention. In this\nexperiment, we tested these relationships on a low-risk product, a refrigerator.\nSimilar to the previous studies, 198 Prolific participants were evenly and randomly\nassigned one of the two conditions. In both conditions, participants were presented\nwith a product description detailing a high-tech refrigerator. In the first scenario, the\nproduct was labeled as the \u201cAI-Powered Refrigerator,\u201d while in the second scenario, it\nwas provided without the AI term as the \u201cNew Technology Refrigerator.\u201d The remain\u00ad\ning portions of the description and features were nearly identical. After they read the\nproduct description, the participants were asked about their emotional trust\n(Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.971) and purchase intention (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.932) toward\nthis refrigerator. We also controlled age, gender, and product familiarity in this study.\nFindings\nTo examine the main effect of the inclusion of the AI term on purchase intention and to\nvalidate the finding of Study-1, we conducted an independent samples t-test analysis. The\nfindings of the study uncovered a significant negative impact of the inclusion of AI term in\nthe product description on purchase intention (M wAI = 3.45 vs. Mw/oAI = 4.26, t (196) =\n\u22123.63, p = 0.000), thereby providing further evidence for Hypothesis-1.\nTo test the mediation effect, we employed Hayes\u2019 Macro Model 4, using 5,000\nbootstrapping samples. The results of the mediation analysis replicated the findings of\nprevious studies and revealed that emotional trust mediates the effect of including the\nAI term in the product description on consumers\u2019 purchase intention for refrigerators\nas well (indirect effect = \u22120.505, SE = 0.175, 95% CI [\u22120.846, \u22120.150]). Particularly, the\ninclusion of the AI term in the product description negatively impacted the consumer\u2019s\nemotional trust (\u03b2 = \u22120.414, t = \u22122.919, p = 0.003), and emotional trust positively\naffected consumers\u2019 purchase intention (\u03b2 = \u22120.757, t = 16.081, p = 0.000).\nAdditionally, the total effect of the inclusion of AI term in the product description on\npurchase intention was significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.612, SE = 0.228, p = 0.008), while the direct\n\n\f14\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\neffect was insignificant (\u03b2 = \u22120.107, SE = 0.152, p = 0.483). The results are presented in\nFigure 3.\nAs it is demonstrated in the studies above, emotional trust has been identified as\na mediator in the relationship between the use of the AI term and purchase intention for\nhigh-tech cars, refrigerators, and customer services. However, it is unknown if the perceived\nrisk level of the products moderates this mediating effect. To address this gap, we conducted\ntwo studies to investigate this moderated mediation effect.\n\nStudy-3a\nMethodology\nIn this study, we aimed to reveal whether the perceived risk level of the products moderates\nthe mediating role of emotional trust in the relationship between the inclusion of AI term in\nthe product description and consumers\u2019 purchase intention. To test this moderated mediation\nrelationship, we conducted an experimental study with a 2 (AI-powered Service vs. New\nTechnology Service) x 2 (High-risk Service [Illness Diagnosis Service] vs. Low-risk Service\n[Customer Service]) design. This experiment was conducted online through Prolific, and\na total of 401 participants (MAge: 41.1, 44.6% female) took part in the study. Participants were\nrandomly assigned to one of the four conditions (\u201cAI-powered Illness Diagnosis Service,\u201d\n\u201cNew Technology Illness Diagnosis Service,\u201d \u201cAI-powered Customer Service,\u201d or \u201cNew\nTechnology Customer Service.\u201d The participants were provided with a product description\nof a high-tech Illness diagnosis service or customer services. The descriptions of the illness\ndiagnosis services were nearly identical except for the inclusion (or exclusion) of the artificial\nintelligence term. Similarly, the descriptions of the customer services were also almost the\nsame. Participants were requested to answer the questions regarding their purchase intention\n(Cronbach Alpha = 0.914) and emotional trust (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.972). We also con\u00ad\ntrolled product familiarity and demographic information (gender and age). In this study,\na fictive brand \u201cNeura\u201d was used to eliminate the influence of prior experience and knowledge\nabout the services.\nFindings\nIn order to test the moderation effect of the perceived risk level of the products on the\nmediating effect of emotional trust on the relationship between the inclusion of AI term in\nthe product description and consumers\u2019 purchase intention, we conducted a moderated\nmediation analysis using Hayes Macro Model 7 via SPSS (5,000 bootstrapped samples). We\nset the inclusion of AI term in the product description as the independent variable, the\nperceived risk level of the product as the moderator, purchase intentions as the dependent\nvariable, and emotional trust as the mediating variable. As predicted the confidence interval\nfor the index of moderated mediation did not include zero (index = \u22120.522, SE = 0.24, 95%\nCI = [\u22120.993, \u22120.061]) indicating a significant moderated mediation through emotional\ntrust. For high-risk services, the negative effect of the inclusion of AI term in the product\ndescription on purchase intention was mediated by decreased feelings of emotional trust\n(indirect effect = \u22120.928, SE = 0.176, 95% CI = [\u22121.273, \u2212 0.590]). At low-risk products, the\nnegative mediation effect of emotional trust weakened (indirect effect = \u22120.406, SE = 0.163,\n95% CI = [\u22120.710, \u2212 0.072]). In summary, the negative mediating effect of emotional trust\n\n\fJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT\n\n15\n\non the impact of AI term on purchase intention was stronger for high-risk products,\ncompared to low-risk products. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was supported.\nStudy-3b\nMethodology\nTo validate the findings of our previous experiment, we conducted a replication experiment\nwith some modifications to the experimental settings. In this experiment, we also tested\nwhether the perceived risk level of the products moderates the mediating effect of emotional\ntrust on the inclusion of the AI term, affecting consumers\u2019 purchase intention. In this study,\nwe used goods instead of services in our 2 \u00d7 2 factorial experimental research design. This\ndesign consisted of two factors: the inclusion of the AI term in the product description and\nthe risk level associated with the product (High-risk or Low-risk product). For high-risk\nproducts, we employed a car, for the low-risk products we used a vacuum cleaner based on\nthe findings of the second pilot study. The experiment was conducted online through\nProlific. A total of 404 participants (MAge: 41.3, 49.3% female) were randomly assigned\none of the four conditions. Participants were provided with a product description.\nFollowing their review of the product descriptions, participants were asked to complete\na questionnaire regarding their emotional trust (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.976), and purchase\nintention (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.914). Additionally, product familiarity, age, and gender\nwere included as control variables. In this study, we used a different fictive brand name,\n\u201cQuanttech.\u201d\nFindings\nWe tested the moderated mediation effects of perceived risk level using Hayes Macro Model-7\nvia SPSS with 5000 bootstrapping samples. The findings of the study align with those of the\nprevious experiment and replicate the moderating effect of perceived risk levels of the\nproducts on the mediation effect of emotional trust in the relationship between the inclusion\nof the AI term and purchase intention (index = \u22120.557, SE = 0.21, 95% CI = [\u22120.973, \u22120.136]).\nMore specifically, the indirect effect through emotional trust was significant for the high-risk\nproduct (indirect effect = \u22120.656, SE = 0.163, 95% CI = [\u22120.979, \u2212 0.343]), but not significant\nfor the low-risk products (indirect effect = \u22120.099, SE = 0.143, 95% CI = [\u22120.383, 0.181]),\nwhich provided further support for hypothesis-3.\nRobustness test\nMethodology\nTo rule out the possible effect of the tone of product description on the experiment, we\nconducted a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial experimental study. In this study, we used smart locks since it\nwas perceived as a moderate-risk product in the pilot study. A total of 400 participants were\nrandomly assigned to one of the four conditions. The conditions were as follows, Cognitive\nproduct description with the AI term, Cognitive product description without the AI term,\nAffective product description with the AI term, and Affective product description without\nAI term. The affective product description was mostly focused on the product features such\nas \u201cbiometric fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, customizable access control, realtime security monitoring, and automatic alerts.\u201d The affective product description\n\n\f16\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\nhighlighted the emotions and feelings. In this experiment, we used a different fictive brand\nname, \u201cInnoviLock.\u201d\nFindings\nWe conducted Hayes Macro Model-7 via SPSS with 5000 bootstrapping samples whether\nthe tone of the product description moderates the mediation effect of emotional trust. The\nresults indicated that the tone of the product description did not affect the mediating effect\nof emotional trust (index = \u22120.009, SE = 0.22, 95% CI = [\u22120.453, 0.450]). The indirect effect\nof emotional trust was significant for both cognitive (indirect effect = \u22120.502, SE = 0.159,\n95% CI = [\u22120.819, \u2212 0.187]) and affective (indirect effect = \u22120.493, SE = 0.163, 95% CI =\n[\u22120.827, \u2212 0.182]) product descriptions. The findings of this experiment indicated that\nemotional trust mediates the effect of the AI term in the product description on purchase\nintention, regardless of the tone of the product description, whether cognitive or affective.\n\nDiscussion\nAs the topic of AI is relatively new, there has been a rapid increase in studies on consumer\nperceptions of AI and AI-powered consumption. Nevertheless, the findings of these studies\nindicate some contradictory results, mostly confined to narrowly defined AI-powered\nproducts. For example, Malhotra and Ramalingam (2023) indicated that anthropomor\u00ad\nphized AI provides a better shopping experience for consumers, leading them to prefer AIenhanced products more. Similarly, Bhagat et al. (2023) suggested that employing AI in\nretail enhances consumers\u2019 purchase intentions. On the other hand, Luo et al. (2019)\nindicated that customers tend to buy less and often end calls prematurely when they realize\nthey are interacting with AI-powered chatbots. This may be caused by the multidimensional\nnature of AI, which includes both functionality and emotions, as noted by Chen et al.\n(2022). Therefore, this research adds to the existing effort showcasing the mere presence of\nthe AI term in the product description on consumer attitudes and behaviors.\nWhile previous studies provided critical insight into the effects of the use of AI-powered\ndevices in retail settings, most did not explore the effects of including the AI term in product\ndescriptions and whether revealing the presence of AI technology can influence customer\nattitudes and behaviors toward that product at the decision-making stage. This study\naddresses this literature gap through three studies, encompassing six experiments, suggest\u00ad\ning that including the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in the product description negatively\ninfluences consumers\u2019 decision-making stage. More specifically, when the AI term is\nincluded in a product description, consumers are less likely to indicate a purchase intention\ntoward that product. Moreover, the inclusion of the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in\na product description lowers emotional trust, resulting in a negative mediation effect on\npurchase intention.\nThese findings align with the Commitment-Trust Theory, which posits that trust is the\nfundamental factor in mitigating uncertainty and fostering consumer commitment. This is\ncrucial for forming, developing, and sustaining successful interactions between two parties\neven including AI-powered product purchases (Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Wang et al., 2020).\nThe recent breakthroughs in AI have raised concerns about potential unknowns, capabil\u00ad\nities, and vulnerabilities of the algorithms, as well as ethical issues of using AI-powered\nproducts, potentially negatively impacting consumer trust and, consequently, their\n\n\fJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT\n\n17\n\npurchase intentions. In this research, trust is demonstrated to be a key factor in consumer\ndecisions to acquire AI-powered products, particularly when there is a stronger association\nwith perceived risks. Thus, the inclusion of the AI term in product descriptions could have\na greater impact on high-risk products compared to low-risk products.\nAnother reason contributing to the negative impact of AI on emotional trust and\npurchase intention is the nature of features provided by AI-powered products. These\nfeatures, including data collection and usage, surveillance and monitoring, autonomy in\ndecision-making, and predictive analytics, raise concerns about safety, security, and privacy.\nAdditionally, there is fear and risk associated with unauthorized access to data (Hasan et al.,\n2021; Meyer-Waarden & Cloarec, 2022). On the other hand, another potential reason for\nthis hesitation might stem from a fear of the unknown, intensified by misinformation and\nmisconceptions about AI. Given that AI is a relatively novel technology, carrying with it\nseveral uncertainties, including the AI term without sufficient context can lead to reduced\nemotional trust and purchasing confidence in AI-powered products. Additionally, the\nmoderating effect of perceived risk indicates that purchase intention and emotional trust\ndecrease, especially for high-risk goods/services.\nIn addition, the negative perceptions toward AI may be triggered by sci-fi dystopias (Leslie,\n2019). These negative portrayals, often perpetuated by movies and books, can significantly\ninfluence consumers\u2019 perceptions and trust in AI. The use of the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d\nmay subconsciously trigger these negative stereotypes, leading to behaviors aimed at avoiding\nit. For example, in several movies such as the \u201cTerminator\u201d franchise, \u201cEx Machina,\u201d \u201cI,\nRobot,\u201d and \u201cThe Creator,\u201d AI is depicted as engaging in conflicts or wars with humans in\ndystopian worlds. This portrayal can negatively affect perceptions of AI in several ways,\nincluding fear of losing control, misinterpretation of AI\u2019s capabilities and characteristics,\ntrust issues, and ethical concerns (Leslie, 2019; Thierer, 2022).\n\nManagerial implications\nThe findings of this study offer critical insights for managers involved in decision-making\nregarding AI-powered products and services. First and foremost, the results highlight the\nneed for a more nuanced approach to integrating AI into marketing strategies (Gursoy\net al., 2022). Although the concept of \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d is becoming increasingly\ntrendy and popular in today\u2019s technological landscape, it also brings with it uncertainties\nand apprehensions among consumers. Consequently, this study suggests that using the\nterm \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in marketing campaigns and product descriptions may nega\u00ad\ntively impact consumer demand. Alternatively, marketers could use phrases like \u201ccuttingedge technology\u201d or \u201cadvanced technology\u201d while emphasizing the benefits and features of\nAI technologies without explicitly mentioning \u201cArtificial Intelligence.\u201d This approach could\npotentially enhance sales and profitability.\nAlternatively, if they prefer to include the AI term in their products, managers could\nfocus on building a more trustworthy brand image, thereby enhancing consumers\u2019 emo\u00ad\ntional trust in their AI-powered goods and services. This, in turn, could lead to increased\npurchase intentions. Additionally, forming partnerships or alliances with companies that\nare already trusted by consumers could be a strategic move. Such collaborations might\nimprove consumer demand, as goods and services offered by more reputable firms are often\n\n\f18\n\nM. CICEK ET AL.\n\nmore appealing (Frank et al., 2023). Therefore, consumers may feel more secure and less\nanxious about using AI-powered products.\nManagers should also emphasize transparency regarding their AI-powered products to\nmitigate privacy concerns and associated risks. This could include clarifications about how\ntheir AI-powered product works, outlining its benefits, and providing guidance on personal\ndata protection and privacy assessment. Additionally, before launching new AI-powered\nproducts, managers should conduct market research to identify potential concerns, issues,\nand preferences related to these products. This approach allows for the necessary modifica\u00ad\ntions to their products and marketing strategies accordingly to increase consumer trust.\nMoreover, the findings of the research highlight that the negative impact of using AI\nterminology on purchase intention and emotional trust is moderated by the perceived\nrisk level associated with the goods/services. This suggests that managers need to pay\ngreater attention and caution when incorporating AI terms in marketing campaigns and\nproduct descriptions, particularly for goods and services perceived as high-risk. Doing so\ncan help deter potential negative perceptions and foster a more trusting relationship\nwith consumers.\n\nLimitations and future work\nThis study is not without its limitations, which could guide future research directions. The\nfirst limitation of this study is its exclusion of potential cultural differences affecting\nconsumers\u2019 purchase intentions and trust. Geert Hofstede (1984) proposed uncertainty\navoidance as a cultural dimension that varies across cultures. Therefore, future research\ncould investigate the effects revealed in this study across different countries and cultures,\nexamining the impact of cultural influences, particularly uncertainty avoidance, on the\nrevealed effects in this research.\nThe second limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, which does not account\nfor the evolution of consumers\u2019 knowledge and attitudes toward AI-powered products over\ntime. Future research could address this gap through longitudinal studies, offering insights\ninto how these perceptions change and develop as consumers gain knowledge on AI.\nThe third limitation of this study concerns the limited examination on factors that\nfurther condition the impact of the AI term on purchase intention. Research suggests that\nbrand trustworthiness and consumers\u2019 AI knowledge level can significantly affect decisions\nto purchase (e.g., Benedicktus et al., 2010). Therefore, future research may incorporate these\nfactors to enhance the understanding of the impact of the AI term on consumer purchase\ndecisions under various operating conditions.\nOur study\u2019s fourth limitation is the exclusion of anthropomorphism\u2019s influence in the\nexperiments. AI literature suggests the level of anthropomorphism in AI-powered products\ncan impact consumers\u2019 trust and purchase intention (Alsaad, 2023; Husain et al., 2023;\nH. Lin et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022). While some studies revealed positive effects, others\nindicated negative impacts. Further research could explore how the level of anthropo\u00ad\nmorphism affects the proposed relationship.\nAnother limitation of the study is that it only included emotional trust as a mediating\nvariable. However, there may be other variables that mediate the main effect. Accordingly,\nauthors can explore the mediating/moderating effects of other variables such as technology\nadoption rates, product category involvement and, AI familiarity.\n\n\fJOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT\n\n19\n\nDisclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\n\nORCID\nLu Lu\n\nhttp://orcid.org/0000-0001-9852-3560\n\nReferences\nAlsaad, A.

It aids in proliferating information and data sources,\nimproving software\u2019s data management capabilities, and designing intricate and advanced algorithms. AI is\nchanging the way brands and users interact with one another. The application of this technology is highly\ndependent on the nature of the website and the type of business. Marketers can now focus more on the customer\nand meet their needs in real time. By using AI, they can quickly determine what content to target customers and\nwhich channel to employ at what moment, thanks to the data collected and generated by its algorithms. Users\nfeel at ease and are more inclined to buy what is offered when AI is used to personalise their experiences. AI tools\ncan also be used to analyse the performance of a competitor\u2019s campaigns and reveal their customers\u2019 expecta\u00ad\ntions. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to analyse and interpret data without being\nexplicitly programmed. Furthermore, ML assists humans in solving problems efficiently. The algorithm learns\nand improves performance and accuracy as more data is fed into the algorithm. For this research, relevant ar\u00ad\nticles on AI in marketing are identified from Scopus, Google scholar, researchGate and other platforms. Then\nthese articles were read, and the theme of the paper was developed. This paper attempts to review the role of AI\nin marketing. The specific applications of AI in various marketing segments and their transformations for\nmarketing sectors are examined. Finally, critical applications of AI for marketing are recognised and analysed.\n\n1. Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) will become an integral part of every\ncommercial entity across the globe in the long term. The new trends in\nAI-driven automation reflect substantial changes in the AI landscape. It\nis evident in the form of reconfigured ideas, interests, and investments in\nthe field of AI adoption by the enterprise [1\u20133]. This technology is so\u00ad\nphisticated enough to recognise faces and objects, which has enormous\nimplications for various business applications. For security purposes,\nfacial recognition can distinguish individuals; On the other hand, object\ndetection can be used to distinguish and analyse images. AI treats human\nimages like cookies, allowing for more personalised services based on\ncustomers\u2019 preferences. Some businesses are experimenting with facial\n\nrecognition to diagnose their customers\u2019 moods and, as a result, make\nappropriate product recommendations [4,5].\nAI is primarily concerned with user retention and lead conversion in\ndigital marketing. It can guide a user in the direction that aligns with the\nbusiness\u2019s goals by using intuitive AI chatbots, intelligent email mar\u00ad\nketing, interactive web design, and other digital marketing services.\nSeveral factors determine the impact of AI on digital marketing. ML, a\nsubset of AI, is concerned with computer programmes that access data\nand use it to learn independently. It compiles data from various places,\nincluding social media accounts, menus, online reviews, and websites.\nAI then uses the information to produce and deliver content relevant to\nthe audience. AI software enables in-depth online analysis of restaurants\nand their customers [6\u20138]. By implementing AI into marketing strategy,\n\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: ahaleem@jmi.ac.in (A. Haleem), mjavaid@jmi.ac.in (M. Javaid), qadriasim72@gmail.com (M.

These platforms thoroughly assess users\u2019 in\u00ad\nformation before directing them to offers appropriate to their wants. AI\nalso assists marketers in identifying and forecasting trends [9,10]. It\nprevents the company from overspending on digital advertising and\nensures that the money is well spent. The ability of a computer to\nrecognise objects, scenes, and activities in images is referred to as\ncomputer vision. Medical imaging analysis, face recognition, public se\u00ad\ncurity, and security monitoring are a few uses. If computer vision and AI\nare properly coupled, robots can predict what will happen in the future\nand act accordingly based on potential changes [11\u201313].\nAI has simplified building client profiles and comprehending the\ncustomer journey process. It allows brands to quickly and easily provide\nvaluable personalised content for the various client profiles in any\nmarketing funnel stage and throughout each avenue. Based on historical\ndata, AI applications in digital marketing can determine what content is\nmost likely to bring customers back to the site. AI identifies which\ncustomers are most likely to unsubscribe from a specific service and\nanalyses which features are standard among unsubscribers. As a result of\nthese analytics, marketers can plan their future campaigns and imple\u00ad\nment practices encouraging people to stay [14\u201316].\nAI applications in digital marketing can sift through billions of data\npoints on the internet and tell precisely what it needs to know for\nbusiness. It will describe what price will get the most conversions, when\nis the best time to post, what subject line will get the most attention, etc.\nIntelligent marketers stay current with all trends. It simplifies jobs and\nallows for more creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. It also adds value\nto the customers who benefit [17,18]. This paper examined AI and its\nneed in the marketing sector. We briefly cover the various applications\nof AI in several marketing segments. The paper also looks at other\nAI-based transformations for the marketing industries. Finally, the study\nidentifies and discusses important uses of AI in marketing.\n\npersonalising product suggestions to assisting in discovering the most\nsuccessful promotion channels, estimating churn rate or customer life\u00ad\ntime value, and building superior customer groups [26,27].\n1.2. Need for artificial intelligence in marketing\nAI is a fascinating and cutting-edge technology that complements a\ncompany\u2019s current content strategy. This technology is a broad term that\nencompasses a wide range of technologies such as natural language\nprocessing, ML, deep learning, computer vision, and many others. ML\nsignificantly impacts the digital marketing scenario because of its ability\nto analyse data and provide analytical tools. As a result, it assists mar\u00ad\nketing teams in conducting needs-based analyses. Businesses that use AI\ntools save time by focusing on other aspects of digital marketing. AI is a\nvast and ongoing technological evolution with far-reaching conse\u00ad\nquences. As a result, it is advised to embrace AI in digital marketing to\nfoster innovation and improve productivity in the coming years\n[28\u201330].\nMarketers can use AI to gain deeper consumer insights and better\nunderstand how to categorise and drive customers to the next step in\ntheir journey, providing the best possible experience. Marketers can\nincrease ROI without spending on ineffective attempts by thoroughly\nexamining consumer data and knowing what they truly want. They can\nalso avoid wasting time on mind-numbing advertising that irritates cli\u00ad\nents [31,32]. AI will personalise marketing in several ways. Many firms\nare already using AI to personalise their websites, emails, social media\nposts, videos, and other materials to better respond to customer de\u00ad\nmands. One of the primary goals of AI is to automate jobs that formerly\nneeded human intellect. This decrease in the number of labour resources\nrequired by an organisation to execute a project, or the amount of time\nan individual must dedicate to routine chores, allows for significant\nefficiency benefits [33,34].\n1.3. Research objectives\nBrands are using the power of AI to personalise marketing emails\nbased on consumer preferences and behaviour to increase engagement\nand persuade them to convert or make a buy. The AI automated the\nsegmentation process and began providing personalised material\nthrough email, SMS messaging, and in-app notifications based on each\nrecipient\u2019s lifecycle stage. Applying AI to existing cyber-attack tech\u00ad\nniques like spear-phishing will improve their effectiveness and, by\novercoming labour restrictions, increase the number of players capable\nof carrying them out. While AI is frequently portrayed as a danger to\nprivacy, it can also assist in preserving privacy and the ownership of\nprivate data and its derivative assets. Policymakers will have to carefully\nconsider how to control emerging technology, striking a balance be\u00ad\ntween the need to keep powerful weapons out of the hands of bad actors\nwhile also ensuring that innovation is not suffocated [35\u201337]. The pri\u00ad\nmary research objectives of this paper are as under:\nRO1: To brief about AI and its need in marketing;\nRO2: to study the specific utilities of AI in various marketing\nsegments;\nRO3: to explore various AI-based transformations for marketing\nsectors;\nRO4: to identify and discuss significant AI applications for\nmarketing.\n\n1.1. Artificial intelligence\nAI is a computer science technology that teaches computers to\ncomprehend and emulate human communication and behaviour. Based\non the data provided, AI has created a new intelligent machine that\nthinks, responds, and performs jobs the same way people do. AI can do\nhighly technical and specialised activities such as robotics, speech and\npicture recognition, natural language processing, problem-solving, etc.\nAI is a collection of several technologies capable of executing tasks that\nneed human intelligence. When applied to standard commercial pro\u00ad\ncesses, these technologies can learn, act, and perform with human-like\nintelligence. It simulates human intelligence in machines, saving us\ntime and money in business transactions [19\u201322].\nAI is concerned with creating intelligent machines that can think and\nact like humans. It provides exceptional opportunities for a wide range\nof industries. Every industry mentioned is either terrified or enthralled\nby the arrival of AI. AI creates intelligent machines and devices that can\nthink and react like humans. This technology has been dubbed the \u201cnext\nstep\u201d in the industrial revolution. It is believed that AI and ML hold\nsolutions to most of today\u2019s problems.\nFurthermore, AI may aid in the prediction of future problems. AI can\ncreate new technologies, industries, and environments. In a nutshell, AI\nsimulates human intelligence processes by machines. This may include\nlearning, reasoning, and, most importantly, the ability to self-correct\n[23\u201325].\nAI can analyse, comprehend, and make decisions. It is for existing\nuser data and is used to make market predictions and predict user\nbehaviour. It is also known as data forecast, and organisations world\u00ad\nwide use it to fine-tune their sales and marketing strategies to increase\nsales. Most AI applications in marketing nowadays employ ML, from\n\n1.4. The method used to write this paper\nReading several related articles, blogs, and books on Artificial in\u00ad\ntelligence for marketing was done as part of this literature-based eval\u00ad\nuation. The authors then critically analysed these publications in\nrelation to the research issue. This literature review offers a compre\u00ad\nhensive status on researching the particular issue. This paper contains\nconceptual categories related to AI for marketing and typically follows a\n120\n\n\fA. Haleem et al.\n\nInternational Journal of Intelligent Networks 3 (2022) 119\u2013132\n\nstructure. Thus, to write this paper, almost 217 research publications\nwere examined. This study answers the research questions and provides\na detailed discussion on AI for marketing.\n\nadvertising is scaled. People like to view advertisements that are rele\u00ad\nvant to them or address their concerns. By creating targeted ad strategies\nfor suitable customers, marketers can ensure that they are dealing with\nthe right consumer core groups who are most likely to behave and\nrespond positively to the advertising in front of them. Marketers can do\nthis by leveraging the digital superintelligence of AI models and algo\u00ad\nrithms [46\u201348]. AI can help marketers with targeted marketing cam\u00ad\npaigns that involve ad targeting. It can use ML to distinguish between\nbuying, actual conversion, and exploratory behaviour and retarget\nprospects with a higher chance of converting them. Facial recognition\nsoftware, one of many amazing AI-driven tools, aids in tracking cus\u00ad\ntomers\u2019 in-store visits and linking images to their social media profiles.\nWhen paired with AI-powered smart notifications, these sophisticated\ntechnologies send real-time discount offers and welcoming messages to\neach visitor, resulting in a new level of customised user experience\n[49\u201352].\nAI is a strong tool when combined with high-quality market research\ndata. This enables companies to complete a wide range of tasks. The\nsegmentation of target groups is an important feature of this widely used\nuse case. AI is substantially faster and more efficient than humans in this\nwork [53\u201355]. Businesses may provide more tailored offers to their\ntarget audiences that they are more likely to accept if they conduct a\ndeeper investigation. With the fast spread of new technologies, many\nindustry leaders have been encouraged to move up to a more advanced\nand efficient field, in which AI has entrenched itself as the most useful.\nOrganisations with AI at their disposal will have a better chance of\nstaying ahead of the competition in various ways [56,57].\nMarketers can more precisely identify which customers should be\ntargeted and whether they should be included or excluded from the\ncampaign. Customers will be better matched to items they are likely to\nbuy, and irrelevant or out-of-stock products will be avoided. Brands can\n\n2. Specific utilities of artificial intelligence in various marketing\nsegments\nThe various primary marketing segments of AI initiatives are\ndepicted in Fig. 1. Pricing, strategy and planning, product, promotion,\nand place management have been vital in targeting AI-based systems in\nmarketing scenarios. The importance and significance of other issues\nsuch as targeting and positioning, situations, and thinking models to\u00ad\nwards the product design and end-customer needs have been targeted as\nessential aspects of marketing for AI applications [38\u201340].\nMarketers use AI to increase client demand. Customers have a pos\u00ad\nitive user experience through integrated applications that employ ma\u00ad\nchine intelligence. It keeps track of purchases, including where and\nwhen they are made. It can analyse the data and provide customised\nmarketing messages to customers. When a user visits a nearby retailer,\nthese messages contain suggestions and special offers to improve the\ncustomer\u2019s average order value [41,42]. Marketing gives the company a\ncompetitive advantage by using an integrated approach to system\nautomation. Decision-making and client micromanagement are advan\u00ad\ntages of the AI marketing approach. Data is critical for improving the\npatterns of material recommended to customers by ML algorithms.\nProgrammatic media bidding is the automated procedure for buying and\nselling internet advertising ads. These computer-based models inherit\nML traits, utilise audience data, and present relevant advertisements to\ntarget buyers [43\u201345].\nBecause AI algorithms and ML are used to assist models, the risk of\nhuman error is reduced, audience data is efficient, and display\n\nFig. 1. Several Segments for AI applications in Marketing Domain.\n121\n\n\fA. Haleem et al.\n\nInternational Journal of Intelligent Networks 3 (2022) 119\u2013132\n\nutilise AI to improve customer experience by providing tailored content\nand offers and excellent customer service to each consumer. Predictive\nmarketing analytics is one method that firms use with AI [58,59]. By\nanalysing data from previous occurrences, AI can reliably and\nadequately predict how performance will appear in the future,\ndepending on a range of parameters. Understanding what individuals\nvalue most can help make more meaningful recommendations to them.\nHowever, most AI-based customisation solutions start from the\ntop-down and are tailored to the individual rather than a whole group.\nThe capacity to employ AI to forecast the success of marketing initiatives\nand better tailor user experiences is a vast technical trend that will\ncontinue for many years [60\u201362].\nConversational search queries and algorithms are evolving due to AI,\nprompting search engine marketers and content developers to adapt.\nRegarding marketing automation, AI can free up critical human mar\u00ad\nketers\u2019 time while swiftly creating more focused marketing materials\nthat convert better with clients. Major social networks have vehemently\nopposed certain practices for marketers employing AI on social media.\nThis enables consumers to ask a customer support bot questions that do\nnot require a phone call or a complete human discussion. Millions of\nindividuals worldwide use vanishing messaging services for personal\ncontact with friends and marketers looking to interact with consumers\nmore genuinely and intimately. Brands can engage with individuals in\nunique and intimate ways where audiences spend time online, notably\non social media, thanks to the power of AI [63\u201365].\nAdditional products such as HubSpot\u2019s software may help with task\nmanagement, which automates specific emails via a process. While it is\ntrue that the low cost and high levels of efficiency of AI are appealing,\nthere are so many things AI can imitate. Marketers must access a large\namount of data to start AI marketing. Many marketing teams lack data\nscience and AI expertise, making it difficult to work with large amounts\nof data and provide insights [66,67]. To get programmes up and to run,\nenterprises should collaborate with third-party organisations that can\nhelp with data collecting and analysis to train AI systems and enable\ncontinuing maintenance. ML systems will learn to make correct, effec\u00ad\ntive judgments as they ingest more data. Process intelligence technology\nwill increasingly give businesses accurate and comprehensive insight\ninto their operations in real-time, allowing them to monitor and enhance\nthem [68\u201370].\nThis enables marketing teams to target the appropriate channels at a\nreasonable cost. As programmatic buying demonstrates, ML can\nenhance marketing flexibility to match clients\u2019 changing needs and in\u00ad\nterests. Different consumers respond to different messages across\nchannels; an emotional appeal may move some, others by humour, and\nstill others by logic. ML and AI can track which messages customers have\nreacted to and generate a more detailed user profile [71,72]. Marketing\nteams may then send users more personalised communications\ndepending on their preferences. However, if the data is not standardised\nand error-free, the insights will be useless, and AI algorithms may make\njudgments that harm marketing initiatives. Marketing teams must\nengage with data management teams and other lines of business to\ndevelop data cleansing and data maintenance processes before adopting\nAI marketing [73\u201375].\nAI refers to computational technologies that can do particular tasks\nin place of human intellect. This technology is advancing at breakneck\nspeed, similar to the exponential growth in database technology. Data\u00ad\nbases have evolved into the critical infrastructure that powers\nenterprise-level applications [76,77]. Big data and AI have a specific\nlink. Recent advances in AI development have primarily been driven by\n\u201cML\u201d AI chatbots can be trained on data sets containing text recordings\nof human conversations collected from messenger apps to understand\nwhat humans say and respond appropriately. AI can find patterns in\nmassive data sets that human vision cannot detect. Computer models\ncan identify an individual\u2019s personality traits more accurately than their\nfriends can, solely based on which Facebook posts the individual liked\n[78\u201380].\n\n3. Various AI-based transformations for marketing sectors\nDifferent AI-based transformations have made the marketing domain\nmore impactful and impressive. Fig. 2 exemplifies the various AI used to\naccomplish the several intended functions for resolving the marketing\nissues in today\u2019s competitive and advanced level marketing publicising.\nFurthermore, data collection, thorough market analysis, digitalisation\nthrough AI strategies, thoughtful understanding of customers, research\nand need finalisation in the market domain, etc., are additional inputs\nfor carrying out the AI implementation for handling the market level\ntactics [81\u201383].\nMarketers can use AI technology to identify trends and forecast them\nfor the future. Based on these facts, they can then decide how to allocate\ntheir budgets and whom to target. Brands can spend less on digital\nadvertising and more time on high-value work [7,10]. From the plan\u00ad\nning stage to the conversion and customer loyalty phases, AI plays a\ncritical role in the success of any marketing campaign. As a result,\ncompanies that fully utilise AI will gain a competitive advantage\n[84\u201386]. Machines with capabilities replicating cognitive functions\nassociated with the human mind, most notably learning and\nproblem-solving, have been developed. By analysing user data and\nassisting marketers in making sense of user intent, AI is helping mar\u00ad\nketers decipher the ever-changing world of content marketing. Mar\u00ad\nketers can use AI to generate content for simple stories such as stock\nupdates and sports reports [87,88].\nAI may also be used to automate the hunt for software security.\nSoftware designers could use AI to test for security flaws in their prod\u00ad\nucts, similar to how criminals look for undiscovered exploits in oper\u00ad\nating systems. While selecting a tool, It is important to consider the level\nof transparency required to understand why an AI platform made a\nparticular decision. Based on the algorithm, marketing teams may\nreceive a clear report on why a certain decision was taken and which\ndata influenced the decision. In contrast, systems that use deep learning\nat a higher level may not be able to provide definitive reasoning\n[89\u201391]. AI algorithms learn from data to create a valuable new pre\u00ad\ndiction tool, and the AI output can be separated from the original\ntraining data. As a result, to fully manage the data and its value, any\nassets must likewise be controlled. The infrastructure that enables the\ncollection, storage and analysis of big data should be treated as an asset\nin the same way it is in any other industry. Furthermore, specific in\u00ad\ndustries, such as banking, have systemic ramifications and are much\nmore critical to safeguard owing to third-party links [92,93].\nAI systems are constantly working in the background of popular\nproducts and services like Netflix, Amazon, Google etc. However, in\nrecent years, AI has made its way into marketing, assisting firms in\nimproving every stage of the consumer experience. Furthermore, re\u00ad\nsources previously available to huge firms have become affordable and\naccessible to medium- and small-sized businesses [94,95]. To better\nconsumer behaviour, create and understand more sophisticated buyer\nsegments, marketing automation, content creation, and sales fore\u00ad\ncasting, neural networks are developing dynamic tools for marketers,\nallowing us to process large data sets that provide more significant in\u00ad\nsights. Marketers can use predictive analytics to forecast the outcome of\na campaign by recognising patterns from previous campaigns. While\nneural networks have been around for a while, there is a greater demand\nto process Big Data, and as a result, systems are becoming much more\ndynamic and intelligent [96\u201398].\nThe AI can also comprehend advertising needs and recommend a\nsuitable target audience. The algorithms analyse user information such\nas age, gender, demographics, interests, and other vital information to\ndetermine the best audience for that specific brand. The way people\nsearch for information on the internet has changed. With the rise of\nvoice search devices, ML will become more precise in the coming years\ndue to this additional information input [99\u2013101]. Deep learning uses\nover a million data points to evaluate whether or not a prediction is\nvalid, similar to ML models. Because deep learning is a self-learning\n122\n\n\fA. Haleem et al.\n\nInternational Journal of Intelligent Networks 3 (2022) 119\u2013132\n\nFig. 2. AI transformations for marketing sectors.\n\nsystem, human intervention is no longer required, and the results can be\nused immediately. Marketing campaigns promote products and services\nvia different mediums by following specific themes and messages that\nhelp position a brand on the market, driving the top of the funnel and\ngenerating a pipeline for the business [102,103].\nAI technology can group and process data from various platforms to\ndraw conclusions and apply a data-driven decision-making process.\nTraditional marketing has radically transformed as power has shifted\nfrom industry to consumer. Companies are rapidly increasing their in\u00ad\nterest in and marketing spending on systems designed to capture, pro\u00ad\ncess, and use massive amounts of business and consumer data\n[104\u2013106]. Using AI solutions, marketers can now see what their cus\u00ad\ntomers think, say, and feel about their brands. Similarly, marketers can\ntruly understand how customers feel with the flood of social media at\ntheir disposal. Marketers with foresight can use this data in real-time to\nquickly modify messaging or branding for maximum effectiveness.\nWhile numerous methods for optimising digital advertising and\naccount-based marketing, AI solutions enable marketers to go further for\ndeeper insight and analysis [107\u2013110].\nBusiness concepts have developed from the assembly and promotion\nera to the connection and intelligence era [111\u2013113]. Over the years, the\nadvancement of computer science has fundamentally reworked the\nmeaning of ideas, innovation, and inventions. As a result, business\nmodels are evolving further. The Internet of Things has completely\ntransformed the concept of data handling. In addition to providing\ngreater access to consumer data, these devices track and record how\nusers interact with them, making the devices smarter.\nMoreover, as IoT technology research advances daily, businesses\nleverage it to interpret data collected from IoT widgets for improvement\nand growth. Any business\u2019s productivity can increase its understanding\nof the market and its customers. IoT devices can improve efficiency\nduring product development [114\u2013116].\nAI is expected to impact data transparency and security in the\n\ncoming years significantly. Customers will expect additional trans\u00ad\nparency into what data is gathered, how it is utilised, and how it is\nsafeguarded as they become more aware of how much data organisa\u00ad\ntions collect. AI-powered marketing tools optimise many companies\u2019\nemail marketing campaigns. Notably, they assist them in determining\nwhen to send personalised emails and what personalised content or\nproduct recommendations to send to various segments. AI shows the\nmost relevant content at the most effective times. This technology can\nassist in identifying top-performing content, planning for future content,\nrepurposing content, and optimising distribution [117\u2013119]. Automa\u00ad\ntion, data analytics, and natural language processing are already used in\nbusiness. These three fields of AI are streamlining operations and\nimproving efficiencies across industries.\n4. Artificial intelligence applications for marketing\nAI is employed in marketing campaigns across various industries,\nincluding finance, government, healthcare, entertainment, retail, and\nmore. Each use case yields different outcomes, such as improved\ncampaign performance, enhanced customer experience, or increased\nmarketing operations efficiency. Through programmatic advertising,\nmarketers are using AI to address various challenges. Programmatic\nplatforms use ML to bid on real-time ad space relevant to target audi\u00ad\nences. AI may also aid in the reduction of mistakes in marketing pro\u00ad\ncedures [120\u2013122]. So long as supervision and instruction exist, AI can\nexecute specialised activities more efficiently than humans. AI is\nconsiderably more likely to result in a higher return on investment since\nit can substantially speed up the process of marketing campaigns, cut\nexpenses, and improve efficiency.

Table 1 discusses the significant ap\u00ad\nplications of AI applications for marketing.\nAI for marketing is the best technique for predicting clients and\nimproving the customer journey by integrating customer data. AI ad\u00ad\nvancements provide businesses with more significant ways to do this.\nThis technology can assist in developing more successful marketing\nstrategies, enhance the customer journey, and transform how firms\nattract, nurture, and convert prospects [205,206]. Marketers use AI to\nseparate clients into key groups by segmenting them based on particular\nniches. Machine-generated content and automated personalisation for\nthe client journey are governed by AI content production. AI-powered\ncontent curation enables us to engage visitors better and stay on top\nof their thoughts by offering relevant material and added value while\nshowcasing industry expertise. It may be used for various purposes,\nincluding tailoring messages and making better consumer suggestions\n[207\u2013209].\nAI applications in marketing allow for customising a website\u2019s or\napp\u2019s services and content, the first step in driving personalised mar\u00ad\nketing campaigns and creating meaningful consumer engagement. AI\nchatbots use ML to improve and get smarter over time continually. These\nare vast, adaptable, and intelligent and give users a more lifelike expe\u00ad\nrience. Chatbots benefit organisations since they are excellent data\ncollection tools that dramatically cut personnel requirements and lower\nobstacles. Businesses use dynamic pricing modules to arrive at optimal\nprices for their products or services to stay competitive and swiftly boost\nprofitability. AI-controlled dynamic pricing modules enable them to\naccurately price their services, even for short periods. It is one of the\nmost profitable AI applications in marketing [210\u2013212]. In marketing,\nAI is extremely useful in carrying out retargeting methods.

Marketers may use AI to\nunderstand consumer behaviour,\nactions, and indicators. As a result,\nthey can target the correct approach\nto the right individual in a timely\nand effective manner. Marketers can\nuse AI in marketing to quickly\nprocess large amounts of data from\nsocial media, emails, and the Web. It\nmay be used in conjunction with\nmarketing automation to enable the\ntranslation of data into choices,\nmeaningful interactions, and a\nbeneficial influence on company\noutcomes. AI marketing aids in the\ncollection of data, the gathering of\nconsumer insights, the prediction of\ncustomers\u2019 next moves, and the\nmaking of automated marketing\ndecisions.\nAI has reduced human mistakes,\nparticularly in the most critical area.\nThis technology can also develop\nand optimise content in various\nemail formats that are nice and\nrelevant to the recipients. Without a\ndoubt, AI exists to prevent human\ninteraction, hence eliminating the\npossibility of human error. Due to\nfrequent data security issues, many\nfirms are concerned about their\nworkers\u2019 inability to protect client\ndata and other essential corporate\ndata. AI can assist in addressing\nvarious issues by learning, adapting,\nand responding to the cybersecurity\nrequirements of an organisation.\nMany of the slash-and-burn\nresources commonly used to design\nand implement a marketing strategy\ncan be eliminated with AI.\nAI uses the power of information\nsystems to connect end-to-end\nbusiness processes and give a\nfaultless experience. Marketers who\nharness AI\u2019s potential are\nexceptional performers in terms of\nmarketing outputs in enterprises. AI\napplications in marketing enable\nmarketers to create and implement\ncreative marketing strategies that\nare more customised and humancentred. These techniques often\nthrill customers and make them\nardent brand supporters. Interaction\ndesigns may be more appealing with\ntechnology like AI, allowing\nconsumer micro-moments control.\nThe rising benefits of AI enable\norganisations and redefining\nmarketing for a more elevated\nexperience.\nAI can analyse massive amounts of\nmarket data and predict what action\na user is likely to take next. It\ncomprehends billions of search\nqueries and assists in determining\nhow close a user is to make a\npurchase. AI also assists in the\nunderstanding of shortcomings and\ntaking appropriate action. The\nimpact of AI and ML extends far\n\n5. Discussion\nIterative processing and algorithms that enable software to learn\nfrom patterns allow AI to capture large amounts of data in record time.\nDifferent subfields of AI operate in distinct ways. ML is the study of how\ncomputers imitate or execute human learning behaviours to acquire new\nknowledge or skills and reorganise existing knowledge structures to\nimprove performance continuously. AI can be advantageous because the\ninterests and trends of different persons change regularly. Client per\u00ad\nsonas may alter slightly as trends shift over time, even if factors like\npersonality qualities remain constant. AI automation can potentially\nmake all of this much easier to organise. Marketing teams can keep up\nwith ever-changing trends and fads, ensuring they target clients and\npotential customers with relevant, up-to-date, personalised content.\nAI has become a perfect \u2018enabler\u2019 for marketing and sales pro\u00ad\nfessionals. It processes and utilises the vast volumes of available data. It\nautomates the creation of analytical models, uncovers hidden insights,\nand uses cognitive reasoning to adjust programme actions. ML lets\nmarketers complete the big picture by bringing in all the data to create a\nmission-critical consumer image in real time. It employs automated\ncognitive processes to solve complex data-rich challenges and algo\u00ad\nrithms to initiate data-driven actions. ML assists in the discovery of\npatterns, trends, and insights and then automatically acts on those dis\u00ad\ncoveries to create micro-targeted campaigns. Furthermore, it aids in the\nacceleration of the entire sales funnel by predicting which prospects will\nconvert, thereby optimising sales efforts.\nAI in business can gather and analyse large amounts of data, drive\nconsumer insights, and enable quick and efficient decision-making. AI\ncombined with big data, IoT, and the human brain has the potential to\nexpand the boundaries of marketing. AI allows businesses to collect\ndata, conduct more in-depth analyses, and take action based on practical\ninformation usage. AI may be the best investment in a professional\ncareer as a marketer.

Data is constantly\ncollected and utilised to drive future\nad content modifications. By\nleveraging personal and behavioural\ndata, AI will empower sellers to\nfocus more on outcomes and assist\ntheir clients. Psychographics will\nprovide more comprehensive\ninsights into the goals, desires, and\npurchasing patterns influencing\ncustomers\u2019 decisions to choose a\nproduct or service using AI.\nAI enables us to give clients\nintelligent, simple, and convenient\ncustomer support at every point in\ntheir journey. It is critical for a\nseamless and optimum consumer\nexperience. Marketing automation\napproaches are based on automating\nrepetitive marketing operations and\nactivities. AI applications in\nmarketing are especially important\nfor marketing automation. AI\ncaptures and interprets client data in\nreal-time using ML and applies those\nfindings on a vast scale. AI makes it\neasier to separate, sort, and prioritise\nthis data. AI-powered marketing\nautomation tools are revolutionising\nmarketing automation strategy.\nNext-generation platforms promise\nto boost marketing strategies by\naddressing shape-shifting needs such\nas hyper-personalised offerings for\nclients.\nAI helps marketers swiftly identify\nqualified leads, develop better\nnurturing tactics, and generate\nrelevant content when integrated\ninto marketing automation tools.\nDynamic content emails,\nparticularly one-on-one emails, are\nthe most effective because they use\ncontextual emails to energise what\nthe brand says while also targeting\nwhat subscribers are interested in\nhearing.

AI is a highly beneficial tool in content marketing and, quite\npossibly, the epicentre of content development\u2019s future. There is still\nmuch work before AI can function autonomously without human\nintervention. AI and humans can work together to significantly reduce\ncosts, increase efficiency, and boost organisational productivity. Incor\u00ad\nporating AI into traditionally organised analytics can open up a new\nuniverse of possibilities.

This is accomplished by understanding a\nbrand\u2019s voice through the data it collects and uses to train the AI. Deep\nlearning-powered AI generates email copy that resonates with customer\nsegments, individuals, and target audiences. This innovation can create\npersonalised email content recommendations on an individual level to\nincrease conversions and engagement. ML and AI are being used in\nbusiness and marketing. These technologies enable decision-makers to\nglean valuable insights from massive amounts of data, allowing com\u00ad\npanies to stay ahead of emerging trends. AI can help businesses navigate\nand analyse rapid market fluctuations, allowing them to optimise their\nproduct mix and predict trends.\nModern marketing depends on a deep understanding of customer\ndemands and preferences and the ability to act quickly and effectively\non that knowledge. Because of its ability to make real-time, data-driven\ndecisions, AI has gained traction among marketing stakeholders. How\u00ad\never, marketers must be cautious when deciding how to best integrate AI\ninto their campaigns and procedures. The research and application of AI\ntools are still in their infancy. As a result, a few concerns should be\nconsidered when incorporating AI into marketing. AI does not know\nwhich activities to perform to fulfil marketing goals. They will require\ntime and instruction to learn about the company\u2019s goals, customers\u2019\n\n[194\u2013197]\n\n[198\u2013200]\n\n[201\u2013204]\n\n127\n\n\fA.

When it comes to AI, this is a\nchallenge. Unless the technologies are expressly developed to follow\nparticular legal requirements, they may go beyond what is permissible\nwhen exploiting customer data for personalisation. AI in marketing is\ngrowing, but significant obstacles accompany it. AI is designed to sift\nthrough massive volumes of data and conduct a variety of computations.\nML and deep learning as AI components need sturdy hardware and a\nlarge computing capacity to run calculations fast. AI is no longer a\nrevolutionary concept among technology enthusiasts, researchers, and\nstudents. However, just a few individuals know AI\u2019s potential and\nbenefits.\nWhen it comes to AI, there are also significant competence dispar\u00ad\nities. Instead of being narrowed, these skill disparities are increasing.\nData science courses concentrating on AI development have grown more\ncommon despite a minor increase in interest in AI. However, more\nbrilliant individuals will be necessary to allow every firm to enter AI. For\nmany people, AI is still a novel technology. It will be difficult for them to\ndevelop faith in AI. People are hesitant to trust if they do not understand\nhow AI algorithms generate judgments. Suppose AI systems are not\ntrained on high-quality, timely, representative data. In that case, the tool\nwill make poor decisions not aligned with user preferences, reducing the\ninstrument\u2019s utility. Consumers and regulatory authorities are pushing\ndown on how businesses utilise their data.\n\nassistance so that systems can adjust their actions accordingly.\nIn the future, marketers can use AI to create personalised experiences\nfor their customers and develop marketing analytics techniques to target\npotential customers. . Every interaction a prospect or consumer has with\na product or solution is recorded and used to improve the product or\nservice in the future. There will be a better time for marketers to start\nexperimenting with AI strategies to help them create highly personalised\nexperiences for their customers. With AI poised to continue growing\nacross all industries and segments, marketers should dedicate time and\nresources to experiment with strategies and ensure their marketing\norganisation is set up for continued success, both now and in the future.\nConflict of interest\nNone.\nReferences\n[1] S.

Conclusion\nAI refers to techniques that allow machines to perform cognitive\nfunctions that require human intelligence. These include learning,\nreasoning, and interacting with the machine\u2019s surroundings. ML and\ndeep learning are two of the most well-known AI techniques. AI can\ncreate a more personalised brand experience, making cultivating user\nengagement and loyalty easier. Marketers use language-based AI as sales\ntools, payment processors, and engagement managers to improve the\nuser experience. Instead of figuring out the purchase process indepen\u00ad\ndently, customers can now rely on chatbots to do it for them. Languagebased AI is rapidly improving, \u201clearning\u201d from previous experiences and\nautomatically optimising to create an even better experience the next\ntime. It can assist marketers by identifying relevant content that users\nwant to read. Personalising content through observation, data collec\u00ad\ntion, and analysis is now possible with the help of AI. This technology in\ndigital marketing assists marketers with email campaigns, allowing\nthem to maximise results. Email marketing is one of the digital mar\u00ad\nketing services that help reach the target audience at the right time and\nensure relevant conversion strategies. Analysing data is the most critical\nadvantage of AI in marketing. This technology will analyse massive\namounts of data and provide marketers with real-world and actionable\ninsights.\n7. Future scope\nMarketers may use AI to evaluate consumer behaviours and patterns,\nanticipate future results, and adjust advertising appropriately. It uses\ndata, statistical algorithms, and cutting-edge AI technology to forecast\nfuture trends. As AI systems examine more data, they learn how to\nenhance their results and deliver the best answers over time. AI-powered\nML algorithms can analyse massive amounts of historical consumer data\nto identify which advertisements are appropriate for clients and at what\nstage of the purchasing process. AI will give marketers the optimisation\nbenefits of deploying content at the perfect moment by utilising trends\nand data. ML is a process that uses observations or data, such as direct\nexperience, or instruction, to recognise patterns in data that allow you to\nmake better decisions in the future. ML aims to enable computers to\nlearn automatically \u201con their own,\u201d without human intervention or\n128\n\n\fA.

This corporate behaviour, defined as machinewashing, in an attempt to empower engagement processes in the stakeholders\u2019 network\nand satisfy stakeholder expectations with regard to the ethical implications of the use of\nlevels of corporate performance and reputation. However, thus far, scholars have not\nprovided any empirical studies on the existence of corporate machinewashing strategies, and there is a significant lack of clarity as to how to measure machinewashing.\nUtilising the corporate digital responsibility theory, this paper offers an original methodological contribution to the nascent research field dedicated to machinewashing behaviour. Particularly, this paper provides considerations for detecting machinewashing\nthrough an analysis based on the comparison between the information capacity of the\nreporting and the information reliability level as a proxy for machinewashing strategies\nand, thus, for the real impact of digitalisation strategies on stakeholders. To this end, we\nconducted an exploratory content analysis of the reports of 10 Italian-\u00adlisted companies\nfrom 10 different industries. Overall, looking at the gap between what companies say\nabout the impact of digitalisation from an ethical perspective, and what really happens,\nour results define a possible path for identifying machinewashing, the fields where it\nhappens and the practices that companies use in order to realise these strategies.\nKEYWORDS\n\ncorporate digital responsibility, digital ethics, exploratory content analysis, machinewashing,\nstakeholder engagement\n\n1\n\n|\n\nI NTRO D U C TI O N\n\nnegative effects of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) (Haenlein\net al., 2022; Haenlein & Kaplan, 2020).

However, it remains unclear whether consumers' social and\nproduct preferences may be shaped by the identity labels generated by the platform, depending on the source of these labels\n(i.e., whether identity labels are generated by algorithms or humans). Three studies covering different scenarios involving\nvarious identity labels and their corresponding identity\u2010consistent products show that algorithm\u2010generated (vs. human\u2010\ngenerated) identity labels enhance consumers' preferences for identity\u2010consistent products. We further demonstrate that this\neffect occurs because consumers exposed to algorithm\u2010generated identity labels exhibit a heightened expected accuracy of\nalgorithmic predictions and a stronger strength of identification, which subsequently fosters their identity\u2010consistent product\npreferences. Our findings advance the understanding of consumer responses to algorithm\u2010generated information and offer\nvaluable insights for companies to leverage algorithmic technology to nudge consumer behavior.\n\n1 | Introduction\nIdentities play a critical role in shaping consumers' social cognition, particularly in relation to self\u2010esteem, signaling their\nunique characteristics, and gaining recognition and connection\nwith others (Brewer 1991; Kaikati et al. 2017). Recently, the\nadvancement of digitalization has enabled marketers to attract\nconsumer interest and help consumers make better decisions by\nlabeling their identities based on factors such as demographic,\nbehavioral, and psychological information (Ramsay 2023; Reed\net al. 2012). For example, Airbnb labels consumers' travel\nidentities by utilizing personalized data, including personality\ntest responses and specific travel histories (Airbnb 2017). Similarly, Starbucks tailors its coffee recommendations based\non consumers' MBTI (Myers\u2010Briggs Type Indicator) labels\n(DeVries 2016). By engaging in marketing tactics involving\n\nidentity labels, companies facilitate consumers' self\u2010recognition\nand enjoyment during their consumption and thus foster consumers' emotional connections and resonance with the brand\n(Papaoikonomou, Cascon\u2010Pereira, and Ryan 2016). Also, identity labels can spark consumers' brand responses, including a\ngreater willingness to get involved in brand\u2010initiated activities\nand to interact with the brand posting content on social media\n(Agogu\u00e9 and Parguel 2020; Dinhopl, Gretzel, and Whelan 2015).\nWhile extant research has identified the various effects of\nidentity labels on brand perceptions (Cornelissen et al. 2007;\nSummers, Smith, and Reczek 2016), the extent to which the\ncharacteristics of these identity labels may in turn affect consumers' subsequent product preferences and choices remains\nrelatively understudied. In this research, we focus on a significant and commonplace factor\u2014the source of identity labels\u2014\n\n\u00a9 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025; 1\u201313\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/mar.22195\n\n1 of 13\n\n\f2 of 13\n\nPerfume\nHousing\nCartoon\nFood\nFurniture retailer\nHair care product\nSample of labels\n\nCoffee\nProduct\n\nSocial\npersonality test\nTravel\npersonality quiz\nSocial\npersonality test\nSocial\npersonality test\nPersonality quiz\nPersonality quiz\nSocial\npersonality test\nInformation\nanalyzed\n\nFlavor profile\nTravel personality\nSocial personality\nFlavor profile\nConsumer\npersonality\nConsumers\npersonality\nContent of labels\n\nHair personality\n\nPinrose\nAirbnb\nDisney\nKnorr\nDFS\nP&G\nStarbucks\nCompany\n\nExamples of companies employing algorithm\u2010generated identity labels.\n|\n\nTo fill this gap, the present research explores whether and how\nthe source of identity labels may interact with consumer preferences for identity\u2010consistent products. Specifically, we argue\nthat consumers are more likely to purchase identity\u2010consistent\nproducts when exposed to algorithm\u2010generated identity labels\n(vs. human\u2010generated identity labels). Given humans' inherent\nsubjectivity and intentionality associated with human\u2010\ngenerated identity labels, consumers may perceive human\u2010\ngenerated information as potentially biased and inaccurate\n(Lewis and Sherman 2003). In contrast, algorithm\u2010generated\ninformation is often perceived as more objective and accurate\n(Longoni and Cian 2022), and consumers generally have higher\nexpectations of algorithms' capability to produce objective and\naccurate content (Von Walter, Kremmel, and J\u00e4ger 2022).\nConsequently, we hypothesize that when consumers receive\nidentity labels generated by algorithms, the heightened expected accuracy of algorithmic predictions will enhance their\nidentification with such labels, thereby enhancing their preference for identity\u2010consistent products. As a corollary for this\ntheorization, we also predict that this effect will diminish when\n\nTABLE 1\n\nExtant research has systematically examined consumer\nresponses to algorithm\u2010generated information, particularly\nconcerning market\u2010driven information. (e.g., product recommendation, service, advice, content of promotion) generated by\nalgorithms that facilitate consumers' decision\u2010making processes\n(e.g., Arango, Singaraju, and Niininen 2023; Kim, Giroux, and\nLee 2021; Longoni and Cian 2022). The content of this information is primarily determined by market\u2010relevant elements,\nsuch as marketing communications, social influences, and\nproduct availability (Jia, Ouyang, et al. 2024). However, there\nalso exists a type of information that is inherently derived and\nconstructed by consumers (i.e., individual characteristics) and is\ngenerally less susceptible to external market influences\n(Oyserman 2009). Given the extensive exploration of consumer\nresponses to algorithm\u2010generated market\u2010driven information,\nthere is a paucity of research on how consumers react to\nalgorithm\u2010generated information driven by consumers per se\n(i.e., consumer\u2010driven information). As a typical factor of\nconsumer\u2010driven information, identity labels help clarify the\ncategories to which consumers belong based on their information and help them define who they are (Reed et al. 2012).\nDespite this, scant research has explored how consumers react\nto identity labels generated by external sources, such as algorithms and humans. Additionally, it is unclear whether consumers may respond differently toward identity labels\ndepending on their sources (i.e., algorithm\u2010generated identity\nlabels vs. human\u2010generated identity labels).\n\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22195 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

More importantly, with the rapid proliferation of\ndigitalization and the widespread application of algorithmic\ntechnologies, an increasing number of companies are moving\nbeyond traditional human sources (e.g., consultants, company\nstaff, friends, and family members) for generating identity labels\nand are instead employing algorithms to generate consumers'\nidentity labels (see Table 1 for examples in the marketplaces).\nDespite its ubiquity, whether algorithm\u2010generated identity\nlabels can indeed outperform human\u2010generated identity labels\nin influencing consumer behavior has also yet to be explored.\n\n\fThe present investigation offers several important theoretical\nimplications. First, it advances the growing literature on consumer responses to algorithm\u2010generated information. In contrast to the majority of previous research focusing on market\u2010\ndriven information (e.g., Huang and Rust 2024; Xie et al. 2022),\nour research uncovers how consumer\u2010driven information (i.e.,\nidentity labels) generated by algorithms can in turn influence\nconsumers themselves. Meanwhile, by examining consumers'\nperception of algorithmic information and its impact on self\u2010\nidentification and subsequent behavior, this study advances our\nunderstanding of consumers' lay beliefs about algorithms.\nMoreover, it contributes to the identity literature by focusing on\nexternal factors instead of internal attributes that can\nstrengthen consumers' self\u2010identification. Previous research has\nextensively discussed how individuals' inherent characteristics\ninfluence their self\u2010identification, such as the need for\nuniqueness and the need for self\u2010expression (Chan, Berger, and\nVan Boven 2012). This study, however, uncovers an important\nand prevalent external factor (i.e., source of identity labels) that\nmay affect consumers' self\u2010identification and subsequent\nbehavior through heightened expected accuracy of algorithmic\npredictions.\nPractically, our findings align with recent movements urging\npractitioners to strategically leverage the advantages of algorithmic technology to shape consumer behavior (Guha\net al. 2021; Querci et al. 2022). Nevertheless, our examination of\nthe boundary conditions\u2014such as the algorithm's potential\nlimitations\u2014also highlights the prerequisites for benefiting\nfrom algorithm\u2010generated identity labels: When consumers are\naware of the possible inaccuracies in algorithms, the effectiveness of these algorithms as a source of identity labels in influencing consumer behavior will be reduced.\n\nalgorithm\u2010generated market\u2010driven information, including recommended products, price offers, promotional strategies, and\nretailing services (McCarthy, Shapiro, and Perreault 1979). As\nsuch, significantly less attention has been paid to algorithm\u2010\ngenerated information internally derived by consumers rather\nthan externally assigned by companies or markets. Unlike\nmarket\u2010driven information focusing on products, prices, promotions, and places (i.e., 4Ps), consumer\u2010driven information\npredominantly consists of personalized information about\nconsumers themselves, such as demographics, social networks,\nrisk preferences, and other personal attributes (Chernev,\nHamilton, and Gal 2011). Consumer\u2010driven information encompasses consumers' subjective and inherent information and\ncan fluctuate due to external factors such as time, consumption\ncontext, and influence of others (Gollwitzer et al. 2009). As a\nresult, consumer\u2010driven information is often more complex and\nuncertain compared to market\u2010driven information.\nIt is crucial for consumers to understand their identity and the\ngroup they belong to, highlighting the significance of identity\nlabels (Reed et al. 2012) as a key piece of consumer\u2010driven\ninformation. Meanwhile, identity labels help consumers foster\nresponses to companies, brands, and products (Dinhopl,\nGretzel, and Whelan 2015). As shown in Table 2, consumers\ntend to exhibit mixed responses to different types of algorithm\u2010\ngenerated information. However, there still remains a lack of\nresearch on whether algorithm\u2010generated identity labels elicit\npositive or negative consumer responses.\n\n2.2 | Heightened Expected Accuracy of\nAlgorithmic Predictions and Self\u2010Identification\nWith Algorithm\u2010Generated Information\n\nAlgorithmic tools have been extensively employed to substitute\nhuman agents in generating information to serve consumers in\nvarious fields such as finance, healthcare, tourism, and retail\nservices. For example, algorithmic tools can generate product\nrecommendations (Xie et al. 2022), provide medical advice\n(Longoni, Bonezzi, and Morewedge 2019), and even offer critical suggestions on moral\u2010related decisions (Dietvorst and\nBartels 2022). Extant evidence suggests that all else being equal,\nonce consumers realize that the source of information is an\nalgorithm rather than a human, their subsequent psychological\nand behavioral responses to that information can differ significantly (see Table 2 for a summary).\n\nIndividuals develop lay beliefs grounded in subjective, informal,\nand implicit cognitive and commonsensical explanations of\nthemselves and the surrounding world (Molden and\nDweck 2006). With the widespread application of algorithmic\ntechnology, when consumers receive information generated by\nalgorithms, compared to traditional human\u2010generated information, they hold different lay beliefs about algorithms and\nhumans (Kim et al. 2022; Longoni and Cian 2022; Shen and\nJin 2024). Notably, research on individuals' lay perceptions of\nalgorithms indicates that consumers generally believe that algorithms have superior analytical abilities than humans, such\nas solving numerical problems (Shen and Jin 2024), processing\nnew information (Kim et al. 2022), and logical reasoning\n(Longoni and Cian 2022). Algorithms are often seen as having\nless agency than humans, leading people to believe that they are\nless likely to make subjective judgments or exhibit biases. As a\nresult, algorithms are generally perceived as more rational and\nobjective (Kim et al. 2022). Von Walter et al. (2022) introduce\nthe concept of \u201cexpected accuracy of algorithmic prediction,\u201d\nhighlighting consumers' beliefs about the objectivity and reliability of predictions made by algorithms. They also explore\nhow this heightened expectation of accuracy shapes consumers'\nsubsequent behaviors from an implicit perspective.\n\nAs illustrated in Table 2, extant literature has predominantly\nfocused on investigating consumers' heterogeneous responses to\n\nWithin the context of identity labeling, the source of identity\nlabels predicts identities based on consumers' psychological\n\n2 | Conceptual Foundations and Hypotheses\n2.1 | Consumer Responses to Algorithm\u2010\nGenerated Identity Labels\n\n3 of 13\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22195 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

Consequently,\nindividuals can self\u2010identify with (or contrast themselves\nagainst) virtually any conceivable identity label. However,\nnot all identities are integral to consumers' self\u2010definition,\nleading to identity crises and self\u2010concept confusion (Jiang,\nChen, and Sedikides 2020). In marketing contexts, consumers' self\u2010identification can fluctuate in response to external factors, such as affirmation from others (Reed\net al. 2012). The recent advancements in digitalization have\nsignificantly increased consumers' access to external information, with identity labels serving as an effective approach\nto activate and enhance consumers' self\u2010identification\n(Dinhopl, Gretzel, and Whelan 2015). For example, when\ncar owners are labeled as \u201cenvironmentalists,\u201d their self\u2010\nidentification increases, leading to a greater willingness to\noffer carpooling services on sharing platforms (Hartl,\nKamleitner, and Holub 2020). Marketers can also leverage\nbehavioral targeting by communicating identity labels to\nsubtly influence consumer preferences without explicitly\nlabeling information (Summers, Smith, and Reczek 2016).\nConceptually, strength of identification is defined as individuals' perceived association and similarity between their\nsense of selves and their identities (Forehand, Deshpand\u00e9, and\nReed 2002). A stronger strength of identification is generally\nmore effective in influencing consumers' subsequent perceptions and behaviors, as indicated by higher levels of consumer\nattention and an increased willingness to purchase identity\u2010\nconsistent products (Donthu and Cherian 1994; Kettle and\nH\u00e4ubl 2011). As a consequence of the aforementioned heightened expected accuracy of algorithmic predictions (vs. human\npredictions), consumers who receive the identity label from an\nalgorithm (vs. a human) may exhibit a stronger strength of\nidentification, which can subsequently enhance their preferences for identity\u2010consistent products. Formally, we\nhypothesize:\n\nH1. The source of identity labels (algorithm vs. human) affects\nconsumers' identity\u2010consistent product preferences: When the\nidentity label is generated by an algorithm (vs. a human),\nconsumers are more willing to purchase identity\u2010consistent\nproducts.\n\nH2. The heightened expected accuracy of algorithmic\npredictions and strength of identification serially mediate the\neffect of source of identity labels (algorithm vs. human) on\nconsumers' preferences for identity\u2010consistent products.\n\n2.3 | Moderating Role of the Reminder of\nAlgorithm Inaccuracy\nTo recap, the proposed effect of the source of identity labels on\nconsumers' preferences for identity\u2010consistent products is\ndriven by consumers' stronger strength of identification with\nthe identity label, which is triggered by the heightened expected\naccuracy of algorithmic predictions. If the core of our prediction\nis consumers' lay belief about algorithms' capability to generate\naccurate identity labels, it is reasonable to predict that the main\neffect will attenuate when this lay belief is challenged. Prior\nstudies have demonstrated that consumers' lay beliefs about\nalgorithms are vulnerable. For instance, consumers' belief that\nalgorithms are less talented than humans for handling hedonic\ntasks can be alleviated when algorithms are described as\n\u201caugmented intelligence\u201d supporting humans (Longoni and\nCian 2022). Also, consumers' lay belief that algorithms are more\nadept at making accurate offers in negotiations can be diminished when they are reminded of the risk of being exploited by\nalgorithms (Shen and Jin 2024).\nAccording to our theorization, the underlying mechanism for\nthe effect of algorithm\u2010generated identity labels is heightened\nexpected accuracy of algorithmic predictions. When consumers\nare reminded that algorithms can make mistakes and may be\ninaccurate, their belief in algorithms' higher accuracy for generating identity labels is challenged, leading them to view algorithms as potentially unreliable. Hence, we predict that the\nreminder of algorithms' potential inaccuracy will decrease their\nlikelihood of purchasing identity\u2010consistent products. To summarize, we propose the following hypothesis:\n\nH3. The effect of the source of identity labels (algorithm vs.\nhuman) on consumers' identity\u2010consistent product preferences is\nattenuated when consumers are presented with the reminder of\nalgorithm inaccuracy.\n\n3 | Overview of Studies\nWe conducted three incentive\u2010compatible studies to test\nwhether, why, and when the source of identity labels (algorithm\nor human) affects consumers' identity\u2010consistent product preferences. Study 1 tests the main effect that the identity label\ngenerated by algorithms (vs. humans) can increase consumers'\nrelative choice for identity\u2010consistent products (H1). Study 2\nexplores the underlying mechanism by testing the heightened\nexpected accuracy of algorithmic predictions and strength of\nidentification as serial mediators (H2). Study 3 examines the\nboundary condition by showing that the proposed main effect is\ndiminished when the algorithm is reminded as potentially\ninaccurate (H3). Figure 1 illustrates the research model tested\nin this paper. We pre\u2010registered all three studies, determined\nthe sample size using G*Power, and set the exclusion criteria\n5 of 13\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22195 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

Hence,\nconsumers may perceive that human\u2010based identity labeling\nincorporates subjective judgments and intentionality (Lewis\nand Sherman 2003), leading to questions about the accuracy\nand credibility of such labels. In contrast, when the identity\nlabel is generated by algorithms, consumers tend to perceive\nthese labels as more rational and objective, with fewer\nconcerns about potential biases. When consumers' expected\naccuracy of algorithmic predictions is heightened, they are\nmore likely to believe that algorithm\u2010generated (vs. human\u2010\ngenerated) identity predictions can more accurately capture\ntheir true selves. Therefore, their perceived alignment and\ncongruence between their self\u2010concept and their identities\nare enhanced.\n\n\f| Research model.\n\nbefore the collection of data1. We also report detailed measures\nand manipulations across all studies.\n\n4 | Study 1: Main Effect of the Source of Identity\nLabels\nStudy 1 aims to provide initial behavioral evidence pertaining to\nthe impact of the source of identity labels (algorithm vs.\nhuman) on consumers' preferences for identity\u2010consistent\nproducts (H1). Specifically, we focus on consumers' dietary\nhabits, testing whether they are more likely to choose identity\u2010\nconsistent products when receiving algorithm\u2010generated identity labels (vs. human\u2010generated identity labels) in an incentive\u2010\ncompatible paradigm.\n\n4.1 | Method and Procedure\nThis study employed a two\u2010conditions (source of identity label:\nalgorithm vs. human) between\u2010subjects design. A total of 350\nU.S. participants who were interested in purchasing beverages\nwere recruited from CloudResearch (MAge = 38.31, SD = 11.98,\n48.3% female) for a small monetary compensation. We informed\nparticipants that we would randomly select 10 of them to\nreceive an extra voucher (worth $5) that can be redeemed for\nthe product of their choice. This incentive\u2010compatible procedure has been well\u2010validated in recent consumer behavioral\nliterature (Jia, Wan, and Zheng 2023; Yin and Huang 2022).\n\ndietary habits (e.g., \u201cTo what extent do you agree with this\nopinion \u2018Eating healthy food is more important to me than\nindulgence/enjoying the food.\u2019\u201d; adapted from Hallit\net al. 2021). Afterward, the algorithm (or the consultant,\ndepending on the condition to which participants belong)\nwould generate corresponding habit labels (i.e., \u201cExpert dieter\u201d\nor \u201cIntuitive eater\u201d) based on their responses (see Appendix A).\nAmong the two labels, \u201cExpert dieter\u201d prioritizes healthy eating\nwhile \u201cIntuitive eater\u201d focuses more on enjoying delicious food\nwithout regard for its healthiness.\nParticipants then proceeded to the second task, where they were\nintroduced to two beverages available on Amazon. One beverage was more delicious but had higher sugar and calorie content, while the other had healthier ingredients but was less\nflavorful (adapted from Szathvary and Trestini 2014). Next,\nparticipants answered their relative choice between the two\nbeverages (\u201cIf you have a beverage voucher, which beverage\nwould you prefer to redeem\u201d; adapted from Jia, Wan, and\nZheng 2023) and completed the manipulation check question\n(\u201cWhether you think the agent that conversed with you and\ngenerated the label for you was an algorithm or a human\n(human/algorithm)?\u201d). At the conclusion, participants provided\ndemographic information (i.e., gender, age) and received compensation. We randomly selected 10 participants to receive a $5\nvoucher, which could be used on the Amazon platform to\nredeem their beverage of choice.\n\n4.2 | Results and Discussion\nAs a cover story, we invited participants to complete two\nostensibly unrelated tasks. In the first task, all participants were\ninvited to take part in a test on dietary habits, where they\nneeded to answer several questions about their dietary attitudes\nand preferences. We randomly assigned participants to one of\ntwo conditions (source of identity label: algorithm vs. human).\nIn the algorithm condition, we informed the participants that\nan intelligent algorithmic agent would engage in a conversation\nwith them and make the identity label based on the participants' responses, while those in the human condition were told\nthat a professional consultant would converse with them and\npredict the identity label for them based on their responses. All\nparticipants entered a dialog interface to converse with either\nan algorithmic agent or a human consultant. During the conversation, they responded to four questions pertaining to their\n6 of 13\n\nManipulation check. In the algorithm condition, 93.1% of participants believed that the label was made by an algorithmic\nagent. In comparison, 82.4% of participants in the human\u2010label\ncondition believed that the label was made by a human\n( \u03c7 2 (1) = 201.58, p < 0.001), validating the success of the source\nof identity label manipulation.\nConsumers' preferences for identity\u2010consistent products. We conducted a crosstab analysis to confirm the effect of the source of\nthe identity label (0 = human, 1 = algorithm) on consumers'\nproduct choice (0 = identity\u2010inconsistent product, 1 = identity\u2010\nconsistent product)2. As predicted, the results revealed that\n82.2% of the participants in the algorithm condition chose the\nidentity\u2010consistent product, indicating a stronger preference for\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22195 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

Compared to human\u2010generated labels, labels\nmade by algorithms can more effectively nudge consumers to\nchoose products that are consistent with their identity labels. In\nthe following two experiments, we further test the underlying\nmechanism of the proposed effect.\n\n5 | Study 2: Serial Mediation Effect\nTo further explore the mechanism underlying the impact of the\nsource of identity labels (algorithm vs. human) on consumers'\npreferences for identity\u2010consistent products, we measure and\ntest consumers' expected accuracy of algorithms and strength of\nidentification as serial mediators (H2). Meanwhile, we aim to\nextend the proposed effect to a new scenario (i.e., investment\nscenario) in an incentive\u2010compatible paradigm (Li and\nYan 2021), which involves risk preference identity labels for\nconsumers and measures of their subsequent risk\u2010taking\nbehavior in an investment game.\n\ninvest the entire 10 RMB of their reward into the game and\nearned an extra 10 RMB in profit, they would ultimately receive\na total bonus of 20 RMB.\nTo explore the potential mechanism, we also measured participants' expected accuracy of algorithmic (or human) predictions and their strength of identification. Specifically, the\nheightened expected accuracy of algorithmic (or human) predictions was measured with three\u2010item scales (adapted from\nVon Walter, Kremmel, and J\u00e4ger 2022; Wixom and Todd 2005;\n\u03b1 = 0.77). The strength of identification was measured using a\nthree\u2010items scale adapted from Donthu and Cherian (1994)\n(\u03b1 = 0.68; for all the measured items, see Appendix D).\nAs in Study 1, participants answered the manipulation check\nquestion (i.e., \u201cWhether you think the agent that conversed\nwith you and generated the label for you was an algorithm or a\nhuman (algorithm/human)?\u201d) and the demographic questions\n(i.e., gender, age). In addition to the basic compensation for\nparticipation, we also randomly selected 10 participants to\nreceive extra rewards based on the amount they chose to invest\nin the slot game. The final reward was distributed to these\nparticipants based on their earnings from the game, as well as\nthe money not invested in the game.\n\n5.1 | Method and Procedure\n\n5.2 | Results and Discussion\n\nA total of 350 Chinese participants (MAge = 30.78, SD = 7.35,\n72.0% female) who were interested in financial investment were\nrecruited from Credamo to participate in the experiment for a\nsmall monetary compensation. Similar to the procedures of\nStudy 1, participants were invited to have a conversation with\neither an intelligent algorithmic agent or a professional consultant. Participants needed to answer three questions about\ntheir investment preferences from either the algorithmic agent\nor the consultant (e.g., \u201cDo you prefer to avoid risks in your\nlife?\u201d; adapted from Meertens and Lion 2008). Then, they\nreceived the identity label generated based on their responses,\n\u201cConservative investor\u201d or \u201cAdventurous investor,\u201d which\ncorrespond to low\u2010risk investment preference and high\u2010risk\ninvestment preferences, respectively (see Appendix B).\n\nManipulation check. In the algorithm condition, 97.70% of\nparticipants believed that the label was made by an algorithmic\nagent, while 97.10% of participants in the human condition\nbelieved that the label was made by a human ( \u03c7 2 (1) = 314.94,\np < 0.001), validating the success of the source of identity label\nmanipulation.\n\nIn the second task, participants were then presented with a slot\ngame. After viewing the webpage of the slot game, participants\nanswered the question, \u201cSuppose you have 10 RMB, how much\nwould you spend on this online slot game? (adapted from Li and\nYan 2021)\u201d. To ensure the design was incentive\u2010compatible,\nparticipants were informed that we would randomly select 10 of\nthem to receive an extra reward worth 10 RMB in total. They\nalso learned that they could choose to invest a portion of their\nreward into the slot game, indicating their risk preference by\nsliding the marker along the scale from 0 to 10, with intervals of\n2 RMB. A larger amount of money participants would like to\ninvest indicated a higher risk\u2010taking preference. Based on the\nidentity label assigned to each participant, we then utilized risk\u2010\ntaking behavior as a proxy for their preference for identity\u2010\nconsistent products3. We will calculate their final reward based\non their game earnings, plus their principal and any money not\ninvested in the game. For example, if a participant chose to\n\nConsumers' preferences for identity\u2010consistent products. We conducted an independent t\u2010test analysis to test the main effect of\nthe source of identity label (0 = human, 1 = algorithm) on\nconsumers' preference for identity\u2010consistent products. In line\nwith Study 1, we found that consumers showed higher preferences for the slot game when the identity label was made by an\nalgorithm (M = 5.58, SD = 2.97) than when it was generated by\na human (M = 4.91, SD = 2.73; t(348) = 2.18, p = 0.030).\nSerial mediation analysis. We also tested a serial mediation\nanalysis in which the source of identity label was the independent variable, heightened expected accuracy of algorithmic\npredictions and strength of identification were the first\nand second mediators (sequentially input), and participants'\npreference for identity\u2010consistent products was the dependent\nvariable (Model 6; Hayes 2017). The indirect pathway of the\neffect of the source of identity labels on identity\u2010consistent\nproduct preference via the heightened expected accuracy of\nalgorithmic predictions and the strength of identification was\nsignificant (B = 0.21, SE = 0.11, 95% CI: [0.0251, 0.4423]). The\ninsignificant direct effect (B = 0.36, SE = 0.32, 95% CI: [\u22120.2719,\n0.9859]) indicated that these pathways fully mediated the\noverall impact of source of identity label on identity\u2010consistent\nproduct preference (see Figure 2). We also tested the possibility\nof reverse causality by testing an alternative model in which the\n7 of 13\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22195 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

The results revealed that when the\nsequence of the two mediators was reversed, the serial mediation did not reach significance (B = 0.03, SE = 0.08, 95% CI:\n[\u22120.1264, 0.1889]).\nStudy 2 provides a direct theory test by showing that consumers'\nheightened expected accuracy of algorithmic prediction and the\nstrength of identification sequentially mediate the proposed\neffect of the source of identity label (algorithm vs. human) on\nidentity\u2010consistent product preferences (H2). Besides offering\nmechanism evidence, Study 2 also extends the main effect of the\nsource of identity labels on product preferences in the domain\nof risk investment. On the other hand, one may wonder\nwhether the advantages of algorithms in generating identity\nlabels are applicable in all situations or if there are certain\nboundary conditions. We thus carried out the following Study 3\nto identify a theoretically motivated moderator.\n\n6 | Study 3: Moderating Role of the Reminder of\nAlgorithm Inaccuracy\nStudy 3 examines the underlying mechanism of consumers'\nexpected accuracy of algorithms using a process\u2010by\u2010moderation\napproach (Spencer, Zanna, and Fong 2005). If the strengthened\nexpectancy that algorithm\u2010generated labels are more accurate\nindeed underlies the promoting effect of algorithms as sources\nof identity labels, then once this belief is challenged, the\nobserved heightened preference for identity\u2010consistent products\nshould diminish (H3). Study 3 tests this possibility in a new\nproduct consumption scenario (i.e., using the USB flash drive\nfor data storage as the focal product) through an incentive\u2010\ncompatible design.\n\n6.1 | Method and Procedure\nA total of 450 Chinese participants (MAge = 30.11, SD = 8.22,\n73.6% female) who were interested in purchasing electronic\nproducts were recruited from Credamo for a small monetary\ncompensation. We invited participants to have a personality test\n8 of 13\n\nand employed a 3 (source of identity label: algorithm vs.\nreminder of algorithm inaccuracy vs. human) between\u2010subjects\ndesign. In this study, we utilized a creativity personality test,\nlabeling consumers as either \u201cInnovator\u201d or \u201cConservative\u201d\nbased on their responses. Existing research has validated that\nconsumers who pursue innovation are more inclined to choose\nproducts with novel designs, while those who prioritize conservatism and practical value favor products with strengthened\nutility functions (Oyserman and Schwarz 2017).\nFollowing the procedures of Studies 1 and 2, all participants\nfirst finished a test by having three rounds of conversation with\neither an intelligent algorithmic agent or a professional consultant (e.g., \u201cWhich of the following statements do you agree\nwith?\u201d; adapted from Gough 1979; see Appendix C). We also\nincluded a \u201creminder of algorithm inaccuracy\u201d condition, in\nwhich we informed participants that the algorithm might make\nmistakes and may encounter inaccuracy issues (see Appendix\nC). After reading the instructions and answering the test\nquestions, they received the identity label generated either by\nan algorithm or by a consultant, labeled as either \u201cInnovator\u201d or\n\u201cConservative,\u201d based on their responses during the personality test.\nSubsequently, participants proceeded to the second task and\nwere presented with two types of USB flash drives. One USB\ndrive features a more innovative design but has a relatively\nslower transfer speed, while the other USB drive offers a faster\ntransfer speed with a more conventional and mainstream\ndesign (adapted from Wen Wan, Peng Chen, and Jin 2017).\nParticipants then reported their identity\u2010consistent product\npreferences by answering their relative choice between the two\nUSB drives (\u201cIf you have a voucher, which USB driver would\nyou prefer to redeem?\u201d; adapted from Jia, Wan, and\nZheng 2023). To make this study incentive\u2010compatible, participants were informed that we would randomly select 10 of\nthem to receive an additional voucher valued at 10 RMB, which\ncould be used to purchase their chosen USB drive.\nAfterward, participants completed a manipulation check question regarding the source of the identity labels: \u201cDo you think\nthe agent that conversed with you and generated the label for\nyou was an algorithm or a human (human/algorithm)?\u201d.

This suggests that the effect of algorithm\u2010generated\nlabels is contingent upon consumers' lay perception that the\nalgorithmic predictions are accurate. Once consumers are\naware of algorithms' potential inaccuracy, the advantage of algorithms in nudging consumers' preference for identity\u2010\nconsistent products will be diminished.\n\n7 | General Discussion\n6.2 | Results and Discussion\nManipulation check. As expected, 98.3% of participants thought\nthat they received algorithm\u2010generated labels in the algorithm\ncondition. In contrast, 98.0% of participants believed that they\nreceived human\u2010generated labels in the human condition\n( \u03c7 2 (1) = 414.76, p < 0.001), validating the manipulation of the\nsource of identity label. For the manipulation of algorithm\naccuracy, participants in the reminder of the algorithm\ninaccuracy condition reported greater awareness of the\ninaccuracy of algorithms (M = 4.87, SD = 1.51) than those in the\nalgorithm condition (M = 3.28, SD = 1.32; t(299) = 9.74,\np < 0.001).\nConsumers' preferences for identity\u2010consistent products. We conducted a logistic regression on participants' choice between the\ntwo USB drivers (0 = identity\u2010inconsistent product,\n1 = identity\u2010consistent product) after the manipulation of the\nsource of identity label (i.e., algorithm vs. reminder of algorithm\ninaccuracy vs. human)4. The logistic regression yielded a significant main effect, suggesting that consumers' choice of\nidentity\u2010consistent products varied across the three conditions\n(\u03b2 = 0.31, p = 0.039). In particular, participants in the algorithm\ncondition were more likely to choose the identity\u2010consistent\nproduct (87.3%) than those in the human condition (77.9%;\n\u03c7 2 (1) = 4.68, p = 0.031), replicating the main effect. However,\nwhen participants were aware of the inaccuracy of the algorithm, they were less likely to choose an identity\u2010consistent\nproduct (76.2%) than participants in the algorithm condition\n(87.3%; \u03c7 2 (1) = 6.29, p = 0.012). See Figure 3 for illustration.\nTo recap, the results of Study 3 demonstrate that the influence\nof the source of identity label (algorithm vs. human) on\nidentity\u2010consistent product preferences was weakened when\nparticipants were reminded of the potential inaccuracy of the\n\nFIGURE 3\n(Study 3).\n\n| Moderating role of reminder of algorithm inaccuracy\n\nAs humans, a fundamental motivation is to seek identities\nrepresenting the groups they belong to. Therefore, companies\ngenerate identity labels for consumers to fulfill their motivation\nfor identities and self\u2010identification (Dinhopl, Gretzel, and\nWhelan 2015; Hartl, Kamleitner, and Holub 2020). Traditionally, identity labels are generated by humans, while the development of digitalization and social media has enabled\nalgorithms to generate identity labels in a more efficient manner (Airbnb 2017). In this article, we emphasize the importance\nof the source of identity labels and find that algorithm\u2010\ngenerated (vs. human\u2010generated) information can heighten\nconsumers' expected accuracy of algorithmic predictions and\nbetter activate their strength of identification (Study 2) and thus\nfoster consumers' preferences for identity\u2010consistent products\n(Studies 1\u20133). Conversely, the effect is diminished when consumers are reminded of the potential inaccuracy of algorithms\n(Study 3).\n\n7.1 | Theoretical Implications\nThe current research makes significant contributions to the\nextant literature as a first step to explore the consequences of\nalgorithm\u2010generated consumer\u2010driven information. Numerous\nstudies have investigated the influence of algorithm\u2010generated\nmarket\u2010driven information in various service domains on consumer responses, such as consumer trust, satisfaction, advice\u2010\ntaking behavior, and product preferences (Longoni, Bonezzi,\nand Morewedge 2019; Sands et al. 2022). While information\ndriven by external market factors is pervasive in daily lives,\nanother relatively overlooked but important type of\ninformation\u2014those determined by consumers themselves\u2014can\nhelp consumers gain a deeper understanding of their own\nidentities (Reed et al. 2012). In this research, we focus on the\nidentity label as a type of consumer\u2010driven information used by\ncompanies as a marketing strategy to capture consumer attention and help consumers' decision\u2010making. Notably, our\nresearch tests consumer responses beyond consumer preferences for the algorithm\u2010generated information per se. Instead,\nwe examine how algorithm\u2010generated information, specifically\nalgorithm\u2010generated identity labels, influences consumers'\nsubsequent preferences for identity\u2010consistent products after\nreceiving identity labels generated by algorithms.\nThis work also contributes to the identity literature by considering how external factors (e.g., source of identity label) can\ninfluence consumer behavior by increasing consumers' expected accuracy of algorithmic predictions and strength of\nidentification. As prior research has provided clear evidence of\nthe internal formation process of self\u2010identification and\n9 of 13\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22195 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nalgorithm inaccuracy condition also answered the question \u201cTo\nwhat extent are you aware that algorithms may also be\ninaccurate (1 = not at all, 7 = very much)?\u201d. Finally, participants provided demographic information (i.e., gender, age) and\nreceived compensation. At the conclusion of the study, 10\nrandomly selected participants also received extra vouchers that\ncould be redeemed for their chosen products.\n\n\fIn doing so, our work also enriches the understanding of enhancing the positive effects of identity labeling. Prior research\nhas well documented a range of factors that can influence the\neffectiveness of identity labels on consumer cognition and\nconsumer behavior (Chan, Berger, and Van Boven 2012;\nCornelissen et al. 2007). By exploring the source of identity\nlabels as a novel influencing factor, our research indicates that\nthe characteristics of identity labels can also influence the\neffectiveness of the identity label. Nevertheless, we examined\nthe mechanism through mediation and moderation analyses\n(Preacher and Hayes 2004), suggesting that the advantages of\nusing algorithms as sources of identity labels can be challenged\nwhen consumers are reminded of the potential inaccuracy of\nalgorithms.\n\n7.2 | Practical Implications\nThe insights of our research offer valuable guidance for marketers\nto understand consumer behavior in the era of intelligence and\ndigitalization. First, we uncover the source of identity labels as an\neffective way to help companies better leverage the advantages of\nidentity labels in promoting consumers' product preferences.\nWhen consumers are informed that the identity label is generated\nby an algorithm rather than a human, they have higher expected\naccuracy and strength of identification, promoting subsequent\npreference for identity\u2010consistent products. As indicated in\nTable 1, many companies have utilized algorithms to analyze\ninformation and generate identity labels, while only one company\n(i.e., P&G) in the table clearly specifies that the identity labels are\ngenerated by algorithms. Although most companies do not disclose the source of identity labels, our results indicate that companies can benefit from algorithm\u2010generated information by\nrevealing the algorithm as the source of identity labels.\nDespite the ubiquity of identity labels used by companies, most\nstill employ identity labeling as a marketing strategy to attract\nconsumer attention and increase consumers' awareness of\nbrand activities (Gulla 2024). In this research, we examine how\nidentity labeling shapes consumers' preferences for products\nthat align with their identities. We emphasize that when marketers provide an identity label and disclose its algorithmic\nsource, they should also emphasize products that are consistent\nwith that label. These insights also highlight that the benefits of\nalgorithm\u2010generated identity labels can be effectively utilized to\npromote consumers' prosocial or pro\u2010environmental behaviors\n(Liang, Yin, and Xu 2024) in line with the extent of ESG principles (Ferrell and Ferrell 2021).\n10 of 13\n\nIn addition, the boundary condition also highlights the\nreminder that algorithms may be inaccurate can influence\nwhether the advantage of algorithm\u2010generated information is\nfully leveraged. The results indicate that when consumers are\nreminded of the potential inaccuracy of algorithms, the effectiveness of algorithm\u2010generated identity labels in promoting\nconsumers' preference for identity\u2010consistent products will\ndisappear. For companies, especially those aiming to leverage\nthe advantages of algorithms in boosting consumer behavior, it\nis crucial to pay attention to how algorithms are introduced and\napplied. Notably, many companies emphasize the potential\ninaccuracies of algorithms when generating content for consumers. For example, ChatGPT features a sentence below its\ninput box stating, \u201cChatGPT can make mistakes. Check\nimportant info.\u201d It is noteworthy that such disclaimers may\ninfluence consumers' responses to algorithm\u2010generated content,\ninhibiting their preference for identity\u2010consistent products.\n\n7.3 | Limitations and Future Research\nGiven the valuable insights this study provides, there are several\nlimitations that need to be addressed in future research. First,\nwhen designing the three studies in this research, although\nidentity labels were generated for each participant based on\ntheir answers during the consumption tests, the experimental\ndesign limited the identity labels to two categories, with each\nparticipant receiving one of the two labels according to their\nanswers. In marketing scenarios, identity labels are diverse and\ncomplex, often extending beyond merely two categories. Future\nresearch on identity labels could explore and expand the variety\nof identity labels, better personalizing identity labels to align\nwith consumers' unique characteristics.\nIn the current studies, we immediately measured consumers'\nidentity\u2010consistent product preferences after they received an\nidentity label, and the results across studies reveal that\nalgorithm\u2010generated labels are more effective than human\u2010\ngenerated labels in enhancing consumers' product preferences.\nOf note, the impact of the source of identity labels on consumers' subsequent product preference is observed only in the\nshort term. Since consumer identities are relatively fluid,\nwhether the source of identity labels affects consumers' long\u2010\nterm product preferences remains understudied. Hence, future\nresearch could further investigate whether and how the source\nof identity labels can have a profound impact on consumer\nbehavior across various new media platforms (Jia, Liu, and\nLowry 2024; Yin, Jia, and Zheng 2021; Braun et al. 2024).\nNevertheless, aside from consumers' preference for identity\u2010\nconsistent products, the source of identity labels may also have\nother interesting downstream consequences pertaining to consumer responses. For instance, how consumers' implicit attitudes toward companies and brands are influenced after\nreceiving identity labels generated by algorithms, particularly\nwith regard to the companies and brands that recommend\nproducts that are identity\u2010consistent (or inconsistent). This\nspillover preference from product choices to attitudes toward\ncompanies and brands is an interesting question that can be\ninvestigated in the future research.\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22195 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

By emphasizing the impact of source of identity\nlabel on consumers' self\u2010identification and subsequent identity\u2010\nconsistent product preferences through consumers' expected\naccuracy of algorithms, our research advances the understanding of external factors during consumers' identity formation process, highlighting the positive consequences of\nalgorithms as sources of identity labels.\n\n\fThe research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72202066; 72202039; 72432002) and the Shanghai Pujiang\nProgram (22PJC029).\n\nCornelissen, G., S.

For participants labeled as \u201cExpert dieter,\u201d\nchoosing a healthy beverage is viewed as an identity\u2010consistent\nchoice. In contrast, for those labeled as \u201cIntuitive eater,\u201d selecting a\nhealthy beverage is regarded as an identity\u2010inconsistent choice.\nGiven that the slot game is a typical high\u2010risk product (Li and\nYan 2021), for \u201cAdventurous investors,\u201d a higher investment amount\nindicated a greater preference for identity\u2010consistent products. Conversely, for \u201cConservative Investors,\u201d a higher investment amount\nsuggested a stronger preference for identity\u2010inconsistent products\n(therefore, participants who received this identity label would have\ntheir responses reverse\u2010coded to indicate their preference for identity\u2010\nconsistent products).\nSimilar to the coding of participants' choices in Study 1, whether a\nparticipant's choice is identity\u2010consistent (or identity\u2010inconsistent)\ndepends on the identity label they received and the product they\nselected. For participants who received the \u201cInnovators\u201d label,\nchoosing a novel option is considered an identity\u2010consistent choice\nwhereas for those who received the \u201cConservatives\u201d label, selecting a\nnovel option is considered an identity\u2010inconsistent choice.\n\nReferences\nAgogu\u00e9, M., and B.

Bridging signaling theory with the resource\u2010\nbased view, this research reveals that companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion of AI resources can reduce customers\u2019 willingness to engage\nwith AI\u2010based (vs. human\u2010based) services. Four studies, including text mining and experiments, demonstrate that companies\u2019\nself\u2010promotion of AI\u2010based resources has a detrimental effect on willingness to engage, and concurrently perceived as exaggeration. In contrast, companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion about human\u2010related resources yields beneficial outcomes, since such\npromotional signals contribute to the enhancement of human capital. The findings suggest that self\u2010discrepancy and trust are\nthe key underlying factors driving the effects as customers may experience a discrepancy between their expectations of human\u2010\nlike service interactions and actual AI capabilities. Additionally, findings reveal the moderating effect of honest (vs. self\u2010\npromotional) framing on the relationship between service type (AI vs. human) and willingness to engage. Customer perceptions\nof AI appear less influenced by presentation style compared to perceptions of human resources. This research provides valuable\ninsights into how customers respond to companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion of AI resources and emphasizes the need for promotional\nalignment with customers\u2019 expectations about AI.\n\n1 | Introduction\nInvesting in novel technologies based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key for many companies to gain and retain a\ncompetitive advantage. Along with human capital, AI has\nbecome a valuable resource for many leading companies\ncontributing to its superior competitive performance, as posited by resource\u2010based view (RBV) theory (Barney 1991;\nKraaijenbrink, Spender, and Groen 2010). Indeed, companies\nworldwide escalated spending on AI solutions by almost 20%\nin 2022 and are expected to reach $500 bn by 2024 (IDC 2022),\nthus suggesting in some instances a prioritization of investments\n\nin AI technology versus human capital. For instance, Microsoft\nlet go of almost 10,000 employees while contemporaneously reporting a $10bn investment in OpenAI (Marr 2023). These\ndevelopments highlight AI\u2010based technologies\u2019 growing prominence in business, offering companies a potential competitive\nadvantage over those primarily relying on a human workforce.\nAI, defined as \u201cmachines that mimic human intelligence computationally and digitally, designed to emulate (or surpass)\ncapabilities inherent in humans, such as performing mechanical,\nthinking, and feeling tasks\u201d (Huang and Rust 2022, p.210), enables companies to extend beyond human resources in various\nservices tasks.\n\n\u00a9 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025; 34:e22198\nhttps://doi.org/10.1002/mar.22198\n\n1 of 20\n\n\fWhile research has demonstrated that companies\u2019 or people's\nexaggerated self\u2010promotion can backfire (Scopelliti, Loewenstein,\nand Vosgerau 2015; Sezer 2022), the literature does not provide\ndetailed insights about the optimal strategies for companies\u2019\nengagement with the public regarding their novel AI\u2010based services (see Table 1). Tech giants often present their latest AI\u2010based\nresources in a manner that can seem deceptive and exaggerated.\nFor example, Google's launch of Gemini faced criticism for a\n6\u2010min promotional video intended to showcase its advanced AI\ncapabilities, which many perceived as misleading and overly\npromotional (Kovach and Elias 2023).\nHowever, do companies truly face public backlash for promotional activities centered around AI? Evidence suggests they do.\nFor instance, the CEO of Dukaan publicly bragged in X (ex\u2010\nTwitter) about replacing 90% of the company's support staff\nwith an AI chatbot. This led to significant criticism, with many\nexpressing concerns about the ethics of large\u2010scale layoffs and\nthe impact on customer support quality (Royle 2023). Similarly,\nMark Zuckerberg's recent promotion of Meta's AI infrastructure\ninvited scrutiny over privacy and ethics, highlighting how such\nAI boasts can prompt public debate and the actual impact on\nuser experience (Zeff 2024).\nHence, major tech companies, as global trendsetters, heavily\npromote their AI capabilities, setting a precedent for others to\nfollow such as Microsoft's and Google's $7 million Super Bowl\nads in 2024 (Castillo 2024; Vranica 2024). High investments in\nsuch promotional efforts elevate consumer expectations and\ncreate pressure to achieve substantial returns, often diverting\nresources toward AI rather than human capital development.\nAs a result, companies feel compelled to demonstrate the value\nof AI, positioning it as an indispensable solution, which may\nlead them to oversell its capabilities. This raises the questions if\n(a) companies involved in self\u2010promotional activities of their\ncompetitive advantages (human and AI) are impacting customers\u2019 perceptions, and (b) if customer perceptions differ\nwhen comparing human and AI\u2010based self\u2010promotional signals.\n2 of 20\n\nThis paper aims to understand whether companies are actively\ninvolved in the self\u2010promotion of their AI\u2010based (vs. human\u2010\nbased) services. While extensive research has been conducted to\ncompare human with AI in services (McLeay et al. 2021; Mende\net al. 2019; Vorobeva et al. 2022), there remains a knowledge\ngap regarding companies\u2019 self\u2010promotional initiatives based on\ntheir valuable resources: human employees and AI, as well as\nthe resulting customer perceptions.\nOur empirical research aims to make at least three contributions to\nthe literature. First, we bridge signaling (Connelly et al. 2011;\nGriskevicius, Tybur, and Van den Bergh 2010) and RBV\n(Barney 1991; Kraaijenbrink, Spender, and Groen 2010) theories by\nshowing that companies\u2019 valuable resources (skilled employees and\nadvanced technology), depending on how they are signaled and\npromoted to the public, can be a source of competitive advantage\nfor customers. That is, in contrast to previous research that has not\nconsidered the difference between AI versus human companies\u2019\nself\u2010promotion. We provide important theoretical implications to\nRBV (Barney 1991; Kraaijenbrink, Spender, and Groen 2010) by\ndemonstrating that not all companies\u2019 valuable resources (AI vs.\nhuman\u2010based) should be promoted equally to mitigate the\ndecreased willingness to engage and the perception of\nbragging. Second, we clarify this phenomenon by the lenses of self\u2010\ndiscrepancy theory (Higgins 1987; Ukrainets and Homburg 2021)\nand trust. Different perception between customers occurs due to\nincreased self\u2010discrepancy towards AI and sequential lower trust.\nArtificial agents do not grasp promotional signals in the same way\nas humans, causing customers enlarged self\u2010discrepancy and\ndiminished trust. Third, we examine the moderating effect of\nhonest (vs. self\u2010promotional) framing on the relationship between\nservice type (AI vs. human\u2010based) and willingness to engage.\nNotably, there is no significant difference in willingness to engage\nwith AI, regardless of whether it is presented in a promotional or\nhonest manner. This suggests that customer perceptions of AI are\nless sensitive to presentation style than perceptions of human\nresources. Taken together, this research advances understanding of\nservice companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion dilemmas, specifically in contrasting human versus AI services. Marketers can employ these\nfindings for reallocating their promotional investments to reap the\npositive benefits, while reducing the risk to be perceived as\nbraggards.\n\n2 | Literature Review\n2.1 | A Resource\u2010Based View of Companies\u2019 Self\u2010\nPromotion and Bragging\nCompanies engage in self\u2010promotion strategies to gain competitive advantage, highlighting unique resources that differentiate them in the marketplace (Davcik and Sharma 2016).\nSelf\u2010promotion strategies have been discussed across domains\n(Alicke and Sedikides 2009; Gross et al. 2021; Valsesia, Nunes,\nand Ordanini 2021), such that individuals and companies share\nself\u2010enhancing content to positively affect others\u2019 perceptions\n(Scopelliti, Loewenstein, and Vosgerau 2015). Consequently,\ncompanies expect that customers and stakeholders may perceive their products and services more positively, leading to\nincreased sales, higher funding, and positive stakeholder evaluations (Alicke and Sedikides 2009; Bass et al. 2023; Purnell\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

It\nis noteworthy that active promotion of valuable human assets or\nthe companies\u2019 technological advances can have an unexpected\nnegative effect. Specifically, what is considered as a promotion by a\ncompany, can be perceived as bragging and exaggeration by customers (Scopelliti, Loewenstein, and Vosgerau 2015). Bragging (or\nexaggeration) is a self\u2010presentation tactic (self\u2010promotional signals)\nor a tendency to embellish one's merits and lessen their shortcomings (Alicke and Sedikides 2009). Research on self\u2010promotion\nhas primarily concentrated on an individual's perspective (Den\nHartog, De Hoogh, and Belschak 2020; Gross et al. 2021) or companies\u2019 impression management (Bass et al. 2023; Jin, Li, and\nHoskisson 2022), overlooking conceivable differences in self\u2010\npromotion of companies\u2019 valuable assets in the smart services\ncontext: human employees and artificial entities. In this research,\nwe adopt companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion as a means for companies to\nsignal their capabilities by presenting their new AI\u2010based (vs.\nhuman\u2010based) smart services to the public.\n\n\fExplores how overconfidence serves\nas a mechanism for individuals to\nattain higher social status.

In the context of AI, however, it\nis unclear if similar perceptions arise. This aligns with signaling\ntheory (Connelly et al. 2011; Griskevicius, Tybur, and Van den\nBergh 2010) as it entails how companies signal their AI\u2010related or\nemployee\u2010related capabilities to customers. Signaling theory suggests that signals convey key information, and our study examines\ntheir effectiveness, especially considering they may be viewed as\ncostly signals (Griskevicius, Tybur, and Van den Bergh 2010) given\ncompanies\u2019 substantial investment in AI development, implementation, and promotion (Miller, Davenport, and Bhattacharya 2023).\nAI is a contemporary competitive advantage of service companies\nwhich can be better understood through the lens of Resource\u2010\nBased View (RBV). The RBV posits that a firm's resources, when\nvaluable, rare, inimitable, and non\u2010substitutable, contribute to its\nuniqueness and long\u2010term success. By promoting companies\u2019 unique assets, including technological resources, they can differentiate themselves from competitors and establish a sustainable\ncompetitive advantage (Barney 1991; Kraaijenbrink, Spender, and\nGroen 2010). Thus, the investment in self\u2010promotion of companies\u2019\nAI capabilities seems to be an effective way to signal the firm's\nstrengths, ultimately leading to a competitive edge in the market.\nIn the context of human\u2010based resources, self\u2010promotional signals do not always lead to the desired positive outcome. The\nliterature suggests that these activities can often be perceived\nnegatively, in particular, as bragging. For instance, Scopelliti,\nLoewenstein, and Vosgerau (2015) discovered that recipients\ntend to react less favorably to self\u2010promotion than self\u2010\npromoters anticipate, \u201cand that the decision to brag may often\nbe made without an accurate consideration of recipients\u2019\nreactions\u201d (p. 10). Indeed, self\u2010promotion can be associated with\na selfish motivation (Berman et al. 2015) and actively sharing\nself\u2010enhancing content can reduce the likability of both individuals and companies (Valsesia, Nunes, and Ordanini 2021).\nEmpirical evidence on customer perceptions of AI versus\nhuman\u2010centered self\u2010promotional efforts remains limited. We\npropose that companies, in their self\u2010promotional activities,\n\nmay potentially unintentionally foster perceptions of bragging.\nBig tech firms, for instance, invest heavily in AI\u2010based service\npromotion (Castillo 2024), aiming to increase customer acceptance. Notably, scholars have pointed out the importance of\nexploring how AI agents, like human capabilities, can be leveraged in promotional strategies (Krakowski, Luger, and\nRaisch 2023).\nFrom an academic standpoint, promotional signals are subject to interpretation (Connelly et al. 2011), and when firms\nemphasize their AI capabilities, consumers may perceive the\nmessage as overly self\u2010serving. Given that customers probably have doubts and anxiety towards AI technology (Raisch\nand Krakowski 2021; West, Whittaker, and Crawford 2019),\nself\u2010promotional claims about AI\u2010based services may be\nespecially prone to be interpreted as bragging. This perception could be amplified by consumers\u2019 limited trust in AI,\nespecially given the \u201cblack box\u201d nature of algorithms, which\nconceals how decisions are made (Dietvorst, Simmons, and\nMassey 2015). Indeed, human\u2010machine interactions often\nevoke uncertainty and necessitate new trust\u2010building strategies (Kim, Giroux, and Lee 2021; Seegebarth, Backhaus, and\nWoisetschl\u00e4ger 2019).\nFurther, possible negative sentiment toward AI may be\nheightened by the perception that AI lacks contextual awareness compared to humans (Balasubramanian, Ye, and Xu 2022)\nand that competitors may offer similar AI\u2010based services\n(Kemp 2024), potentially leading to a less distinct service experience, since consumers may experience uncertainty, limited\ntrust and uniqueness of the AI\u2010based offering. Thus, we compare AI (vs. human\u2010oriented) self\u2010promotion to explore whether\nsignaling AI's unique capabilities may be perceived as less likable and as bragging as contrasted with humans.\nNext, to investigate how customers respond to self\u2010promotional\nsignals emphasizing human versus AI\u2010oriented achievements,\nwe consider how expectations and trust levels differ across these\ncontexts. Scopelliti, Loewenstein, and Vosgerau (2015) argue\nthat self\u2010promotion perception may adjust according to the interacting parties, the relationship between these parties, and the\ncurrent situation. Although AI has become integral to many\ncompanies, customers often hold higher expectations for AI,\nexpecting zero mistakes and consistently flawless performance\n(Gray 2017). Customers have lower trust in AI (Davenport\net al. 2020; Kim, Giroux, and Lee 2021), which leads them to set\nhigher expectations for it, because AI is perceived as lacking the\ncapacity to feel and to be vulnerable (Gray 2017) depending on a\ntask it performs (Huang and Rust 2022).\nThis dynamic can lead to a less favorable response toward AI\u2010\nbased self\u2010promotion, as the relationship between customers\nand AI differs significantly from human relationships (Huang\nand Rust 2021a). Overall, self\u2010promotion highlighting human\nachievements tends to resonate more positively, enhancing the\ntrust and relatability inherent in human interactions (Granulo,\nFuchs, and Puntoni 2019; Vorobeva et al. 2024). Arguably,\ncustomers tend to resonate more with narratives involving\nhuman experiences and expertise, making them more receptive\nto company's human's self\u2010promotion. In contrast, self\u2010\npromotion of AI capabilities may reduce customer willingness\n7 of 20\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nand Olson 2019). Diverse marketing resources, such as technologies and service employees, can both shape a companies\u2019\ncompetitive advantage and performance (Davcik and\nSharma 2016). Yet, various studies suggest that self\u2010promotion\nentails the risk of appearing as arrogant and overtly bragging,\nwhich can hurt the overall image of a person or a company\n(Berman et al. 2015; Valsesia, Nunes, and Ordanini 2021).\nIndeed, Scopelliti, Loewenstein and Vosgerau (2015) suggest\nthat people overestimate the potential positive effect that self\u2010\npromotion will have on observers. Rather than feeling the same\nlevel of happiness and pride as a self\u2010promoter, observers (e.g.,\ncustomers) feel annoyed by the self\u2010promotion effort. Consequently, self\u2010promoters are seen as less likeable and as braggarts, leading to what we term as the \u201cself\u2010promotion dilemma\u201d\nfor companies.\n\n\fH1 Companies\u2019 self\u2010promotional signals about AI (vs. human)\nbased services have detrimental effects on customers\u2019 willingness\nto engage with such services.\n\n2.3 | AI Self\u2010Promotion: The Underlying Process\nof Self\u2010Discrepancy and Trust\nTech companies often exaggerate AI capabilities to capture\ncustomers and stakeholders\u2019 attention (Purnell and Olson 2019;\nBridle 2023), sometimes leading to perceptions of embellished\nself\u2010promotion (Kovach and Elias 2023). Having established\nthat both human and AI\u2010based self\u2010promotion can influence\ncustomers\u2019 willingness to engage with the company, it is of\ninterest to further explore the underlying mechanisms.\nWe propose that self\u2010discrepancy, and consequently reduced\ntrust, may be determinant in driving this effect. Self\u2010discrepancy\ntheory (Higgins 1987; Ukrainets and Homburg 2021) suggests\nthat a person's self has multiple representations, and that discrepancy arises when there is a mismatch among these different\ndimensions, especially in advertising (Consiglio and van\nOsselaer 2022; Moldes and Ku 2020). In fact, as humans are\nreceptive to social interactions, perceptions of others can also\ninfluence their sense of self and subsequently induce a sense of\nself\u2010discrepancy (Aw and Chuah 2021).\nCustomer's lay beliefs about AI, particularly their perception\nthat AI is incapable of accurately embodying human characteristics (Lu, Zhang, and Zhang 2021; S\u00f6derlund and\nOikarinen 2021), play a significant role in shaping their\nresponses to AI\u2010related self\u2010promotion: customers not readily\nidentifying with AI. When individuals attribute minds capabilities, a trait that is perceived to be uniquely human, to a\nnonhuman agent, it significantly influences their perception of\nthe agent's competence and may activate a feeling of fear to\nhuman identity (Uysal, Alavi, and Bezen\u00e7on 2022; Vorobeva\net al. 2022). People often recognize AI as one\u2010sided \u2013 impressive\nthinking abilities \u2013 but lack any capacity for experiencing\nemotions (Gray 2017), thus increasing the level of discrepancy\nbetween humans and AI. In some cases, self\u2010discrepancies can\neven lead to negative outcomes such as unpleasant emotions or\nbehaviors (Shehzala et al. 2024).\nFurthermore, recent research shows that during consumption\nexperiences, consumers may feel that the usage of an AI may\nnot align with their self\u2010identity, and this can create negative\nfeelings such as regret of interacting with an AI (Rita Gon\u00e7alves\net al. 2025). Beyond virtual AI agents, even during interactions\nwith physical technological agents such as robots, human\u2010robot\nincongruity reduces perceived comfort in the service (Pitardi\nand Marriott 2021). This is akin to self\u2010discrepancy because\nincongruity is described as an inconsistency among a person's\nbelief (Higgins 1987; Mende et al. 2019). Consequently, given\nthe discussed insights on AI versus human in services, self\u2010\ndiscrepancy might act as a crucial mediator in the relationship\nbetween companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion of valuable resources and\ncustomer perceptions. In the case of companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion\n8 of 20\n\nof AI\u2010based resources, customers may experience a discrepancy\nbetween their expectations of human\u2010like service interactions\nand the reality of AI capabilities (Vorobeva et al. 2024).\nSelf\u2010discrepancy may also play a crucial role in shaping customers\u2019 trust perceptions. In human\u2010technology interactions,\ntrust reflects a customer's confident expectation that a company\nusing advanced technologies can fulfill promises made to customers, act consistently, and prioritize consumers interest\n(Oliveira et al. 2017). In other words, trust in AI hinges on the\nsystem's ability to meet customer expectations accurately and\nreliably (e.g., Kim, Giroux, and Lee 2021; Pitardi and\nMarriott 2021). Arguably, when customers experience low self\u2010\ndiscrepancy (when AI aligns well with their expectations) trust\nin AI tends to be enhanced (Alabed, Javornik, and Gregory\u2010\nSmith 2022). Conversely, a larger self\u2010discrepancy should negatively affect their trust toward the AI.\nThe connection between self\u2010discrepancy and trust is particularly significant since trust in both human and AI agents is a\nkey driver of positive customer perceptions (e.g., Chi et al. 2021;\nNoble and Mende 2023). Indeed, the absence of relational\nhuman\u2010like characteristics and uniqueness may have adverse\nresults on customer perceptions of trust during service encounters (Grewal et al. 2021; Robinson et al. 2020). Moreover,\nthere is also a negative association between bragging and trust\nperceptions (Chan, Reese, and Ybarra 2021), since negative\ntrust cues can signal self\u2010interest and impede persuasion\n(Packard 2015). As such, both self\u2010discrepancy and trust likely\nshape customers\u2019 behavioral responses, influencing their willingness to engage with AI\u2010promoted services and perceptions of\nexaggeration. Therefore, we propose:\n\nH2\n\nSelf\u2010discrepancy and trust serially mediate the effect of a\ncompanies\u2019 self\u2010promotion of AI (vs. human) based services on\ncustomers\u2019 willingness to engage and perceived exaggeration.\n\n2.4 | The Moderating Effect of Honest (vs. Self\u2010\nPromotional) Framing\nIn this research, our key proposition is that customers display a\nlower willingness to engage if a company applies self\u2010\npromotional signals of an AI\u2010empowered service compared to a\nhuman service. However, we acknowledge that not all communication strategies will be equally effective. Therefore, we\npropose that the impact of AI versus human\u2010based self\u2010\npromotion depends on whether the company emphasizes only\nthe resource's strengths (i.e., self\u2010promotion framing) or adopts\na more transparent approach that acknowledges potential limitations (i.e., honest framing).\nThe self\u2010promotion dilemma highlights the delicate balance\ncompanies should seek when promoting their resources or\nservices. Companies as well as individuals are motivated to\nshare self\u2010enhancing content to highlight their accomplishments and capabilities to be perceived as competent by\nobservers (Bolino and Turnley 1999). However, this act can also\nbe perceived as bragging, which is not always looked upon\nfavorably (Valsesia, Nunes, and Ordanini 2021). Consequently,\ncompanies may choose a more honest approach to self\u2010\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nto engage, as it often lacks this relational foundation and may\nevoke skepticism. More formally\n\n\fStudies indicate that self\u2010promotion emphasizing honesty and\nhumility, with an accurate portrayal of limitations, positively\ninfluences consumer perceptions (O'Mara et al. 2019) and\npotentially leads to higher profit margins (Kopalle and\nLehmann 2015). VanEpps, Hart and Schweitzer (2023) suggest\nthat promoting both one's achievements and others can lead to\nmore positive overall impressions.\nMeanwhile, despite the fact that self\u2010enhancing self\u2010promotion\nmay not always lead to a positive result, some forms of self\u2010\naggrandizement may be acceptable among consumers (O'Mara\net al. 2019; Pai, Chou, and Halevy 2023). In particular, while\nboth honest and self\u2010enhancing self\u2010promotion can work,\narguably, the latter may still be perceived more positively when\npromoting the capabilities of human resources. Studies suggest\nthat people who engage in self\u2010enhancing behavior project\nconfidence, thus being perceived as more competent (Anderson\net al. 2012). Further research in social psychology suggests that\npeople exposed to self\u2010enhancing behaviors, such as self\u2010\npromotion, tend to attribute success to personal ability (Alicke\nand Sedikides 2009). Instead, while modesty and humility may\nbe valued, in competitive settings like the marketplace, such\nbehaviors can lead also to defensive behaviors (Bharanitharan\net al. 2019) and impressions of reduced competence (Gaucher\net al. 2012). Hence, although people generally value honesty, it\ncan sometimes be fruitful to be somewhat dishonest (Cooper\net al. 2023).\nSimilarly, an AI\u2010based service can also be promoted in a more\nself\u2010enhancing or honest manner. However, it is noteworthy\nthat customers' relationship with AI differs from human relationships (Huang and Rust 2021b). Due to the relatability that\nhuman interactions entail (Vorobeva et al. 2024), customers\ntend to be more receptive toward interactions between humans\ninstead of human\u2010AI interactions. Furthermore, ample research\nsuggests a general trend of AI aversion, as customers find it\ndifficult to perceive these interactions as satisfactory and living\nup to their expectations (e.g., Castelo, Bos, and Lehmann 2019;\nGranulo, Fuchs, and Puntoni 2019). Although interactions and\nexperiences with AI can evoke some positive emotions, they can\nalso sometimes lead to confusion and disappointment (Shank\net al. 2019). This is often due to the fact that they do not meet\nexpectations (Cukier 2021), which can be detrimental to the\ntrust put in products or messages obtained about AI. As such,\nthe reduced level of connection that customers may feel toward\nAI, compared to other humans, can lead to a certain degree of\nindifference when interacting with these technological agents.\nThis notion is supported by findings showing that people tend\nto attribute less blame or success to actions and recommendations of AI, suggesting that customers may be decentered (e.g.,\nGarvey, Kim, and Duhachek 2023; Passlack et al. 2023; Zhang\net al. 2025). In other words, customers may be less sensitive\ntoward AI capabilities compared to humans.\nThus, in the context of AI\u2010based service promotion that is self\u2010\nenhancing or honest, indifference and lack of relational connection with the AI may lead customers to perceive associated\ncommunications in a similar manner. This stands in contrast to\n\nhuman\u2010based service promotions, where customers relate and\ncare more about the actor associated with the message\n(Granulo, Fuchs, and Puntoni 2019). More formally this leads to\nthe following hypothesis:\n\nH3\n\nFor human\u2010based services, presentation type (promotional\nvs. honest) positively moderates the effect on their willingness to\nengage with the service. In contrast, for AI\u2010based services,\npresentation type (promotional vs honest) does not influence\ntheir willingness to engage with the service.\n\n3 | Overview of Studies\nTo test our assumption and hypotheses, we conducted a preliminary study (sentiment analysis of public tweets) to verify\nwhether companies are involved in AI\u2010related self\u2010promotional\nsignaling. Online impression management is a crucial research\navenue (Scott and Fullwood 2020) making investigation of\nsocial media posts relevant and important. X (formerly Twitter)\nis an excellent platform for self\u2010promotional and branding\nactivities (Olausson 2018). After having established that companies frequently engage in AI\u2010related self\u2010promotion with\nhighly positive sentiment, we divide the data set into two parts\nto create additional metrics: a bragging score and an honesty\nscore. We then analyze the correlation between these scores and\ncustomer engagement (measured by likes) to determine\nwhether high sentiment reflects bragging and whether customers responded differently to tweets perceived as bragging\nversus honest. Furthermore, Study 1 and 2 explore companies\u2019\nself\u2010promotional effect on customers\u2019 willingness to engage in a\nmore controlled environment of experimental design. In particular, Study 1 analyzes whether companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion of\nAI versus human\u2010based service influence willingness to engage\nwith any of them. Study 2 further tests the effects of AI versus\nhuman service on customers\u2019 willingness to engage, underlying\nmechanisms of self\u2010discrepancy and trust, and whether the self\u2010\npromotion of AI versus human service is perceived as bragging.\nLastly, Study 3 further explores how AI versus human service\nimpacts customers\u2019 willingness to engage, analyzing the moderating role of presentation type (promotional vs. honest) and\nreinforcing self\u2010discrepancy and trust mediation effect.\n\n3.1 | Preliminary Study\n3.1.1 | Design and Procedures\nThis preliminary X (ex\u2010Twitter) study aims to explore the sentiment of the broad public towards AI promotion to set the\nfoundation for later studies about AI\u2010oriented self\u2010promotional\nphenomenon.\nTweets were collected via Twitter API, and the sentiment\nanalysis was performed using Python. We extracted AI\u2010related\ntweets from known technology\u2010oriented companies: Amazon,\nGoogle, and Apple. We selected tweets from large tech companies due to their significant social media presence and the\nhigher level of user engagement typically associated with their\nproducts (Zhang, Gosselt, and de Jong 2020). We collected\ntweets from January 2010 till the end of November 2022,\n9 of 20\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

The repetitive tweets (retweets)\nwere eliminated, and the final data set contained 1,406 unique\ntweets. Sentiment analysis was conducted using the VADER\nsentiment analyses package that has proved good accuracy for\ntweet classification (Elbagir and Yang 2019). The following compound was used: most extreme negative (\u22121), most extreme positive (1). The threshold values used to transform the quantitative\nvalue to a qualitative were the following: positive tweets \u2013 compound score greater than or equal 0.05, neutral tweets \u2013 compound score between \u22120.05 and 0.05, and negative tweets \u2013\ncompound score less than or equal \u20100.05 (Hutto and Gilbert 2014).\n\n3.1.2 | Sentiment Analysis Results\nThe overall sentiment analysis revealed that only 4.34% (N = 61)\nof tweets had negative connotations. The majority were positive\n(76.32%, N = 1,073), and 19.35% (N = 272) of the tweets were\nneutral. The compound score was 0.29. These initial results\nindicate that the sentiment towards AI\u2010empowered technologies\nposted by tech companies has a strong tendency for a positive\nconnotation, and companies are proudly presenting to the public\nits technological innovations and achievements. Consequently,\nwe conclude that companies are actively involved in self\u2010\npromotional activities towards AI\u2010based technologies. As a result,\nit reflects company\u2010driven marketing rather than providing an\naccurate picture of public opinion on AI, which may bias the\nresults towards a positive view of AI. However, the question\nwhether these self\u2010promotional materials are perceived as bragging remains uncertain. Thus, after having confirmed that\ncompanies actively participate in AI\u2010related self\u2010promotion in\nsocial media, we ran additional tests to establish whether the\nstatements about AI are perceived as bragging and exaggeration.\nTo do so, we analyzed the linguistic features of the tweets, creating key metrics: bragging score and honesty score. The bragging score quantifies the extent of self\u2010promotion in a tweet.\nConversely, the honesty score reflects the degree of transparency\nand sincerity in the language used (see Appendix A).\n\n3.1.3 | Bragging versus Honesty Scores Results\nTo calculate the bragging and honesty scores, we employed\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), which have proven itself as\nhighly reliable and versatile tools for text mining (Wan\net al. 2024). The data set with the previously analyzed tweets\nand sentiment score was uploaded to Azure AI Studio. The\nAzure AI model (powered by ChatGPT 4 version) was provided\ninstructions and context (\u201cact as a data analyst to investigate\ncorporate tweets\u201d). Detailed prompts are presented in Appendix\nA. In Azure AI platform, we set the temperature at \u201c0\u201d to\n10 of 20\n\nminimize the model's AI hallucinations and to eliminate\npotential nonsensical or inaccurate outputs. The AI model established a list of keywords associated with self\u2010promotion,\nincluding terms such as \u201cbest,\u201d \u201ctop,\u201d \u201cleading,\u201d and \u201cproud.\u201d\nA similar procedure was adopted for the calculation of an\nhonesty score. Then, the bragging score and honesty score\ncolumns were created in the existing excel file. The keywords\nfor bragging and honesty were chosen based on their relevance\nto the concepts of self\u2010promotion and transparency in corporate\ntweets (see Appendix A for details).\nPython was used to conduct the statistical analyses. First, the\npresence of bragging or honesty\u2010related keywords for each\ntweet was identified, and a bragging and honesty score ranging\nfrom 0 to 1 was calculated based on the ratio of bragging or\nhonesty keywords present relative to the total number of keywords in the tweet.\nThen, we analyzed the calculated sentiment score and users\u2019\nnumber of likes extracted via Twitter API, adding the bragging\nscore and honesty score. First, the data skewness was checked.\nThe skewness of sentiment score was found to be \u20100.59\n(moderately skewed), while the skewness of users\u2019 likes, bragging score, and honesty score was 22.77, 3.59, and 6.97 respectively, indicating highly positively skewed data. Consequently,\nwe used non\u2010parametric correlation measures, like Spearman's\nrank correlation, which can better handle non\u2010normal and\nskewed data (Cain, Zhang, and Yuan 2017).\nSpearman's rank correlation was used to assess the relationship\nbetween bragging score, honesty score, users\u2019 likes, and sentiment\nscore. Spearman's test demonstrated a statistically significant\ncorrelation between the bragging score and the sentiment score\n(rs = 0.143, p < 0.001, N = 1406) but not between bragging score\nand users\u2019 likes (rs = \u20100.006, p = 0.82). In addition, as expected,\nthe relationship between the honesty score and the sentiment score\nwas not statistically significant (rs = 0.033, p = 0.22) as well as\nbetween honesty score and users\u2019 likes (rs = \u20100.000, p = 0.99).\nTo verify the robustness of the statistically significant difference\nbetween the bragging score and the sentiment score, we run\nMann\u2010Whitney U test, which is a non\u2010parametric test and does\nnot assume normality and is more suitable for skewed data\n(Cain, Zhang, and Yuan 2017). The bragging score was recoded\ninto a binary variable: group 0 (the tweets that received a\nbragging score of 0, indicating no self\u2010promotional language)\nand group 1 (tweets that received a bragging score greater than\n0, indicating any level of self\u2010promotional language). The\ndependent variable was the sentiment score. Group 0 had a\nmean sentiment score of M = 0.41 (SD = 0.35). In contrast,\nGroup 1 exhibited a higher mean sentiment score of M = 0.58\n(SD = 0.30). The results of the test indicated a statistically significant difference between the groups (U = 57,574.5, p < 0.05).\n\n3.1.4 | Discussion\nOur initial exploration, using sentiment analysis and advanced\nlanguage models, supports our main prediction that AI\u2010focused\nself\u2010promotion often takes the form of market bragging, which is\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

Tweets were\nretrieved using the query: (\u201cartificial intelligence\u201d OR AI OR\nrobot OR automation OR technology OR \u201cintelligent machine\u201d\nOR machine OR \u201cvirtual assistant\u201d OR \u201cvoice assistant\u201d OR\n\u201cvirtual reality\u201d OR \u201cvirtual assistant\u201d OR \u201cchatbot\u201d OR Alexa/\nGoogle Assistant/Siri). It is worth noting that AI\u2010related tweets\npublished by the three chosen companies started appearing\nonly in 2017.\n\n\fWhile this exploratory analysis of public sentiment provides\nvaluable insights into the overall trends of these relationships, it\nhas limitations in terms of statistical inference. Additionally,\ncustomer engagement with tweets (measured by likes) showed\nno correlation with either bragging or honesty scores, indicating\nno perceptible difference in user reactions to these posts. This\nmay be related to the type of service provider (AI vs. human) and\nwarrants further investigation. Consequently, we conducted\nadditional studies (Studies 2a, 2b, and 3) in more controlled\nenvironments, allowing for a deeper examination of companies\u2019\nAI\u2010related self\u2010promotion and customer willingness to engage.\n\n3.2 | Study 1\n3.2.1 | Participants and Design\nStudy 1 determines the relationship between service (AI vs.\nhuman\u2010based) and customers\u2019 perception of companies\u2019 self\u2010\npromotion (willingness to engage). 180 participants from the\nUK (49.4% women; Mage = 37.13, SD = 12.89) were recruited on\nProlific as exchange of a fee to take part in the study.\n\n3.2.2 | Procedure and Stimuli\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of the two scenarios:\ncompanies\u2019 promotion of novel AI\u2010empowered service, JD, or\nabout a new service manager, JD, and his outstanding accomplishments. An AI definition was added to the AI\u2010related condition: \u201cAI (Artificial intelligence) is the capability of a computer\nprogram to perform tasks or reasoning processes that we usually\nassociate with intelligence in a human being\u201d (see Appendix B).\n\nengage (Welch t(156.157) = \u20106.633, p < 0.01; Levene's test p < 0.05,\nequal variances not assumed). The average willingness to engage (AI\u2010based) (M = 5.58, SD = 2.02) was significantly lower\nthan willingness to engage (human\u2010based service) (M = 7.32,\nSD = 1.43).\n\n3.2.5 | Discussion\nWe conclude that customers display lower willingness to engage\nif a company applies self\u2010promotional signals towards AI\u2010\nempowered service (vs. human) supporting H1. On the other\nhand, self\u2010promotional signals about human employee's abilities increases the willingness to engage with the service provided by this employee. Thereafter, in the next study, we aim to\nreproduce the results of study 1, while examining whereas self\u2010\npromotional signals are perceived by customers as bragging and\nanalyzing a possible underlying mechanism of self\u2010discrepancy.\n\n3.3 | Study 2\n3.3.1 | Participants and Design\n181 participants from the US (49.2% women; Mage = 46.3,\nSD = 11.22) were recruited on Mturk, with only Master Workers\nincluded to ensure higher data quality. Study 2 examined the\neffect of type of service provider on willingness to engage on\nperceived bragging (aka exaggeration), and the mediation effect\nof self\u2010discrepancy. The study used a between\u2010subjects experimental design, with two types of service: AI versus human\u2010\nbased.\n\n3.3.2 | Procedure and Stimuli\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. They were introduced to companies\u2019 promoting \u201cJD, the\nnew manager with outstanding skills\u201d, or \u201cJD, the new AI\u2010\nbased service with unique features\u201d. Detailed scenarios can be\nfound in Appendix C.\n\n3.2.3 | Measures\nRespondents were asked to answer a set of questions measuring\nwillingness to engage with a service provided by JD\n(measurement is in Appendix B). A 9\u2010point Likert scale was used\nwhere 1 \u2010 strongly disagree and 9 \u2010 strongly agree. As a manipulation check, participants were asked to indicate if 1 \u2013 JD was a\nhuman manager or 9 \u2013 JD was an AI\u2010empowered technology\n(Welch t(153.816) = 11.653, p < 0.01; Levene's test p < 0.05, equal\nvariances not assumed). The manipulation check was assessed by\na single\u2010item in a nine\u2010point scale. We also included participants\nAI knowledge (Huisman et al. 2021) as a control variable.\n\n3.2.4 | Results\nT\u2010test showed a significant difference in the mean between self\u2010\npromotion of service (AI vs. human\u2010based) in willingness to\n\n3.3.3 | Measures\nRespondents were asked to answer a set of questions measuring\nwillingness to engage, the same as in study 1, and additional\nexaggeration and self\u2010discrepancy variables (measures can be\nfound in Appendix B). Exaggeration is the respondents\u2019 perception whether the achievements and skills of JD were embellished (adopted from Levashina and Campion 2007) where a\nhigher score represents a higher customers\u2019 perception of\nbragging and exaggeration. We coded the data as follows:\nAI = 1, Human = 2. As a manipulation check, participants were\nasked to indicate if, as in the study 1, 1 \u2013 JD was a human\nmanager or 9 \u2013 JD was an AI\u2010empowered service (Welch\nt(153.561) = 19.055, p < 0.01; Levene's test p < 0.05, equal variances not assumed). It was assessed by a single\u2010item in a nine\u2010\npoint scale. As in the previous study, we also measured\n11 of 20\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

We observed a significant correlation between high sentiment scores and bragging\nscores, with no link between sentiment scores and honesty\nscores, underlining the bragging\u2010like nature of positively received\nAI\u2010related tweets. This suggests that self\u2010promotional efforts\naround AI\u2010based services frequently resemble forms of bragging.\n\n\f3.3.4 | Results\nT\u2010test revealed a significant difference in the mean between\npromotional presentation about AI and human\u2010based service in\nwillingness to engage (Welch t(150.183) = \u20105.417, p < 0.01,\nLevene's test p < 0.05, equal variances not assumed), and exaggeration (t179 = 2.532, p < 0.01, where is homogeneity of variances between groups, as assessed by the Levene's test for\nequality of variances (p >. 05)). The average willingness to\nengage with AI\u2010based service (M = 6.50, SD = 2.04) was significantly lower than willingness to engage with human\u2010based\nservice (M = 7.92, SD = 1.42). Furthermore, the average perception of exaggeration of service provided by AI was significantly higher (M = 4.69, SD = 2.37) than exaggeration of the\nhuman service provider's skills (M = 3.81, SD = 2.32).\n\nSE = 0.26; p < 0.01). Second, self\u2010discrepancy influenced trust\n(b = \u2010.74, SE = 0.05; p < 0.01) whereas trust had a positive effect\non willingness to engage with the service (b = 0.66, SE = 0.06;\np < 0.01). The total effect was also significant (b = 1.43, SE =\n0.26; p < 0.01; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.94) (see Figure 1a).\nNext, we tested the same serial mediation with exaggeration as\na dependent variable. Again, the results proved that service (AI\nvs. human\u2010based) significantly affected self\u2010discrepancy\n(b = \u2010.83, SE = 0.26; p < 0.05). Second, self\u2010discrepancy influenced trust (b = \u2010.74, SE = 0.05; p < 0.01) whereas trust had a\nnegative effect on perceived exaggeration (b = \u20100.26, SE = 0.12;\np < 0.05). The total effect was also significant (b = \u22120.88,\nSE = 0.35; p < 0.05; 95% CI: \u22121.57 to \u22120.20) (see Figure 1b).\nHence, study 2 results suggest that we reached a serial mediation of self\u2010discrepancy and trust for willingness to engage and\nexaggeration (see Figure 1a,b).\n\n3.3.6 | Discussion\nTo further detail the analysis on willingness to engage and\nperception of exaggeration, we conducted ANCOVAs showing\nthat type of service provider continued to significantly affect\ndependent variables, even when controlling for AI knowledge\n(F(1, 178) = 30.28; p < 0.01) on willingness to engage and AI\nknowledge (F(1, 178) = 6.36; p < 0.05) on exaggeration.\n\n3.3.5 | Mediation Analysis\nAdditionally, we analyzed the mediation process through self\u2010\ndiscrepancy and trust (Model 6; Hayes 2013). The bootstrap\nanalysis confirms a significant serial mediation effect of self\u2010\ndiscrepancy (mediator 1) and trust (mediator 2) between service\n(AI vs. human\u2010based) and customers\u2019 willingness to engage and\nexaggeration. First, the results demonstrate that service (AI vs.\nhuman\u2010based) significantly affected self\u2010discrepancy (b = \u2010.83,\n\nFIGURE 1\n\n12 of 20\n\nStudy 2 reinforces the results we obtained in study 1 \u2010 customers\nhave a lower willingness to engage when company presents\ninnovative AI\u2010based service (vs. human) (supported H1), and\nthis phenomenon is mediated by self\u2010discrepancy and trust\n(supported H2). Additionally, this study revealed that companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion of AI service (vs. human) is perceived as\nexaggerated (supported our initial assumption), and that this\nprocess is also mediated by self\u2010discrepancy (supported H2). In\nthis study, the underlying mechanism is self\u2010discrepancy and\ntrust, which fluctuates between promoting AI\u2010based service and\nhuman counterpart. Therefore, the results of study 2 supported\nH1 and H2 identifying that companies\u2019 self\u2010promotional efforts\nabout their artificial entity increases customers\u2019 self\u2010\ndiscrepancy, diminishes trust, and as a result decreases willingness to engage or reinforces the perception that this is not\njust a self\u2010promotion, but exaggeration and bragging.

Based on\nthe results of studies 1 and 2a, it could be argued that the\nfindings we identified are not unique to the AI\u2010related context,\nbut rather relevant to the skillset of a service provider\n(Vorobeva et al. 2022, 2024). In line with the Feeling Economy\n(Huang, Rust, and Maksimovic 2019; Rust and Huang 2021), we\nsuggest that highlighting AI\u2010related thinking skills (i.e., analytical and computational) in the companies\u2019 promotional\nactivities can positively shape customer perceptions. Conversely, companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion of AI\u2010related feelings tasks\n(i.e., negotiations and communication) might have an adverse\nimpact on customers\u2019 perceptions coming across as exaggerated.\nThe results demonstrate that the service provider's skillset\n(thinking vs. feeling) does not influence the strength and the\nnature of the indirect relationship between the self\u2010promotion\nof the service provider (AI vs. human\u2010based) (independent\nvariable) and willingness to engage with the service/perception\nof exaggeration (dependent variables) through self\u2010discrepancy\n(mediator) or through trust (another mediator). The detailed\nresults of the robustness study can be found in Appendix D.\n\nhuman\u2010based) x two (type of presentation: promotional vs.\nhonest) between\u2010subjects experimental design.\n\n3.4.2 | Procedure and Stimuli\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. They were introduced to JD, the new service manager, or\nJD, the new AI\u2010based service. In the promotional scenarios, JD\nwas presented as an extraordinary employee/technology (as in\nthe previous studies 2a and 2b), while in the honest one, it was\nadmitted that JD has certain flaws that have to be tolerated for\nthe time being. In the scenario about AI\u2010based service, a definition of AI was added at the end as in the previous studies.\nDetailed scenarios can be found in Appendix E.\n\n3.4.3 | Measures\nRespondents were asked to answer a set of questions measuring\nwillingness to engage and self\u2010discrepancy the same as in studies\n2a and 2b. We coded data as following: AI = 1, Human = 2;\nPromotional = \u20101, Honest = 1. As a manipulation check for the\ntype of service provider, participants were asked to indicate if, as\nin previous studies, 1 \u2013 JD was a human manager or 9 \u2013 JD was\nan AI\u2010empowered technology (Welch t(286.571) = 26.154, p < 0.01;\nLevene's test p < 0.05, equal variances not assumed). Next,\nrespondents answered the question if JD's presentation was more\n1 \u2010 honest or 9 \u2013 bragging presentation (Welch t(327.008) = 7.386,\np < 0.01; Levene's test p < 0.05, equal variances not assumed).\nBoth manipulation checks were assessed by a single\u2010item in a\nnine\u2010point scale. As before, we measured participants AI\nknowledge (Huisman et al. 2021) as a control variable.\n\n3.4 | Study 3\nAs established in previous studies, companies often face the\ntemptation to boost or exaggerate their capabilities (technology\nand employees) to gain a competitive edge. However, there is a\nsignificant difference between such practices and an honest\npresentation of a company's minor flaws. Some studies suggest\nthat being open about a company's limitations, when done\nstrategically and in a transparent manner, can foster positive\nconsumer perceptions (Ein\u2010Gar, Shiv, and Tormala 2012). Previous research demonstrated that AI\u2010related failures are generalized more broadly than human\u2010related failures, AI is perceived\nas out\u2010groups considered by greater homogeneity than in\u2010groups\nof humans (Longoni, Cian, and Kyung 2023). Thus, we intend to\ntest in the last study the moderation role of type of presentation\n(promotional vs. honest) and its impact on the relationship\nbetween different service providers (AI vs. human) on customers\u2019\nbehavioral intention (willingness to engage), as well as reinforce\nresults obtained in the previous studies.\n\n3.4.4 | Results\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a main effect of service\nprovider (F(1, 336) = 45.08, p < 0.01, \u03b7p2 = 0.12) and a main effect\nof presentation type (F(1, 336) = 3.88, p = 0.05, \u03b7p2 = 0.01).\nNotably, these main effects were qualified by a significant\ninteraction between service provider and type of presentation\n(F(1, 336) = 6.36, p = 0.012, \u03b7p2 = 0.02). As explained in Figure 2,\n\n3.4.1 | Participants and Design\n340 participants from the US (47.4% women; Mage = 36.9,\nSD = 14.14) were recruited on Prolific. Study 3 examined the\ninteraction effect of type of service and type of self\u2010promotion\non willingness to engage. It used two (type of service: AI vs.\n\nFIGURE 2 | Willingness to engage as a function of service provider\nand type of presentation.\n\n13 of 20\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

Hence, next we perform a robustness check to shed light on this assumption.\n\n\fTo further investigate the potential impact of AI knowledge, we\nconducted two\u2010way ANCOVAs showing that type of service\nprovider and presentation type continued to significantly\ninteract with willingness to engage, even when controlling for\nAI knowledge (F(1, 335) = 6.10; p < 0.05).\n\n3.4.5 | Mediation Analysis\nTo support the previous results of Study 2, we again examined the\nmediation process through self\u2010discrepancy and trust (Model 6;\nHayes 2013). The bootstrap analysis confirms a significant serial\nmediation effect of self\u2010discrepancy (mediator 1) and trust\n(mediator 2) between service (AI vs. human\u2010based) and customers\u2019\nwillingness to engage. First, the results demonstrate that service\n(AI vs. human\u2010based) significantly impacted self\u2010discrepancy\n(b = \u22121.14, SE = 0.19; p < 0.01). Second, self\u2010discrepancy influenced trust (b = \u22120.42, SE = 0.05; p < 0.01) whereas trust had a\npositive effect on willingness to engage with the service (b = 0.76,\nSE = 0.04; p < 0.01). The total effect was also significant (b = 1.23,\nSE = 0.18; p < 0.01; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.59).\n\n(AI vs. human). Next, the study evaluated the mediating role of\nself\u2010discrepancy on the relationship between service provider and\nwillingness to engage. The results revealed a significant indirect\neffect (b = 0.51, CI: [0.31, 0.74]), supporting results from study 2\n(see Figure 3).\nDue to the previously discovered serial mediation through self\u2010\ndiscrepancy and trust, we ran the second mediation with\nmoderated direct effect with 5,000 bootstraps, 95% confidence\nintervals (Model 5) (Hayes 2018), with the service provider as\nthe independent variable, trust as the mediator, presentation\ntype as the moderator, and willingness to engage as the\ndependent variable. First, the results demonstrated a marginally\nsignificant moderating role of type of presentation (promotional\n(\u20101) vs. honest (1)) on the linkage between service (AI vs.\nhuman\u2010based) and willingness to engage (b = \u22120.22, CI: [\u22120.44,\n0.0054], p = 0.06). When company highlights the exceptional\nqualifications of their employees (AI vs. human), there is no\nsignificant effect on willingness to engage (b = 0.28, CI: [\u22120.05,\n0.62], p = 0.09). Furthermore, when the company uses an\nhonest presentation of a service provider, the results are\ninsignificant as well (b = \u22120.15, CI: [\u22120.47, 0.17], p = 0.37).\nConsequently, there is no moderation effect of presentation type\non the relationships between service provider and willingness to\nengage when the mediator is trust (vs. self\u2010discrepancy). In\ncontrast, the mediating role of trust on the relationship between\nservice provider and willingness to engage had a significant\nindirect effect (b = 1.16, CI: [0.85, 1.47]), supporting results\nfrom study 2.\n\n3.4.6 | Discussion\nNext, to test our proposed process, we ran a mediation with\nmoderated direct effect with 5000 bootstraps, 95% confidence\nintervals (Model 5) (Hayes 2018), with the service provider as the\nindependent variable, self\u2010discrepancy as the mediator, presentation type as the moderator, and willingness to engage as the\ndependent variable (see Figure 3). The model revealed a significant\nmediation with a moderated direct effect. First, the results showed\na significantly negative moderating role of type of presentation\n(promotional (\u22121) vs. honest (1)) on the linkage between service\n(AI vs. human\u2010based) and willingness to engage (b = \u22120.35,\nCI: [\u22120.67, \u22120.03]). When company emphasizes the outstanding\nqualities of their employees (AI vs. human), human service has\nsignificantly higher willingness to engage (b = 1.07, CI: [0.61, 1.54]).\nIn contrast, when the company uses an honest presentation of a\nservice provider, the results are insignificant CI: [\u22120.10, 0.83].\nConsequently, the effect occurs only when the companies\u2019\npromotional activities highlight outstanding employees\u2019 skills\n\nFIGURE 3\n\n14 of 20\n\nStudy 3 provides further support for our main prediction, that\ncustomers have a lower willingness to engage when the company\npresents innovative AI\u2010empowered technology (vs. human\u2010\nbased) (supported H1), and this phenomenon is sequentially\nmediated by self\u2010discrepancy and trust (supported H2). Notably,\nStudy 3 provides novel evidence that differences in a type of\nservice (AI vs. human\u2010based) have a stronger effect on customers\u2019\nwillingness to engage when the presentation is focused on employees\u2019 outstanding skills (supported H3). The results revealed a\nsignificant moderating role of presentation type (promotional vs.\nhonest) on the linkage between service (AI vs. human\u2010based)\n(independent variable) and willingness to engage (dependent\nvariable) when the mediator is self\u2010discrepancy.\nThese results align with sentiment analyses (preliminary study),\nwhere we found no correlation between customer reactions\n\n| Mediation through self\u2010discrepancy with moderated direct effect.\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

Conversely, there was no\ndifference in willingness to engage with the service provided by\nAI when company promotes AI capabilities (M = 5.79, SD =\n2.00) and when it did not (M = 5.89, SD = 1.85; F(1, 336) = 0.152,\np = 0.696).\n\n\f4 | General Discussion\nThis article aims to explore a novel perspective on how customers perceive companies\u2019 self\u2010promotional dilemmas regarding\nAI and human\u2010based resources. Research to date has focused\nmainly on self\u2010promotion of humans (Den Hartog, De Hoogh,\nand Belschak 2020; Gross et al. 2021) or companies\u2019 impression\nmanagement (Bass et al. 2023; Jin, Li, and Hoskisson 2022),\nsuggesting that such efforts can also be perceived negatively as\nbragging (Scopelliti, Loewenstein, and Vosgerau 2015). The\ncurrent research adds to our understanding of customers perception of self\u2010promotional signals based on a companies\u2019 presentation of AI (vs. human\u2010based) service. The findings suggest\nthat when companies use self\u2010promotion to signal their valuable\nresources (AI vs. human) to customers, the resources, such as AI\u2010\ndriven technologies, tend to be perceived less favorably in comparison to similar signals about human\u2010based service. This difference in perception can be attributed to self\u2010discrepancy and\ntrust between their expectations of human\u2010like service interactions and the reality of AI capabilities. In other words, customers\nfind it challenging to affiliate their expectations with AI as\neffectively as they do with human service due to AI aversion\n(Castelo, Bos, and Lehmann 2019; Granulo, Fuchs, and\nPuntoni 2019; Reich, Kaju, and Maglio 2023).\nMoreover, our findings underscore the importance of refining\ncommunication strategies about companies\u2019 AI\u2010related services\nto align with customer expectations and to bridge the gap in\nhow self\u2010promotion is received in the digital age. We provide\ninitial empirical evidence that promotion of companies\u2019\nAI\u2010based valuable resources can evoke negative customer's\nperceptions, represented through lower willingness to engage\nwith service and higher perception of this promotion being\nexaggerated and seen as bragging. Specifically, when it comes to\nhuman\u2010based resources, highlighting the resource's strengths\n(i.e., self\u2010promotion framing) yields a higher willingness to\nengage compared to a more honest framing. Interestingly, in the\ncontext of AI\u2010based service promotion customers seem to reflect\na certain indifference, perceiving both promotional strategies in\na similar manner. Overall, our paper reveals the dilemma that\ncompanies must face when engaging in self\u2010promotional signaling related to their service providers (AI vs. human). While\nself\u2010promotion is a crucial component of marketing and brand\nbuilding, our results suggest that companies need to be cautious\nin their messaging to avoid reducing customer engagement with\nAI\u2010based services.\n\n4.1 | Theoretical Implications\nThe findings offer important theoretical contributions to the understanding of AI and the communication of company resources.\nFirst, we contribute to signaling theory (Connelly et al. 2011;\nGriskevicius, Tybur, and Van den Bergh 2010). Research to date\nhas leveraged signaling theory to show customer acceptance of\nAI\u2010enabled voice assistants (VA) theorizing about VA features as\nsignals (Guha et al. 2023), or applied signaling theory to examine\nwhether human\u2013AI teaming impacts customer acceptance of\nchatbots (Li et al. 2024). In line with these works, self\u2010\npromotional signals are used to determine a particular reputation\nwith a target audience. Specifically, if successfully executed, such\nsignals may positively influence the target's opinion (Chen and\nFang 2008). In contrast, our research presents the first empirical\nevidence that self\u2010promotion of companies\u2019 AI\u2010empowered service can foster more negative perceptions among customers such\nas bragging and exaggeration. This effect, which may seem surprising, could be attributed to the fact that self\u2010promotion is\ntypically perceived as a human form of communication\n(Chaudhry and Loewenstein 2019), whereas AI\u2010based technologies are often seen as lacking the ability to embody human traits\n(Lu, Zhang, and Zhang 2021; S\u00f6derlund and Oikarinen 2021).\nRespondents credited positive outcomes rather than human (vs.\nAI\u2010based) self\u2010promotion. Noteworthy is also that research to date\non self\u2010promotional signals has largely focused on a human perspective (e.g., Scopelliti, Loewenstein, and Vosgerau 2015;\nSezer 2022), but not included AI agents as a basis of self\u2010\npromotional activities. Overall, we extend work on signaling\ntheory applied to other technology realms (e.g., Guha et al. 2023;\nGuo et al. 2020; Li et al. 2024) by integrating self\u2010promotional\nsignals into the discourse and demonstrating that customer perceptions of those signals can differ depending on if they are\nassociated with AI versus human\u2010based service provisions.\nSecond, we bridge signaling theory (Connelly et al. 2011;\nGriskevicius, Tybur, and Van den Bergh 2010) and RBV\n(Barney 1991; Kraaijenbrink, Spender, and Groen 2010) by\nshowing that the perceived value of companies\u2019 resources can\nfluctuate based on how they are signaled and promoted to customers. This, in turn, determines whether these resources are\nseen as a source of competitive advantage in the eyes of customers. Some studies have drawn on RBV to elucidate the way in\nwhich firms' AI adoption impacts competitive advantage and\nperformance (Krakowski, Luger, and Raisch 2023), or discuss a\nconnection between companies\u2019 AI pursuits and competitive\nadvantage (Kemp 2024). However, our study enriches the theoretical realm in the service domain by being the first to merge\nboth signaling theory and RBV, while introducing a distinction\nbetween AI and human\u2010based service provisions. Moreover, we\nfurther demonstrate a boundary condition of the type of presentation (promotional vs. honest) demonstrating that highlighting\nthe AI's outstanding features or honestly admitting that AI has\nlimitations does not seem to influence customers. However, when\npromoting human resources, self\u2010enhancing promotional efforts\nare perceived more positively by customers. As such, we provide a\nmore refined understanding of how signals of valuable resources\ncan benefit from different promotional strategies.\nThird, we also present a more nuanced understanding of the\nmain phenomenon being tested by showing that the effects are\n15 of 20\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

Similarly, respondents here showed no preference between AI promotional and\nhonest presentations. This shows that companies\u2019 self\u2010\npromotional signals, which are focused on the outstanding\ncapabilities of an employee, have a positive impact on willingness to engage. However, when trust was presented as a\nmediator in the same moderated mediation model, it did not\nyield a significant effect across levels of the moderator, nor did\nit support trust functioning as part of a moderated mediation.\nThis indicated that while trust could mediate the relationship\nindependently, it was ineffective when included in a model that\nrequired simultaneous interaction with the moderator.\n\n\fadmitting some of its limitations does not seem to have an\nimpact on customers' willingness to engage with the service\nprovider. Although we did not specifically test for it, as customers get accustomed to AI\u2010based service provisions and\nhuman\u2010AI interactions are seen as more useful, customers'\nperceptions of self\u2010promotion of AI services may improve.\nHence, it may still be worth promoting, although progressively,\nAI\u2010based service provisions.\nIn addition, as mentioned above, our findings suggest that\ncustomers frequently interpret AI\u2010related self\u2010promotional signals as overt bragging, highlighting a disconnect and lower trust\nin the perception of promotional intent between businesses and\ntheir clientele. Customers tend to resonate with narratives\ninvolving human expertise, making them more receptive to\ncompanies\u2019 human's self\u2010promotions. This discrepancy in customers\u2019 perspective underscores the importance of aligning\nmarketing self\u2010promotional strategies with customers\u2019 preferences to foster more effective communication signaling. This\nwould potentially entail the retention and investment into further developing their human assets, which should then be also\ncommunicated clearly to their customers. Therefore, companies\nshould emphasize the achievements of their employees over AI\u2010\nempowered services to increase customers' interest in interacting with them. Such an approach is particularly important for\nservice industry where the human touch can \u201cdisplay unique\nbrand\u2010building behaviors\u201d (Larivi\u00e8re et al. 2017, p. 241).\n\n4.2 | Managerial Implications\n4.3 | Limitations and further Research\nBusinesses aim to succeed in the market by seeking out the\nmost capable and competent professionals (Mawdsley and\nSomaya 2016; Ployhart 2006). Employees\u2019 skills and knowledge\nare companies\u2019 valuable resources, providing a sustained competitive advantage (Barney 1991; Kraaijenbrink, Spender, and\nGroen 2010). These resources are a crucial strategic opportunity\nfor increasing competitive abilities (Ployhart 2006). However,\nnowadays the adoption of the most advanced technology, such\nas AI, is a recipe for success (Esmaeilzadeh and Vaezi 2022).\nThis leads companies, including service companies, to engage\nin self\u2010promotion of both their human and innovative AI\nresources to the public (Castillo 2024).\nHowever, we discover that not all competitive resources (AI and\nhuman capital) should be communicated equally \u2010 customers\nare not very concerned about the fact that AI is promoted as the\nbest solution or is presented with certain disadvantages\n(promotional vs. honest presentation). Despite this notable\nfinding, to promote expensive AI\u2010based services, companies\ninvest huge amounts of money in their marketing and self\u2010\npromotion, instead of developing human capital. We are not\ncalling for companies to abandon development and investment\nin the AI service industry, but our research aims to uncover the\nnegative circumstances of companies\u2019 self\u2010promotion of their\ninnovative tools such as AI. Companies in the service sector\nwould still be advised to highlight the use of humans in their\nservice provisions. Boosting the image of human service providers amplifies customers' willingness to engage and does not\nprovoke the negative perception of such promotion as bragging.\nFurther, if companies self\u2010promote their AI\u2010based services, they\nneed to be aware that focusing on the AI's great abilities or even\n16 of 20\n\nThis research has some limitations that can inspire future work.\nFirst, we encourage future research to examine moderators that\ncan significantly affect the strength or direction of the mediated\nrelationship. Our investigation focused on service\u2010oriented scenarios, where the presence of humans in self\u2010promotional initiatives is still critical, due to customers' appreciation of the\nhuman touch (Larivi\u00e8re et al. 2017). In contrast, customers may\nbe more receptive toward the use of AI technologies in product\u2010\nfocused businesses with more specific contexts of AI applications\n(e.g., the automotive industry). Thus, self\u2010promotion of AI technologies by such businesses may be perceived more positively by\ncustomers. Furthermore, recent work suggests that cultural differences in AI acceptance and self\u2010promotion may exist (e.g., Chi\net al. 2023; Sheldon et al. 2017). Thus, future investigations could\nexamine if our findings are consistent across the globe.\nSecond, we also encourage further research to explore AI's\nthinking versus feeling skills as a boundary condition of our\neffects. Customers generally perceive AI as very capable of\nperforming thinking tasks, but for feeling tasks they may still\nprefer humans (Huang and Rust 2022; Vorobeva et al. 2022),\nwhich is likely influencing their perceptions of self\u2010promotional\nefforts. However, the emergence of Generative AI and its ability\nto be used for human\u2010like communication, which makes it the\nnew feeling AI (Huang and Rust 2024), may offer further\nresearch opportunities. Moreover, we acknowledge potential\nlimitations related to the construction of our scenarios, as subtle\ndifferences in how participants perceive AI versus human\nclaims could influence their responses in ways that scenario\ndesign cannot fully control.\nPsychology & Marketing, 2025\n\n15206793, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.22198 by Macquarie University, Wiley Online Library on [11/02/2025].

Prior work\non self\u2010discrepancy identified different strategies by which customers deal with self\u2010discrepancy, one of which is dissociation,\n\u201cbehavior that separates oneself from products or service\u201d\n(Mandel et al. 2017, p. 6). Our research further builds on these\nworks, revealing a noteworthy dissociation in customer perception when it comes to self\u2010promotional signals related to AI as\nopposed to the self\u2010promotion of a human employee. We recognize that companies\u2019 signals about AI (vs. human\u2010based) service increase self\u2010discrepancy. This also ties in with the notion of\nAI aversion (Castelo, Bos, and Lehmann 2019; Granulo, Fuchs,\nand Puntoni 2019; Reich, Kaju, and Maglio 2023), thus reducing\nwillingness to engage and increasing the perception of self\u2010\npromotional signals as bragging. Moreover, prior research has\nidentified trust as a key factor influencing AI aversion and customers\u2019 reluctance to adopt AI\u2010driven technologies (Davenport\net al. 2020; Kim, Giroux, and Lee 2021; Seegebarth, Backhaus,\nand Woisetschl\u00e4ger 2019). Our research extends this understanding by revealing that trust, as a consequence of self\u2010\ndiscrepancy, remains equally critical in the context of a company's self\u2010promotional activities. Overall, these findings complement existing work on the relationship between artificial\nagents and customers (Davenport et al. 2020; Puntoni et al. 2021;\nSchepers et al. 2022) demonstrating that self\u2010discrepancy and the\nresulting trust is not exclusive to human\u2010to\u2010human interaction,\nbut it also occurs between human and artificial entities.\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by national funds through FCT (Foundation for\nScience and Technology), under the project \u2010 UIDB/04152/2020 (DOI:\n10.54499/UIDB/04152/2020) \u2010 Information Management Research Centre\n(MagIC)/NOVA IMS and 2021.09496.

We account for relevant dissimilarities, indicating where conceptual boundaries may be drawn. Guided by a \u201creasoning by analogy\u201d approach, the article\naddresses the structural analogy and machinewashing idiosyncrasies leading to a novel and theoretically informed model of\nmachinewashing. Consequently, machinewashing is defined as a strategy that organizations adopt to engage in misleading\nbehavior (communication and/or action) about ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI)/algorithmic systems. Machinewashing\ninvolves misleading information about ethical AI communicated or omitted via words, visuals, or the underlying algorithm of\nAI itself. Furthermore, and going beyond greenwashing, machinewashing may be used for symbolic actions such as (covert)\nlobbying and prevention of stricter regulation. By outlining diverse theoretical foundations of the established greenwashing\ndomain and their relation to specific research questions, the article proposes a machinewashing model and a set of theoryrelated research questions on the macro, meso, and micro-level for future machinewashing research. We conclude by stressing\nlimitations and by outlining practical implications for organizations and policymakers.\nKeywords Machinewashing \u00b7 Greenwashing \u00b7 AI ethics \u00b7 Corporate political activity \u00b7 Decoupling \u00b7 Agency theory\n\nIntroduction\nAutomation, digitization, and machine learning have irreversibly entered the scene. However, at the moment, it\nremains unpredictable what impact, what level of disruption, and which threats and benefits digital technology will\ncontribute to business and society. Hopes and fears, utopian\nand dystopian visions are equally discussed. Particularly,\nethical questions arising from machine intelligence are prevalent and trending. But it is not all (ethical) gold that shines:\nKevin Roose (2019) reported for the New York Times, from\n* Mario D.

The media scandal\nthat followed her exit and the firing of her co-head Margaret Mitchell has provoked broad skepticism about the actual\nreality behind corporate AI ethics programs (Johnson, 2021;\nVincent, 2021). As a consequence, critical observers have\ndrawn associations with a well-established business ethics\nconcept, labeling AI ethics as \u201cmachinewashing\u201d\u2014derived\nfrom greenwashing as misleading environmental communication by companies (Obradovich et al., 2019). Now, what is\nmachinewashing? The term has first been coined by Wagner\n(2018) and further refined by researchers from MIT Media\nLab in a Boston Globe article, stressing that it represents a\nnew form of greenwashing used to \u201c[a]ddressing widespread\nconcerns about the pernicious downsides of artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014robots taking jobs, fatal autonomous-vehicle\ncrashes, racial bias in criminal sentencing, the ugly polarization of the 2018 election\u2014tech giants are working hard to\nassure us of their good intentions surrounding AI. But some\nof their public relations campaigns are creating the surface\nillusion of positive change without the verifiable reality. Call\nit \u201c\u2018machinewashing\u2019\u201d (Obradovich et al., 2019).\nMachinewashing is closely related to or used interchangeably with competing concepts that emerged in parallel: AI\nwashing, (AI) ethics washing, ethical white washing, ethics bluewashing, and ethics theater (see Table 2). Given the\nevolving status of the discussion, research into the ethical\nissues raised by machinewashing is still in an early stage.\nAgainst this background, we reason by analogy to bring\n\n13\n\nconceptual clarity into the machinewashing domain, bridging it with the established greenwashing domain (Cornelissen & Durand, 2014; Ketokivi et al., 2017; Vaughan, 2014).\nThus, the guiding research questions of this article are: What\nare the antecedents, outcomes, idiosyncrasies, and underlying practices of machinewashing, where the source domain\nof greenwashing can inform the target domain of machinewashing (Ketokivi et al., 2017; Nersessian, 2008)? Furthermore, we ask: What are the similarities and differences,\nwhere the analogy does not fit, and where machinewashing\ngoes beyond greenwashing given the disruptive momentum\nof AI? In other words, we analyze salient properties and relations that allow for transferring knowledge from the structural analogous greenwashing field. In addition, we stress\nthe limitations of such a transfer in light of diverging theory\nassumptions that reveal unique characteristics of machinewashing and its distinct conceptual boundaries (Alvesson &\nSandberg, 2011). Consequently, we summarize a conceptual\nmodel of machinewashing (see Fig. 1; Table 3) as a guiding\nframework that helps to organize and describe the various\nunderstandings and implications of machinewashing.\nAlthough a scientific concept definition of machinewashing may help better understand its underlying practices and trigger focused (empirical) research, few attempts\nhave been made to provide a concept definition (Nersessian, 2008). Therefore, machinewashing is defined as a\nstrategy that organizations adopt to engage in misleading\nbehavior (communication and/or action) about ethical\n\n\f1065\n\nFrom Greenwashing to Machinewashing: A Model and Future Directions Derived from Reasoning\u2026\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)/algorithmic systems. Machinewashing involves misleading information about ethical AI\ncommunicated or omitted via words, visuals, or the underlying algorithm of AI itself. Furthermore, and going beyond\ngreenwashing, machinewashing may be used for symbolic\nactions such as (covert) lobbying and prevention of stricter\nregulation.\nGiven the relevance and strength of the link between the\ngreenwashing and machinewashing domain, we outline a\nresearch program that builds on the analogy-derived model\nas a foundation (Ketokivi et al., 2017). As greenwashing\noccurred in a range of literatures, we show how the analogy\nlinks to multiple domains and opens the way for empirical\nstudy of the diverse machinewashing practices (Table 4 and\n5). Thus, we provide evidence of the analogy's structural\nsoundness and factual validity, encouraging future research\nand interdisciplinary dialog about machinewashing with a\nset of possible research questions on the macro, meso, and\nmicro-level (Ketokivi et al., 2017). We emphasize that the\nsuggested theory domains should not be seen as an exhaustive list but as an initial starting point to advance our understandings of machinewashing and broaden the scope of the\nresearch program (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2011; Ketokivi\net al., 2017). Finally, we discuss broader avenues for future\nresearch and practical implications.\n\nConceptual Comparison of Greenwashing\nand Machinewashing\nAnalogies are central to management and organizational\ntheories (Cornelissen & Durand, 2014; Ketokivi et al., 2017;\nSwedberg 2014; Vaughan, 2014). Many important theories\nthat evolved in previous decades build on analogies to introduce new ideas, provide explanations and comprehensive\ninsights into complex subjects, and trigger scientific discourse (Astley & Zammuto, 1992; Cornelissen, 2005; Williamson, 1971). An analogy typically links a source and a\ntarget domain through structural mapping, thereby utilizing\nthe knowledge of the source to draw implications in the target domain (Ketokivi et al., 2017). In the following, we reason by analogy to connect the machinewashing domain with\nthe source domain of greenwashing. To do so, we invoke a\nstructural mapping that connects and transfers elements from\nthe greenwashing debate to corresponding elements of the\nmachinewashing discourse to ultimately arrive at a new and\ntheoretically informed model of machinewashing (Gentner\n& Smith, 2012; Ketokivi et al., 2017; Nersessian, 2008;\nVaughan, 2014). It is essential to be aware of the potential\nlimits of such a knowledge transfer, given the distinct characteristics of the machinewashing phenomenon. A helpful\nway to approach this challenge is Alvesson and Sandberg\u2019s\n(2011) problematization strategy to identify and contest core\n\nassumptions underlying a given domain.1 Thus, we use the\nproblematization approach as an important means to stress\nthe boundaries of the analogy, bringing forth salient elements of the machinewashing phenomenon.\n\nGreenwashing and Machinewashing:\nState\u2011of\u2011the\u2011Art and Core Assumptions\nGreenwashing\nIn 1986, the biologist Jay Westerveld coined the term greenwashing, referring to the hotel industry's misleading practice\nof promoting the reuse of towels to save water and, thus,\nto conserve planetary resources (Becker-Olsen & Potucek,\n2013). Whereas corporate communication emphasized an\nenvironmentally friendly image, the actual business intention to reduce laundry costs and increase profits remained\nin the dark (Orange, 2010). In this regard, greenwashing\nemerged as a concept that discusses corporate activities\nand practices that make \u201can organization look more environmentally friendly than it actually is\u201d (Becker-Olsen &\nPotucek, 2013, p. 1318). Since its inception, the greenwashing concept has gained substantial traction in business ethics and related literatures, with several authors identifying\nand refining its boundaries. Table 1 summarizes the various\nacademic and non-academic definitions of greenwashing\nand shows that today's understandings of greenwashing have\nbecome broader in scope,2 going beyond a single focus on\n\u201cthe unjustified appropriation of environmental virtue by a\ncompany to create a pro-environmental image\u201d (Marciniak,\n2010, p. 49), covering also societal aspects, \u201ci.e. merely\nbusinesses claiming environmental credentials and other\nsocial contributions while continuing to generate excessive\nharms such as social costs, i.e. \u2018business as usual\u2019\u201d (Sheehy,\n2014, p. 626). The underlying core assumptions of the greenwashing domain can be summarized as follows. Greenwashing is: (1) \u201cfocused on information disclosure decisions,\u201d\n(2) \u201cassumed to be a deliberate strategy,\u201d (3) \u201cconceived\nprimarily as a corporate phenomenon,\u201d and (4) \u201cusually\nassumed to be beneficial for firms and detrimental to society (environment)\u201d (5) relates to social and environmental\n\n1\n\nWithin the limited space of this paper, we focus on the crucial\nsecond step of the problematization approach: the identification and\narticulation of core assumptions. For a full outline of all stages of the\nproblematization strategy, chapter 5 of Alvesson and Sandberg (2013)\nmay be considered.\n2\nFor the purpose of this research, we adopt a wide understanding\nof greenwashing, which goes beyond mere symbolic communication\nabout environmental aspects, and also covers various social dimensions, as the more recent term \u201cCSR washing\u201d underlines (Pope and\nW\u00e6raas 2016).\n\n13\n\n\f13\nGreenwashing, n\n\nOxford English Dictionary (2012)\n\nThe harm of symbolic actions and green-washing: corporate actions and\ncommunications on environmental performance and their financial\nimplications\nGreenwashing revisited: in search of at typology and accusation-based\ndefinition incorporating legitimacy strategies\nAfter greenwashing: symbolic corporate environmentalism and society\nGreenwashing as an example of ecological marketing misleading practices\n\nWalker and Wan (2012, p. 227)\n\nMarciniak (2010, p. 49)\n\nScrutiny, norms, and selective disclosure: a global study of greenwashing\nA path analysis of greenwashing in a trust crisis among Chinese energy\ncompanies: the role of brand legitimacy and brand loyalty\nDefining CSR: problems and solutions\n\nMarquis et al.

Seele, M. D. Schultz\n\n\f1067\n\nFrom Greenwashing to Machinewashing: A Model and Future Directions Derived from Reasoning\u2026\n\nissues (Bowen, 2014, p. 26). From the established greenwashing source domain, we will now turn toward the target\ndomain of machinewashing, depicting similarities its unique\ncharacteristics.\n\nMachinewashing\nHas only recently entered the business ethics research\nagenda in light of the widespread implementation of AI\nsystems and rising concerns over the adverse impacts of\nAI (Benkler, 2019). Although machinewashing and similar\nconcepts (see Table 2) are increasingly gaining momentum,\nthe academic discourse around them remains dispersed.\nCurrent discussions are located at the intercept of multiple\nfields, including AI/machine ethics, information ethics, digital ethics, bioethics, robot ethics, and international law and\ngovernance literature. Considering existing machinewashing\ndefinitions (Table 2) along with the above-listed assumptions\nof greenwashing, one can see strong similarities, but also differences, where alternative assumptions may emerge (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2011): Machinewashing is a practice that:\n(1) focuses on information disclosure in the form of communicative activities using ethical language directed at various\nstakeholders (e.g., disclosure of ethics principles and guidelines); (2) focuses on misleading actions (e.g., symbolic and\nlobbying activities); (3) is seen as a deliberate practice; (3) is\nunderstood as an organizational phenomenon closely related\ntechnology firms, but not exclusively; (4) assumed to be benefit organizations while being detrimental for society; (6)\nrelates to AI issues. Given that AI or algorithmic system\nissues mark the crucial difference, where machinewashing\nand greenwashing assumptions depart, a few words are in\norder to detail these salient elements (Alvesson & Sandberg,\n2011).\n\nIdiosyncrasies of Machinewashing\nMachinewashing should not be considered a mere extension of greenwashing. At its core, machinewashing relates to\nbroader AI issues, which warrant treating machinewashing\nas a distinct phenomenon rather than a digital version of\ngreenwashing (see Table 2). Thus, the presented conceptual\nanalogy is informed by the following peculiarities that characterize machinewashing concerning these broader AI issues\n(Ketokivi et al., 2017; Nersessian, 2008).\n\nDisruptive AI\nAI topics touch the general public and business's surface\nonly within a few years. With the substantial advancements\nof computer technologies and increased processing power of\nmodern microchips, machine learning and other advanced\n\nalgorithmic systems have been developed and deployed on a\nlarge scale throughout society (Appenzeller, 2017; Crawford\n& Calo, 2016). Thus, machinewashing rapidly emerged just\nas the digital transformation did and does, disrupting societal values and legal systems rather than gradually changing them, as in the case of greenwashing (Becker-Olsen &\nPotucek, 2013).\n\nBroad Scope and Scalability\nAI use cases are only limited by designers' imagination, as\nthe wide deployment and scalability across many areas of\ndaily life show. Neurosurgical procedures, facial recognition, and speech synthesis systems to identify and imitate\nhumans, self-driving cars, chatbots that respond to consumer\nemotions, or pre-trial risk assessments in courtrooms are all\nexamples of systems featuring AI (Chesney & Citron, 2019;\nHao, 2019; Hao & Stray, 2019; Huang & Rust, 2021a; Yuste\net al., 2017). Thus, given the broad range of use cases, the\nspectrum for potential machinewashing becomes much more\nexpansive than in the case of greenwashing.\n\nLack of Societal and Governmental Watchdogs\nCharacteristic for the emergence of greenwashing were\nnewly formed civil society organizations and NGOs that\naimed to point out corporations' adverse social and environmental impacts and hold them accountable (Becker-Olsen\n& Potucek, 2013; Sheehy, 2014). Further, dedicated governmental \u201cwatchdog\u201d institutions evolved in several jurisdictions (see, e.g., Department for Environment Food and\nRural Affairs (DEFRA) 2010; Federal Trade Commission\n(FTC) 2012). In contrast, when it comes to AI issues and\nmachinewashing, apart from a few examples (see, e.g., AlgorithmWatch and Opendatawatch) civil society organizations\nand dedicated machinewashing watchdogs are still lacking\n(Koene et al., 2019).\n\nTangibility of AI Issues\nThe greenwashing phenomenon emerged in light of increasing attention for highly visible social and environmental\nproblems, such as sweatshop working conditions and environmental degradation (Beder, 2002; Lim & Phillips, 2008).\nThese social and green issues have a \u2018feel\u2019 and visibility. In\ncontrast, issues related to machinewashing are much more\nabstract. Challenges associated with AI, such as privacy,\nalgorithmic biases, discrimination, job loss, power- and\ninformation asymmetries, are often not apparent at first\nglance (Rust & Huang, 2021; Seele et al., 2021; Theodorou\n& Dignum, 2020). In other words, an oil spill in the Gulf\nof Mexico draws much greater attention than a data privacy\n\n13\n\n\f13\nEthics as an escape from regulation: from ethics-washing to ethicsshopping?\n\nBeware corporate \u2018machinewashing\u2019 of AI\n\nFrom ethics washing to ethics bashing: a view on tech ethics from within\nmoral philosophy\nAgainst ethical AI\n\nAI ethics should not remain toothless!

Consequently,\nalso machinewashing becomes less palpable.\n\nOpacity and Complexity of AI: Difficult to Grasp\nfor Stakeholders\nThe abstract nature of issues related to the machinewashing\nphenomenon is partly due to the underlying complexity of\nAI systems (Hagendorff, 2019). Although some corporations make efforts to provide insights into their algorithms,\ntheir precise functioning is undoubtedly not evident, even for\nexperts (Crawford & Calo, 2016; Jordan & Mitchell, 2015).\nAI systems remain black boxes for most stakeholders, often\nshielded by property rights (Martin, 2019; Noto La Diega,\n2018). Consequently, the exact functionality of AI remains\nlargely unknown and difficult to grasp, which makes opacity and complexity also crucial aspects of machinewashing.\n\nFluid Algorithms\nAI-powered products or services are based on different\nforms of algorithms. As such, AI is difficult to grasp due to\nthe fluid nature of the underlying algorithmic code (Buhmann et al., 2020). Especially machine learning system\nadapt their behavior to a context in real time (Yeung et al.,\n2020). Thus, rather than being associated with concrete or\neven tangible products as in greenwashing, AI can easily\nchange shape via software updates, patches, or an altered\ndeployment environment (Yeung, 2019). As a consequence,\nthe machinewashing of AI products and services becomes\nmore challenging to capture and follow.\n\nAutomated Decision Making and Unknown\nConsequences\nAt the core of AI systems is the possibility to automate processes and decision making with algorithms. Although AI,\nby definition, emerges from human design, its developing\nor deploying organization often slides into the background\n(Bryson, 2020). Further, algorithmic decision-making outcomes are not always what designers and organizations want\nor have planned for. Especially machine learning systems\ndesigned to develop independently and in real time carry the\nrisk of triggering unintended or undesirable consequences\n(Wagner & Winkler, 2019). Thus, AI goes along with unpredictability and raises new responsibility questions when\nmaking independent or semi-automated (Coeckelbergh,\n2020). In turn, the issue of unintended outcomes and the\nproblem of responsibility translates to the machinewashing\nphenomenon.\nIn light of the depicted idiosyncrasies, the following paragraphs will structurally map the source and target domain\nto indicate fundamental relations that allow for a knowledge\n\n13\n\nP. Seele, M. D. Schultz\n\ntransfer between green and machinewashing (Gentner\n& Smith, 2012; Ketokivi et al., 2017; Nersessian, 2008;\nVaughan, 2014). By building on five major dimensions, we\nstress the analogy and indicate where new ways of thinking\nare required to account for machinewashing idiosyncrasies\n(see Fig. 1; Table 3): (1) Antecedents (2) Underlying Goals\n(3) Practice (4) Examples and Manifestations (5) Outcomes.\n\nAntecedents\nGreenwashing\nGreenwashing and machinewashing are both subject to antecedents that stem from the external and internal corporate\nenvironment. As depicted by Delmas and Burbano (2011),\nthe external environment can be characterized as the nonmarket environment that includes the regulatory and broader\npublic (e.g., the media), as well as the market environment\n(consumers, financiers, competitors). The internal environment includes organizational and individual psychological\ndrivers that are summarized in Sect. (2) underlying goals.\nPrevious research has identified the uncertain regulatory\nenvironment as a key driver of greenwashing, which indirectly touches on all other greenwashing drivers (Delmas\n& Burbano, 2011). Further, external drivers include pressure upon the corporation by activist groups, NGOs, and the\nmedia (Marciniak, 2010). Also, a company's institutional or\noperational context can be a decisive aspect in terms of prevalent industry norms and competitor practices (Du, 2014;\nJones, 2012). Additionally, consumer and investor demands\nplay a crucial role as drivers in the market environment (Delmas & Burbano, 2011; Sheehy, 2014).\n\nMachinewashing\nThe uncertain regulatory context is also the most crucial\ninstitutional driver of corporate machinewashing in the nonmarket external environment (Benkler, 2019; Jobin et al.,\n2019; Wagner, 2018). This regulatory void has invited\nnumerous organizations to launch soft-law initiatives making extensive but unsubstantiated ethical claims about their\nAI systems without having to risk any legal charges (Bietti,\n2020; Jobin et al., 2019). Similar to greenwashing, in the\nnonmarket external environment, activist groups, NGOs,\nand the media play a role as monitors of machinewashing\n(Kinstler, 2020; McMillan & Brown, 2019). In terms of\nthe external market environment, industry norms, competition, and consumers and investors are crucial external market dimensions to consider in the machinewashing debate.\nAs pressure from these groups may trigger corporations to\nengage in symbolic communication about their AI practices\n(Mittelstadt, 2019).\n\n\fFrom Greenwashing to Machinewashing: A Model and Future Directions Derived from Reasoning\u2026\n\n1071\n\nTable 3\u2002\u2009Machinewashing\u2014model overview\nIdiosyncrasies of\nMachinewashing\n\nAntecedents\nUnderlying goals\n\nPractice*\nOutcomes\n\nDefinition\n\nMachinewashing emerged rapidly along new and disruptive AI systems, challenging societal values and legal systems\nBroad range of AI use cases opens wide spectrum for machinewashing\nLack of dedicated civil society and governmental watchdogs\nAI issues (privacy, algorithmic biases, discrimination etc.) and machinewashing not tangible at first glance\nOpacity and complexity of AI difficult to grasp for stakeholders.

Machinewashing involves misleading\ninformation about ethical AI communicated or omitted via words, visuals, or the underlying algorithm of AI itself.\nFurthermore, and going beyond greenwashing, machinewashing may be used for symbolic actions such as (covert)\nlobbying and prevention of stricter regulation\n\n*For a detailed overview of machinewashing types and practices, see Table 4\n\nUnderlying Goals\nGreenwashing\nUnderlying goals may be instrumental or normative in\nnature and relate to the firm\u2019s response to the external\nenvironment and depend on the internal organizational\nenvironment, including firm characteristics, incentive\nstructures, and the ethical climate (Delmas & Burbano,\n2011). Benefits arising from a green image include reputational gains and a potential competitive advantage and\nincreased willingness to pay, mainly connected to large\nand highly visible firms (Matejek & G\u00f6ssling, 2014; Szabo\n& Webster, 2020). Moreover, business legitimacy to build\nor maintain what has been termed the social license to\noperate remains a crucial underlying goal (Suchman,\n1995; Walker & Wan, 2012). Moreover, organizational and\nindividual psychological characteristics and the bounded\nrationality of agents can help explain greenwashing goals\n\n(Delmas & Burbano, 2011; Verbeke & Greidanus, 2009;\nWalker & Wan, 2012).\n\nMachinewashing\nMachinewashing follows similar goals. The AI ethics debate\nstresses the corporate quest for reputational gains, a competitive advantage, and business legitimacy (Benkler, 2019;\nBietti, 2020; Douek, 2019; Koene et al., 2019). Additionally,\ntechnology corporations are driven by the incentive to maintain power and authority, triggering increased engagement in\nmachinewashing (Kalluri, 2020). Given that algorithms and\ndata are crucial to corporate success, large-scale and highly\nvisible technology corporations have a general interest in\nmaintaining control over these resources and the broader AI\nethics debate (Floridi, 2019; Zuboff, 2019). Analogous to\ngreenwashing, individual agents, in the form of managerial\ndirectors, may follow bounded rational agendas, triggering\n\n13\n\n\f1072\n\nmachinewashing (Papazoglou, 2019; Roose, 2019; Satariano, 2020).\n\nPractice\nGreenwashing\nGreenwashing represents a symbolic communication gesture\nto create an unfounded or misleading pro-environmental or\npro-social image (Laufer, 2003; Marciniak, 2010). The primary actor is the corporation making false or misleading\nclaims about environmental and social attributes of products,\nservices, and the organization\u2019s social and environmental\nperformance. Whether a claim or corporate action is deceptive also depends on the audience's overall impression, as\n\u201cgreenwash is truly in the eye of the beholder\u201d (Lyon &\nMontgomery, 2015, p. 6). To further specify greenwashing practices, it is helpful to look into existing regulations.\nSeveral types of false or misleading claims are the focus\nof regulatory standards and practice guidelines, issued by\nthe U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) (2012), the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2011),\nthe Canadian Standards Association (CSA) (2008), and the\nUK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n(DEFRA) (2010). Next to these public institutions, several\nNGOs and public/private sector organizations provide indicators that help to identify greenwashing: the Greenpeace\nGreenwash Criteria, the Greenwashing Index of EnviroMedia and the University of Oregon, the Seven sins of greenwashing by Terrachoice, and Futerra\u2019s signs of greenwashing\n(Zanasi et al., 2017). The most detailed outline of greenwashing types is provided by Lyon and Montgomery (2015),\nlisting 11 mechanisms, also covering greenwashing as a nonmarket strategy that is (astroturf) lobbying. Summarizing\nthese sources, greenwashing practices can be distinguished\naccording to different categories or types of misleading\nbehavior (see Table 4):\n(1) Misleading with words, which may include (a) misleading claims (b) inaccurate claims (c) vague/unprovable\nclaims (d) meaningless claims (d) overstatements/exaggerations\n(2) Misleading with visuals or graphics. This aspect relates\nto various forms of visual rhetoric and semiotics. It\nalso covers false or misleading seals, certifications, and\nlabels.\n(3) Misleading by omission. Noteworthy in this regard are\ncorporate practices that relate to (a) complete omission\nof information, (b) selective disclosure, (c) incomplete\ncomparisons (d) masking of information.\n\n13\n\nP. Seele, M. D. Schultz\n\n(4) Mislead with symbolic action refers to an inconsistency\nbetween promises about, e.g., social and environmental\ninitiatives and actual actions in this regard.\n(5) Mislead with (covert) lobbying. This category involves\nopen or covert nonmarket activities aimed at favorable\nlaws and regulations.\n\nMachinewashing\nMachinewashing practices match the above types of misleading behavior (see Table 4) and are further informed by\nthe machinewashing idiosyncrasies (see Fig. 1; Table 3).\nMachinewashing includes the use of vague, inaccurate,\nand meaningless claims as well as jargon and exaggerations. Corporations may thereby not only communicate\nor mislead with words but also visuals and graphics. This\ninvolves the deceptive use of commercials, show robots but\nalso covers certifications invoking unjustified commitments.\nBesides, it is not only the communication that may mislead\nbut also what is omitted. Several omission types can be distinguished (see Table 4): complete omission of information,\nselective disclosure, incomplete comparisons, and information masking. In addition, AI itself may be used to mislead\nwhen imitating humans, presenting biased information, or\nobscuring responsibilities (Chesney & Citron, 2019; Wagner\n& Winkler, 2019; Yeung, 2019). This may involve deceptive corporate practices, such as strategically using property\nrights protection or function creep, when silently changing\nthe algorithmic use case with a software update (Noto La\nDiega, 2018; Yeung, 2019). The misleading communication gestures are often accompanied by symbolic and aspirational measures and corporate political actions (Roose,\n2019; Yeung et al., 2020). Machinewashing can represent a\nprofound nonmarket strategy involving the full-level lobbying spectrum directed at the government, civil society, and\nacademia (Bietti, 2020; Floridi, 2019; Ochigame, 2019; Ress\u00e9guier & Rodrigues, 2020). Consequently, machinewashing\npractices go further than greenwashing, concerning nonmarket actions, but share the crucial similarity that deceptive\nclaims and actions are subject to the audience\u2019s interpretation, resting \u201cin the eye of the beholder\u201d (Floridi, 2019; Lyon\n& Montgomery, 2015, p. 6).\n\nExamples and Manifestations\nGreenwashing\nGreenwashing examples and manifestations are diverse\nand may be located at the product or firm level as listed\nin Table 4. One may find misleading claims such as\n\n\fStressing a trivial ethical/ green aspect,\nwhereas remaining business practices go\nagainst ethical or environmental standards\n\nClaims that make the organization or its\nproducts look better than they are.

Seele, M. D. Schultz\n\u201cFacebook has invested in the TU Munich\n\u2013 funding an institute to train AI ethicists.\nSimilarly, until recently Google had engaged\nphilosophers Joanna Bryson and Luciano\nFloridi for an \u2018Ethics Panel,\u2019 however this was\nabruptly discontinued at the end of last week.\nHad it not been for this, Google would have\nhad direct access via Floridi, a member of\nHLEG AI, to the process by which this group\nwill develop the political and investment\nrecommendations for the European Union\nstarting this month\u201d (Metzinger, 2019)\n\neco-friendly, environmental-friendly, eco-safe, all-natural,\nnon-toxic, eco-conscious in product descriptions (see, e.g.,\nFuterra and Terrachoice greenwash criteria in Zanasi et al.,\n2017). Further, companies may use language and information that only an expert may understand or publish inaccurate, exaggerated, or meaningless claims (Greenpeace\nGreenwash Criteria, in Zanasi et al., 2017). Misleading\nvisuals or graphics manifest as green-, eco-, or social labels\nthat highlight that a product or service meets the respective standards of the label (Bowen, 2014). In this regard,\ngreenwashing occurs when such certificates are erroneously\nadopted for products and services, which actually do not\nmeet the certified standards.\nSimilarly, corporate communication may mislead by\nomission: presenting environmental product attributes as\nproactive achievements while missing to disclose that the\naction was a requirement to comply with existing regulations\n(Becker-Olsen & Potucek, 2013; Walter, 2010). Greenwashing can also manifest as symbolic action such as: \u201cefficient\nlight bulbs made in a factory which pollutes rivers\u201d (Futerra\nSustainability Communications, 2009, p. 5). Further, a green\ncorporate image may be publicly presented, while the corporation lobbies against the environmental legislation (Walter,\n2010).\n\n13\n\n*Applies specifically to machinewashing\n\nFunding of research that favors corporate\ninterests and helps to steer the academic\ndebate\n\n\u2013\n\nMachinewashing\n\n(b) Academic lobbying*\n\nType\n\nTable 4\u2002\u2009(continued)\n\nDescription\n\nGreenwashing Example\n\nMachinewashing Example\n\n1076\n\nAmong the most prominent expression of machinewashing\n(see Table 4) is the corporate adherence to ethical principles and values listed in guidelines or similar standards,\nwhich often communicate vague claims of explainable,\nhuman-friendly, sustainable, or trustworthy AI (Floridi,\n2019; Jobin et al., 2019; Umbrello and van de Poel 2020;\nYeung et al., 2020). Machinewashing also manifests as\ndeceptive vague, and inaccurate claims, such as the example of IBM's flagship AI shows: \u201cIBM Watson is helping\ndoctors outthink cancer, one patient at a time\u201d (Brown,\n2017). Further, machinewashing may hide in the technical or legal jargon of lengthy data and privacy policies\nand service terms, which do not resonate with average\nconsumers (Obar & Oeldorf-Hirsch, 2020). Corporations\nalso mislead with visuals and graphics, as the show robot\nSophia exemplifies: \u201cSophia is not the first show robot to\nattain celebrity status. Yet accusations of hype and deception have proliferated about the misrepresentation of AI to\npublic and policymakers alike\u201d (Sharkey, 2018). Similar\nto eco-labels, an increasing number of initiatives aim to\nintroduce AI certification schemes, which run the same\nrisk as the aforementioned, in case of the absence of adequate control (AI Ethics Impact Group, 2020; IEEE Standards Association, 2020). Misleading behavior may also\ninvolve AI itself, such as providing biased real-time information: \u201cthere is a considerable risk that users misinterpret\n\n\f1077\n\nFrom Greenwashing to Machinewashing: A Model and Future Directions Derived from Reasoning\u2026\n\nthe data provided to them and make bad decisions based\non false or at best misleading information\u201d (Wagner &\nWinkler, 2019, p. 7). Or by using misleading claims about\npatent protection to leave AI code undisclosed and avoid\nexternal assessment: \u201cFirst, the overlap between, if not\nabuse of, intellectual property rights create a legal black\nbox which is very difficult to open \u201c (Noto La Diega, 2018,\np. 15).\nFurther, symbolic actions involving corporate ethics\nboards, in-house philosophers, ethics working groups, and\nmulti-stakeholder partnerships are prominent examples often\nassociated with machinewashing. Particularly when these\nactions fail to produce meaningful results, as in the case of\nthe instrumentalization of ethics to achieve organizational\noutcomes (Bietti, 2020; McMillan & Brown, 2019; Papazoglou, 2019). Another noteworthy expression of machinewashing is (covert) lobbying. Whereas legislative and judicial lobbying are well-known practices, lobbying academia\nto favor corporate interests is relatively new (Bietti, 2020;\nRess\u00e9guier & Rodrigues, 2020). Some have argued that the\ntechnology industry is manipulating academia to shape the\nAI debate by financing institutes that engage in AI ethics\nresearch (Ochigame, 2019; Ochigame et al., 2019). A recent\nNew York Times article shows that this strategy focuses not\nonly on soft-law research but also on hard-law and practicesoriented training directed at antitrust regulators and judges\nfrom multiple nations around the globe (Wakabayashi,\n2020). As shown by Hagendorff and Meding (2020), such\nacademic-industry cooperation is growing, with conflicts of\ninterest remaining often undisclosed (see, e.g., Wright et al.,\n2018).\n\nOutcomes\nGreenwashing\nCorporations engage in greenwashing practices to create a\npro-social or pro-environmental image that may lead to reputational gains (Laufer, 2003; Marciniak, 2010). A favorable impression can also distract from an unsustainable core\nbusiness (Marquis et al., 2016). In addition, several studies\nhighlight the role of consumer behavior, particularly in light\nof perceived corporate greenwashing and the willingness to\npay more for environmentally friendly products (Laroche\net al., 2001; Nyilasy et al., 2014; Szabo & Webster, 2020).\nAnother potential outcome of greenwashing is the potential\nfinancial gain and access to capital (Delmas & Burbano,\n2011; Du, 2014). Past literature shows that firms are also\nexposed to risk in light of external stakeholders' backslash for greenwashing (Szabo & Webster, 2020). Further,\nresearch has shown that retaining human capital can be an\n\nimportant outcome (Ramdhony, 2018). Ambiguity and aspirational talk about CSR may benefit employee engagement,\ntalent retention, and attraction, impacting firm capabilities\nand operational efficiency (Winkler et al., 2020).\n\nMachinewashing\nMachinewashing uses or misuses ethics to engineer or fabricate a public image or fa\u00e7ade that boosts the organizational\nreputation to appease and gain the acceptance of the public\nand critical stakeholders (Floridi, 2019; Johnson, 2019).\nMachinewashing may also create unintended network effects\nwhen misleading information is automatically distributed\nat scale and real time (Wagner & Winkler, 2019). In this\nway, machinewashing may also impact customer choice of\nproducts and company loyalty but also help to distract and\n\u201cretrofit some pre-existing behaviours (choices, processes,\nstrategies, etc.)\u201d (Floridi, 2019, p. 186). Further, machinewashing may shape AI's future development, given the\nunderlying goal to prevent, avoid, counter, delay, revise or\nreplace legislative efforts as a way to manage environmental\nrisks (Floridi, 2019; Ress\u00e9guier & Rodrigues, 2020). From\nan internal perspective, machinewashing may also relate\nto financial performance and impact the firm capabilities\n(McLennan et al., 2020; Rakova et al., 2020). A noteworthy\nexample was Google dropping its AI ethics council after\nemployee protests (Levin, 2019). The example also shows\nthe potential impact of machinewashing on organizational\nidentification, employee engagement, and an employer's\nattractiveness. Additionally, unintended outcomes may be\ntriggered, such as increased job polarization, where promises\nof AI may manifest for high-skill workers but leave middleskilled workers worse off (Dau-Schmidt, 2018; Huang &\nRust, 2021b).\n\nFrom the Structural Analogy Towards\na Definition of Machinewashing\nIn the sections above, we reasoned by analogy to structurally map the machinewashing phenomenon and delineate\nits unique conceptual boundaries in a new model (Gentner\n& Smith, 2012; Ketokivi et al., 2017; Nersessian, 2008;\nVaughan, 2014). Given the novelty of the phenomenon, few\nattempts have been made to provide a conceptual definition of machinewashing (see Table 2). Yet, a scientific concept definition may help to better understand the diverse\nmachinewashing practices and trigger a focused research\nprogram (Nersessian, 2008). Thus, a definition can assist\nfuture attempts to operationalize and engage in the empirical study. This is crucial when it comes to identifying and\nmeasuring machinewashing and its outcomes. Further, from\na practical perspective, a conceptual definition can assist\n\n13\n\n\f1078\n\ncorporations in avoiding misleading about their AI ethics\nactivities. Consequently, we believe there is a need for a\ncomprehensive theory-informed machinewashing definition.\nTherefore, the following definition derives from the structural analogy and the idiosyncrasies of the outlined machinewashing model (Ketokivi et al., 2017; Nersessian, 2008).\nDefinition: machinewashing is defined as a strategy that\norganizations adopt to engage in misleading behavior (communication and/or action) about ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) / algorithmic systems. Machinewashing involves\nmisleading information about ethical AI communicated or\nomitted via words, visuals, or the underlying algorithm of\nAI itself. Furthermore, and going beyond greenwashing,\nmachinewashing may be used for symbolic actions such as\n(covert) lobbying and prevention of stricter regulation.\n\nThe Analogy as Foundation for Future\nMachinewashing Research\nMachinewashing as a novel and multifaceted phenomenon\nrequires the close attention of practitioners, regulators, and\nthe broader public, making it a highly interesting and timely\nsubject of study for business ethics and related fields (Bietti,\n2020; Johnson, 2015; Martin et al., 2019). Given the relevance and strength of the link between the greenwashing and\nmachinewashing domains established above, we argue that\nthe analogy-derived machinewashing model can constitute\nthe basis for future research to study the diverse machinewashing practices (Fig. 1; Table 4). Thus, in the following,\nwe provide evidence of the structural soundness and factual\nvalidity of the analogy by demonstrating how machinewashing: (1) links to existing theories underpinning the greenwashing debate, and (2) lends itself to multiple research\nquestions for empirical study (Ketokivi et al., 2017). The\nbelow-described theories are grouped according to macro,\nmeso, and micro levels, indicating the respective focus of the\ntheories (Cornelissen & Durand, 2014; Jeurissen, 1997). In\nlight of Alvesson and Sandberg\u2019s (2013) problematization\nstrategy, we emphasize the need to challenge the suggested\ntheories concerning their underlying core assumptions and\nthe distinct characteristics of machinewashing (see Idiosyncrasies of Machinewashing). Consequently, the proposed\ntheories should not be seen as an exhaustive list but as an\ninitial starting point to expand the analogy and broaden the\nscope of the machinewashing research (Table 5).\n\nMacro\u2011level Theories\nFuture machinewashing research may focus on macro\ntheories dealing with organizations and the broader environments they are embedded in. This includes studying\n\n13\n\nP. Seele, M. D. Schultz\n\nmachinewashing concerning macro-level institutions, such\nas markets and governments, and more general cultural traditions of a given context (Cornelissen & Durand, 2014;\nJeurissen, 1997). To adapt and shape this institutional environment, organizations may adopt machinewashing practices\n(Scott, 2014). In this regard, the following macro-level theories offer fruitful avenues to shed light on machinewashing\npractices: legitimacy theory, corporate political activity, and\nresource-dependence theory.\nLegitimacy refers to the extent to which an organization\noperates according to a given set of social rules, such as\nformal and informal ones (Long & Driscoll, 2008; Suchman, 1995; Suddaby et al., 2017). Legitimacy theory follows the idea that organizations strive for social approval\nof their conduct in a given setting while avoiding disapproval to ensure their business continuity. Thus, to maintain\nwhat has been termed \u201csocial license to operate,\u201d organizations engage in a constant legitimization process (Mel\u00e9 &\nArmengou, 2016). Legitimacy theory can help shed light\non machinewashing practices that aim at various types of\nlegitimacy\u2014pragmatic, moral, and cognitive (Bietti, 2020;\nGreenwood et al., 2011). For instance, previous research\nassociates greenwashing with an organization\u2019s failure to\nattain pragmatic legitimacy (Seele & Gatti, 2017). Analog,\nthis raises the question: how does machinewashing relate to\ndifferent types of legitimacy\u2014pragmatic, moral, and cognitive (Long & Driscoll, 2008)? Previous legitimacy research\nalso associates corporate ethics codes with strategic selfinterest, which may lead to symbolic isomorphism (Long &\nDriscoll, 2008). Similarly, today\u2019s AI ethics codes may serve\nthe organizational self-interest and gradually converge, such\nthat a hypocritical approach to ethics may become the new\nsocial norm in the institutional context (Jobin et al., 2019;\nLong & Driscoll, 2008). Thus, legitimacy theory can also\nilluminate mimetic pressure from the institutional environment regarding how mimetic pressure in the market might\naffect a firm\u2019s use of machinewashing. This also raises the\nquestion: which kind of pressure (mimetic or normative)\nis more influential in adopting machinewashing practices?\nFuture research may also benefit from the theoretical\ninsights of corporate political activity (CPA) research,\nincluding lobbying and public affairs. As shown above,\nmachinewashing is strongly associated with legislative,\njudicial, and academic lobbying (Bietti, 2020; Floridi,\n2019; Ochigame, 2019; Ress\u00e9guier & Rodrigues, 2020).\nHere, the CPA and public affairs lenses may help study\nmachinewashing practices of organizations that are actively\nshaping their institutional environments. As discussed by\nden Hond et al.

However, organizations risk being exposed (machinewashing) as\nplayers on both chessboards, which may adversely impact\ntheir reputation and legitimacy if these two strategies are not\naligned (den Hond et al., 2014; Rehbein et al., 2018). Interesting future research questions may revolve around the conceptual framing of two chessboards' logic, including institutionalization and paradoxes resulting from misalignment.\nQuestions may include: Does machinewashing distract society from questioning the limits of current AI ethics programs\nand from pushing governments to adopt stricter regulations?\nHow are lobbying expenditures against more stringent AI\nregulations related to organizational spending on AI ethics\nprograms (Zuboff, 2021)? Which role do societal watchdogs\nor internal whistleblowers play in exposing a misalignment\nof the two chessboards? In addition, the CPA theory lens is\nbeneficial in investigating the rising academic lobbying: to\nwhat extent does organizational funding of public research\nfavor corporate interests? Does the lobbying of academic\ninstitutions undermine the independence of academia?\nResource-dependence theory (RDT) argues that firms'\nlong-term survival and growth hinges on access to critical resources. Future research may build on this theoretical angle when studying machinewashing as a nonmarket\norganizational strategy used to \u201creduce environmental\ninterdependence and uncertainty\u201d (Hillman et al., 2009, p.\n1404). Here, AI ethics and other related firm activities can\nbe observed as mechanisms to reduce external dependence\nfor critical resources and create a favorable non-market environment to secure essential resources from external stakeholders (Mellahi et al., 2016; Shirodkar et al., 2018). From\nthis perspective, the flow of digital (behavioral) data may\nbe perceived as a crucial resource that machinewashing\npractices help to secure (Zuboff, 2019). Thus, interesting\nquestions may relate to how resource pressure impacts the\nadoption and use of machinewashing? How is AI used as a\nresource itself to engage in machinewashing and influence\nexternal stakeholders? Previous research also highlights the\nvalue of RDT when understanding boards (Hillman et al.,\n2009). In particular, RDT may help to shed light on the way\nin which organizations may use AI ethics boards to limit\ndependence or gain certain resources, as the case of Google\u2019s ethics panel composition has shown (Metzinger, 2019).\n\nMeso\u2011level Theories\nOrganizational-focused theories can be utilized to better\nunderstand organizational antecedents and outcomes of\nmachinewashing. Thus, organizational-focused theories are\non an intermediate level between macro and micro-theories,\n\n13\n\n\f1082\n\nopening the door to a better understanding of internal conditions under which organizations engage in machinewashing practices (Cornelissen & Durand, 2014). In this regard,\nfuture research may draw on insights from organizational\ninstitutionalism, instrumental/deliberative CSR, and signaling theory.\nOrganizational institutionalism. A fruitful avenue of\nfuture research is the decoupling concept as discussed in\norganizational institutionalism (Greenwood et al., 2018).\nDecoupling focuses on the potential gap between firms\u2019 policies and practices or, more precisely, means and ends (Bromley & Powell, 2012). Decoupling is relevant for machinewashing research, particularly to observe formal AI policies\nadopted by technology corporations concerning their daily\nbusiness conduct. CSR and greenwashing research highlight\nthe need to study talk action dynamics and, in light of aspirational CSR talk (Christensen et al., 2020a, 2020b; Glozer\n& Morsing, 2020). Firms\u2019 resources dedicated to ethical AI\nmay have limited or no relation to their intended AI goals.\nThus, research questions along these lines include to what\nextent are organization AI ethics principles aligned with dayto-day practices? How do internal procedures and the goal to\npreserve organizational efficiency relate to the adoption of\nmachinewashing practices? What role can ethics boards play\nin ensuring that ethics guidelines and codes are translated to\ndaily practice? Another interesting question to explore is to\nwhat extent are specific machinewashing practices (already)\ninstitutionalized within a given organization?\nInstrumental and deliberative CSR. Communication\nabout ethical AI is often labeled as untrustworthy, aspirational, and not least as machinewashing (Benkler, 2019; B.\nMittelstadt, 2019; Truby, 2020). Similar concerns have previously been raised about CSR as a mere marketing or public\nrelations tool, where a substantial gap between symbolic and\naspirational managerial \u2018talk\u2019 and the actual upholding of\nsocial responsibility standards prevails (Christensen et al.,\n2017; Haack et al., 2012; Winkler et al., 2020). In response\nto such critique, recent research observes how communication can move from an instrumental to a deliberative mode\n(B. D. Mittelstadt et al., 2015; Palazzo & Scherer, 2006;\nScholz et al., 2019; Winkler et al., 2020). Seele and Lock\n(2015) outline a pathway about how idealistic principles can\nbe translated into practice via discourse ideals. Further, Winkler et al. (2020) develop a framework of agnostic rhetoric\nthat may facilitate the enactment of aspirational talk. In a\nsimilar vein, Christensen et al. (2017) emphasize a license\nto critique, outlining that ongoing communication (involving criticism and contestation) about sustainability standards\nis necessary to develop, adjust, and fine-tune standards as\nfunctional governance tools. Consequently, such deliberative\napproaches may also represent fruitful avenues for future\nmachinewashing research, triggering important questions:\nCan a deliberative approach to AI ethics offset the lack of\n\n13\n\nP. Seele, M. D. Schultz\n\nsocietal watchdogs and assist in transferring principles into\npractice? Who controls the current AI ethics discourse, and\nwhy? How are power and information asymmetries in the\nAI ethics discourse related to machinewashing practices?\nHow can symbolic practices (e.g., ethics working groups and\nmulti-stakeholder partnerships) be turned into meaningful\nand constructive discussions on ethical AI?\nSignaling theory focuses on the behavior of a sender (e.g.,\na corporation) and a receiver (e.g., the customers, the public)\nin a communication process that is characterized by diverging information access (Connelly et al., 2011). Thus, signaling theory leans towards micro-levels, dealing with how the\norganization \u201csignals\u201d information to receivers, who choose\nthe way of interpreting the communicated signal (Connelly\net al., 2011). In greenwashing literature, the disclosure of\ncorporate signals is studied as a form of deliberative communication of positive information that lacks observable\nattributes (Bowen, 2014). From this perspective, the corporate engagement in symbolic practices of \u2018ethical talk\u2019\nabout AI can be an effective signal toward society, underlining the corporate commitment to ethical values (Walker\n& Wan, 2012; Wu et al., 2020). In this regard, signaling\ntheory stresses that corporations might signal false claims\n\u201cif initial financial payoffs outweigh future losses once\nthe truth becomes known\u201d (Whelan & Demangeot, 2015,\np. 1). Thus, signaling theory opens the door for observing\nmachinewashing from an economic self-interest perspective and instrumental rationale. Analogous to greenwashing\nresearch, one may ask whether machinewashing pays off for\nan organization (Berrone et al., 2017)? Is machinewashing\nused to change perceptions about organizational AI ethics\nperformance? Does evidence exist that the market values\nmachinewashing (Du, 2014)? Does greater transparency\nabout AI ethics programs, such as the disclosure of algorithmic code, mitigate information asymmetries between\norganizations and their stakeholders?\n\nMicro\u2011level Theories\nWhereas the previous paragraphs outline machinewashing\nissues connected to organizations and the environments in\nwhich they are embedded, the study of machinewashing on\na micro-level is likewise important (Lyon & Montgomery,\n2015). Micro-level theories focus on the individual within\nand around organizations (Cornelissen & Durand, 2014).\nMicro-level theories are essential, as machinewashing\npractices can influence or be shaped by prominent individuals within an organization. In addition, as a phenomenon\nthat lies in the beholder's eye, it is crucial to study how\nexternal stakeholders evaluate machinewashing. Thus, how\nindividuals perceive various machinewashing practices.\n\n\fFrom Greenwashing to Machinewashing: A Model and Future Directions Derived from Reasoning\u2026\n\nPrevious greenwashing research builds on two prominent\ntheories in this regard: agency and attribution theory.\nAgency theory may provide a fruitful avenue for future\nresearch to analyze internal antecedents of machinewashing. Individual actors may play a crucial role in designing,\nimplanting, and executing AI ethics programs. Managers\nmay engage in machinewashing activities and thereby follow personal interests (as opposed to shareholder interests), creating costs and inefficiencies for the principle (the\norganization) and broader society (Bosse & Phillips, 2016;\nHadani & Schuler, 2013; Petrenko et al., 2016). An interesting question in this regard is how do managers instrumentalize AI ethics or build on information asymmetries\nto pursue their own career goals? Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s\nFacebook role has recently received critical attention\n(Abdalla & Abdalla, 2020; Zuboff, 2021). Thus, agency\ntheory raises questions, such as: how does machinewashing impact agency cost? How can organizations control\nand verify that an agent acts in the principal's interest, not\nengaging in machinewashing practices? Further, it may be\ninteresting to apply agency theory regarding employee\u2019s\nrelation to machinewashing practices. The introductory\nexample of Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell may be\nan interesting starting point to study how machinewashing practices may impact organizational identification,\nemployee engagement, and performance (Johnson, 2021;\nVincent, 2021). Thus, further questions raised by agency\ntheory include: how do AI ethics programs relate to individual employees? What is the impact of machinewashing on employee performance, well-being, and satisfaction? How can individual members of the organization\nbe included in creating AI ethics codes and guidelines?\nHow can individuals (continuously) challenge and be challenged by the code of their respective organizations?\nAnother theory that may prove helpful for future research\nis attribution theory (Harvey et al., 2014; Lange & Washburn, 2012). Attribution theory may help to capture external\nevaluations of machinewashing on an individual basis. This\nmay include studying individuals' perceptions of machinewashing practices and the conclusions they draw from them.\nThus, important avenues for future research may consist of\nhow observers make sense of machinewashing communication and whether this may relate to aspects such as purchase and investment intention or product and organizational\nloyalty (Ginder et al., 2019; Pizzetti et al., 2019). In addition, attributional processes may help explain individuals\u2019\nemotions and behavior when facing potential deceptive AI\nclaims. This raises several questions: What micro-level\nattribution processes occur when consumers perceive AI\nethics programs to be misleading? How do consumers and\nthe wider public perceive deceptive practices, such as using\nintellectual property rights law to avoid disclosing algorithmic code or obscuring responsibility for unintended\n\n1083\n\noutcomes of semi-automated systems by blaming the human\nin the loop?\n\nEmpirical Inquiry\nTo further explore and theorize about machinewashing\nempirical inquiry is paramount, as current research remains\nlargely conceptual (Benkler, 2019; Jobin et al., 2019; Wagner, 2018). As shown above, future research may utilize the\ntheories from the three focus levels as a basis for empirical\nstudy. The suggested research questions (see Table 5) can\nbe seen as initial ideas to apply these theories to different\norganizations, different organizational and institutional contexts, and investigate individual behavior. The complexity of\nmachinewashing practices demands a holistic way of proceeding that draws on different methodological approaches,\nsuch as quantitative, qualitative, and combined methods.\nFurther, to gain profound insights into machinewashing, it\nis necessary to collect data on multiple levels (individuals,\norganizations, and aggregated institutional contexts) and\nstudy processes and how they develop over time. The introductory case of Timnit Gebru exemplifies the involvement of\nmultiple levels (from individual to aggregated institutions)\nand the need to study machinewashing practices from within\nand outside the organization and how it unfolds over time\n(Johnson, 2021; Vincent, 2021).\nFuture research may also benefit from further operationalizing the outlined machinewashing concept. This may\ninclude developing ways to measure stakeholder perceptions\nof machinewashing as a phenomenon that lies in the eye of\nthe beholder (Lyon & Montgomery, 2015). In this regard,\none possible pathway for future research is developing a\nscale that allows assessing perceptions of machinewashing.\nScale development is a multistage process that helps create\na validated scientific measurement instrument (DeVellis,\n2017; Hinkin, 1995; Jian et al., 2014). In addition, scales can\nreveal insights into variables such as machinewashing that\nare not readily observable (DeVellis, 2017). Thus, a scale\ncan benefit future research to generate and test hypotheses\nempirically, such as the perceived legitimacy of corporate\nAI soft policies.\n\nConclusion\nWith the widespread implementation of AI, organizations\nhave started implementing AI ethics programs to meet societal and regulatory concerns and counter potential adverse\noutcomes of AI. However, critical voices increasingly question the reality behind corporate AI ethics, labeling it as\nmachinewashing (Johnson, 2021; Ochigame, 2019). This\narticle set out to offer conceptual clarity into the emerging\n\n13\n\n\f1084\n\nmachinewashing debate, discussing its resemblance and\ndifference to greenwashing and providing a research program based on multiple theory lenses present in existing\ngreenwashing literature. We have reasoned by analogy,\ninvoking as structural mapping of greenwashing as the\nsource and machinewashing as the target domain to allow\nfor a knowledge transfer, thus, creating a theory-informed\nmodel of machinewashing (Ketokivi et al., 2017; Nersessian,\n2008). Given the distinct idiosyncrasies of machinewashing, we have cautioned against a blind transfer of theoretical\nassumptions from greenwashing to machinewashing (Alvesson & Sandberg, 2013). Thus, we have emphasized the need\nfor adaptations and critical reflection about greenwashing\ntheories against distinct machinewashing characteristics.\nFurther, we strongly encourage future research to draw on\ntheoretical insights beyond the previously mentioned theories to allow for a rethinking and the generation of novel\ninsights beyond the traditional \u201cresearch box\u201d or community\n(Alvesson & Sandberg, 2014). Overall, with our conceptual\nmachinewashing model, the definition, and the theory-driven\nresearch program, we strive to trigger future research and\ncross-disciplinary dialog about machinewashing.\n\nLimitations and Future Research\nThe introduction of the greenwashing-machinewashing\nanalogy can enhance the understanding of organizational\nmachinewashing practices and benefit theorizing in the\nemerging domain. However, researchers and theorists should\nnot simply accept the analogy for its own sake. Therefore,\nan important future research direction is to critique the analogy, particularly in its boundary conditions (Ketokivi et al.,\n2017). In this regard, the section on machinewashing idiosyncrasies has shown where limitations of the analogy are\nsituated, which in turn, can lead to novel insights. Thus,\nit is necessary to map and collect further evidence about\nthe boundaries of the analogy to ensure the progress of the\noutlined research program. Another important starting point\nfor future research to extend the themes highlighted in this\nmanuscript relates to the broader discussion of whether AI\nsystems or environmental issues go along with more systematic and universal impacts. For example, AI systems,\nwith their possibility to automate work, decision making,\nidea production, value creation, organizational structures,\nand reward systems, increasingly disrupt the job market and\nfirms' management processes (Chalmers et al., 2020; Lyytinen et al., 2017). This may trigger broader societal debates\nabout aspects, such as the tension between increased automation and the possibility to uphold high employment rates.\nFuture research may pay attention to such macro discussions in the CSR domain, where social and environmental\nissues are discussed concerning systemic perspectives on\n\n13\n\nP. Seele, M. D. Schultz\n\noverconsumption and closed-loop economies (Kopnina,\n2019; Murray et al., 2017).\n\nPractical Implications\nMachinewashing practices are difficult to assess, representing high credence issues similar to greenwashing. Over the\npast decades, new governance mechanisms and objective\nassessment methods emerged to approach challenges related\nto greenwashing and connected social and environmental\nproblems (Beder, 2002; Lim & Phillips, 2008). With these\napproaches, regulators and NGOs are empowered to independently assess product and firm-level greenwashing by\nverifying product components or auditing work sites (Delmas & Burbano, 2011; see, e.g., Federal Trade Commission\n(FTC) 2012; TerraChoice, 2010). Regarding machinewashing, an objective external assessment is highly difficult or\neven impossible to perform without a firms\u2019 collaboration\nto share the algorithmic code or accept algorithmic auditing\n(Buhmann et al., 2020; Yeung, 2019). Thus, it remains a crucial challenge from a practical perspective to gain insights\ninto and assess algorithmic black boxes (Martin, 2019). Theoretically, several solutions may be possible to tackle this\nchallenge, ranging from voluntary transparency to complete\ndisclosure requirements. Corporations may opt to transparently share the code of their algorithms with the public.\nHowever, in light of current market practices and corporate interests to protect business models and value chains,\nsuch an approach seems unlikely (Noto La Diega, 2018).\nA more feasible solution could be a state-level assessment\nbody for algorithms, such as in the case of high-risk AI and\nthe multistage certification process in the aviation industry\n(European Aviation Safety Agency, 2020) or an independent third-party verification performed by an auditing firm\nor delegated regulation unit as in co-regulation (Kamara,\n2017). Above all, governments could implement new regulations for mandatory disclosure about algorithms and the\nhandling of user data, similar to the transparency provided\nby soft- and hard-law approaches (Gatti et al., 2019) that aim\nat countering greenwashing.\nFunding Open access funding provided by Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera\nitaliana.\n\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of\ninterest.\nEthical Approval This article does not contain any studies with human\nparticipants performed by any of the authors.\n\n\fFrom Greenwashing to Machinewashing: A Model and Future Directions Derived from Reasoning\u2026\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long\nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source,\nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes\nwere made.

The current research investigates which types of consumers\nhave greater AI receptivity. Contrary to expectations revealed in four surveys, cross country data\nand six additional studies find that people with lower AI literacy are typically more receptive to\nAI. This lower literacy-greater receptivity link is not explained by differences in perceptions of\nAI\u2019s capability, ethicality, or feared impact on humanity. Instead, this link occurs because people\n\ne\nPe\n\nwith lower AI literacy are more likely to perceive AI as magical and experience feelings of awe\nin the face of AI\u2019s execution of tasks that seem to require uniquely human attributes. In line with\n\nrR\n\nthis theorizing, the lower literacy-higher receptivity link is mediated by perceptions of AI as\n\nev\n\nmagical and is moderated among tasks not assumed to require distinctly human attributes. These\n\niew\n\nfindings suggest that companies may benefit from shifting their marketing efforts and product\ndevelopment towards consumers with lower AI literacy. Additionally, efforts to demystify AI\nmay inadvertently reduce its appeal, indicating that maintaining an aura of magic around AI\ncould be beneficial for adoption.\n\non\n\nrsi\n\nVe\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nKeywords: artificial intelligence, algorithms, AI literacy, AI adoption, technology,\nhuman-computer interaction, awe\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 3 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n3\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) systems\u2013automated systems so advanced that they can mimic\nor outperform human cognition\u2014are radically transforming our society. Companies operating in\nthe private and public sectors have been rapidly adopting AI systems due to the competitive\nadvantages and operational efficiencies they offer (Brynjolfsson et al. 2023). Indeed, global\ninvestments in AI have grown substantially in the last decade, a trend that is forecasted to\ncontinue (Maslej et al. 2023). Most recently, generative AI\u2014AI systems capable of\nautonomously generating textual, visual, or auditory data\u2014has reached the public at large with\n\ne\nPe\n\nthe release in 2022 of text-to-image models like DALL-E, text-to-video systems like Make-AVideo, and chatbots like ChatGPT. Thus, consumers are coming across AI-driven products and\n\nrR\n\nservices in nearly every aspect of their personal, social, and professional life, from digital\n\nev\n\npersonal assistants, recommendation agents on social media, and customer service chatbots.\n\niew\n\nDue to the many potential benefits of AI to consumers, companies, and society at large\n(Brynjolfsson et al., 2023; Herman, Yalcin, and Puntoni 2024), substantial research has\nexamined the determinants of consumer\u2019s receptivity towards AI\u2014consumers\u2019 proclivity\n\nVe\n\ntowards AI usage. This research has typically focused on situational factors associated with\n\nrsi\n\nreceptivity to AI (e.g., Castelo, Bos and Lehman 2019; Valenzuela et al. 2024). However,\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nmarketers must also understand which consumers are more likely to adopt their AI products for\noptimal targeting and product development. Much less is known about how systematic\ndifferences across consumers\u2014i.e., individual-level factors\u2014predict AI receptivity, which is the\nfocus of the present research.\nMore specifically, in the current work we explore the relationship between consumers\u2019 AI\nliteracy (i.e., their objective knowledge about AI) and their AI receptivity (i.e., proclivity towards\nAI usage). Though most people forecast that consumers with greater AI literacy are more\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 4 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\nreceptive to AI, we theorize and demonstrate that it is those with lower AI literacy who exhibit\ngreater AI receptivity\u2014 a relationship we refer to as the lower literacy-higher receptivity link.\nThe lower literacy-higher receptivity link occurs because AI systems are executing tasks\nthat were once thought to require uniquely human traits, such as feeling emotions, having a\npersonality, holding beliefs (see Santoro and Monin 2023). Whereas people with higher AI\nliteracy recognize that AI can execute such tasks without actually having distinctly human\nattributes, people with lower AI literacy perceive AI\u2019s execution of such tasks as more magical\n\ne\nPe\n\nand experience greater feelings of awe when thinking about AI executing such tasks. In turn,\nperceptions of AI as magical and ensuing feelings of awe explain the lower literacy-higher\n\nrR\n\nreceptivity link. Thus, when AI executes tasks that are not associated with distinctly human\n\nev\n\nattributes\u2014tasks less likely to evoke perceptions of AI as magical and feelings of awe\u2014the\n\niew\n\nrelationship between AI literacy and receptivity is moderated. Additionally, we find that people\nwith higher AI literacy generally perceive AI to be more capable, more ethical, have less fear of\nAI, and exhibit greater readiness to adopt technology in general than people with lower AI\n\nVe\n\nliteracy. Thus, people with lower literacy exhibit greater AI receptivity despite rather than\nbecause of these alternative explanations.\n\non\n\nrsi\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nTheoretically, our research identifies AI literacy as an important yet overlooked\nindividual-level predictor of AI receptivity. In explaining the lower literacy-higher receptivity\nlink, we present a theory of AI receptivity based on perceptions of AI as magical and ensuing\nfeelings of awe that can help reconcile conflicting findings on consumer responses to new\ntechnologies. Practically, our research suggests that marketing managers\u2019 inclinations towards\ntargeting consumers with higher AI literacy for AI-based products and services may be\nmisguided. Instead, businesses may benefit from targeting those with lower AI literacy,\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n4\n\n\fPage 5 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n5\n\ndesigning products to meet the needs of this target segment, and tailoring their marketing\nmessages to highlight the perceived magicalness of AI solutions. This is particularly true for AI\nproducts and services designed to execute tasks perceived to require distinctly human attributes.\n\nTheoretical Development\n\nAI Receptivity\n\ne\nPe\n\nThe adoption of AI-based products and services by consumers plays a pivotal role in the\nsuccess and growth of businesses and society (Herman and Puntoni 2024). AI-based products\n\nrR\n\nand services can address complex challenges and provide solutions that may not be achievable\n\nev\n\nthrough traditional methods alone. For instance, in healthcare, AI applications can assist in early\n\niew\n\ndisease detection, improve diagnostic accuracy, and support treatment decisions (Topol 2019),\nand in finance, AI tools have the potential to increase financial inclusion (e.g., Wang et al. 2019).\nReaping the benefits of AI critically depends on AI receptivity, which we define as\n\nVe\n\nconsumers\u2019 proclivity towards AI usage. This includes an individual\u2019s openness, readiness,\n\nrsi\n\nand/or likelihood of integrating AI into their own lives and to have AI integrated into the world\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\naround them. Substantial conceptual and empirical research has indeed explored the determinants\nof people\u2019s receptivity towards AI. This research has highlighted the situational factors related to\nvariability in AI receptivity: how characteristics of the task, such as subjectivity versus\nobjectivity, salient consumer goals, such as hedonic versus utilitarian considerations, and\nattributes of the AI agent, such as performance, actual and perceived capabilities, and social\ndistance, affect consumers\u2019 responses to AI (Castelo, Bos and Lehman 2019; de Bellis, Johar and\nPoletti 2023; Longoni and Cian 2022; Yalcin et al. 2022; for reviews, see Puntoni et al. 2021;\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 6 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n6\n\nValenzuela et al. 2024).\n\nIn contrast, seemingly little research focuses on individual factors that systematically\npredict receptivity towards AI, (for an exception, Liu, Kirshner and Lim 2023). It is important to\nconsider how individual-level differences across consumers might impact receptivity towards AI\nusage to better understand to the optimality of targeting different marketing segments, to\nappreciate and evaluate the implications of policy recommendations, and to optimize the design\nof AI-applications. Yet, individual-level factors have been largely neglected by empirical AI\n\ne\nPe\n\nresearch. One important yet overlooked factor that may impact AI receptivity, and is the focus on\nthe present research, is consumers\u2019 degree of knowledge about AI\u2014their AI literacy.\nAI literacy\n\nev\n\nrR\n\nBy AI literacy we refer to a person\u2019s objective knowledge about AI including conceptual\n\niew\n\nand technical knowledge, best practices in AI development and usage, as well as regulatory\nrequirements. At the moment, it is unclear how AI literacy might impact consumers\u2019 receptivity\ntowards AI, in part due to lack of appropriate measurement of AI literacy. Academic work has\n\nVe\n\noften conflated AI knowledge with opinions about how algorithms operate in specific settings\n\nrsi\n\nlike Facebook News Feed and TikTok (e.g., Rader and Gray 2015; Siles, Valerio-Alfaro, and\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nMel\u00e9ndez-Moran 2022), or measured knowledge in terms of self-reported assessment of\ncompetency. Indeed, existing measures of AI knowledge tend to capture whether people believe\nthey have the necessary technical skills to use technologies, and whether they believe they know\na lot about technologies (e.g., Kabakus, Bahcekapili, and Ayez 2023) rather than people\u2019s\nobjective AI knowledge. Even when AI knowledge has been assessed more directly and\nobjectively, research has not directly connected such knowledge to consumers\u2019 receptivity\ntowards AI (e.g., Dogruel, Masur, and Joeckel 2022; Latzer, Festic, and Kappeler 2021;\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 7 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n7\n\nZarouali, Boerman, and Vreese 2021). Finally, methodologically, research exploring consumers\u2019\nknowledge about algorithms has been predominantly conceptual or qualitative, relying on openended protocols, interviews, and opinion surveys (e.g., Cotter and Reisdorf 2020; Hargittai et al.\n2020). In contrast to beliefs, opinions, and subjective perceptions about AI, in the current\nresearch we develop and employ objective, quantitative measures of AI literacy to examine its\nrelationship with receptivity towards AI-based products and services.\nAI Literacy and AI Receptivity: Competing Predictions\n\ne\nPe\n\nThere are competing predictions with respect to the relationship between AI literacy and\nAI receptivity. Perhaps the most straightforward prediction is that higher levels of AI literacy are\n\nrR\n\nassociated with greater receptivity towards AI-based products and services. For example,\n\nev\n\nresearch shows that consumers are less dissatisfied with being denied services by an algorithm if\n\niew\n\nthey are provided an explanation of what the overarching goal or objective of the algorithm was\n(Tomaino et al. 2022). This finding insinuates that people\u2019s lack of knowledge about how AI\nworks makes them more cynical towards AI making decisions. In line with this idea, some\n\nVe\n\nresearchers have explicitly advocated for greater education about technology to increasing its\n\nrsi\n\nadoption (e.g., Richter and Sinha 2020). Such assertions further imply that AI literacy is\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\npositively associated with greater receptivity towards utilizing AI-based products and services.\nMost people appear to share the intuition that people with more knowledge about AI will\nbe more receptive towards it. Indeed, in four surveys among consumers from different\npopulations\u2014Twitter users, LinkedIn users, business undergraduate students, and an online\nsample\u2014we asked people to predict whether people with more (vs. less) AI literacy would want\nto use AI more, use AI less, or there would be no relationship with AI usage. Across all four\nsamples, people believed that greater AI literacy would be associated with greater propensity to\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 8 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n8\n\nuse it. The results of these polls are reported in Table 1. Additionally, we surveyed a group of 36\ntop line executives at a major European insurance company and asked them which customer\nsegment they would be more likely to target for AI-based products in development. All 36\nexecutives indicated that they would target consumers with higher (vs. lower) AI literacy. In\nsum, current wisdom favors the prediction that people with higher AI literacy are more receptive\nto AI.\nTable 1- People\u2019s forecasts about the relationship between AI literacy and AI receptivity.\nWant to use AI more\n\nWant to use AI less\n\nNo relationship\n\n66.7%a\n\n19.0%b\n\n14.3%b\n\n73.0%a\n\n10.0%b\n\n17.0%b\n\n73.7%a\n\n13.2%b\n\n13.2%b\n\n63.8% a\n\n17.3% b\n\n18.9% b\n\niew\n\nev\n\nrR\n\nPoll Setting\nTwitter\n(63 responses)\nLinkedIn\n(30 responses)\nBusiness\nundergraduates\n(38 responses)\nOnline sample\n(301 responses)\n\ne\nPe\n\nNotes: The question asked was: \u201cDo you think that people with more (vs. less) knowledge of AI and algorithms: (a)\nWant to use AI more, (b) Want to use AI less, (c) No relationship.

These \u201cintelligent machines\u201d can operate in ways that\nresemble human cognition, executing tasks and making decisions that are typically linked to\ndistinctly human attributes such as having a personality or holding beliefs. AI's ability to execute\ntasks once thought to be exclusively carried out by humans, such as producing speech, creating a\nmovie or playing an instrument, can seem to transcend the boundaries of conventional\ntechnology. Of course, AI systems do not actually need to possess human attributes to perform\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 9 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n9\n\nthese tasks. For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate seemingly empathetic\nresponses without experiencing empathy themselves. This can create an illusory perception that\nAI has human attributes when it executes these tasks. Indeed, interviews with teachers of\nmachine learning found that students often readily attribute human qualities to such technology\n(Sulmont, Patitsas, & Cooperstock, 2019). This misattribution of human attributes to AI systems\nis related to the concept of anthropomorphism in technology. As discussed by Epley et al.\n(2007), people tend to ascribe human characteristics to non-human agents, especially when these\n\ne\nPe\n\nagents exhibit behavior that resembles human actions. We suggest that AI executing tasks\npreviously believed to require distinctly human attributes and the resulting perceptions of AI as\n\nrR\n\nhaving humanlike attributes can result in people perceiving AI as magical.\n\nev\n\nIndeed, AI has been likened to a form of magic, in part due to the illusory manner in\n\niew\n\nwhich it can appear to have distinctly human attributes and even sentience (Sharkey and Sharkey\n2006). This assertion aligns with Arthur Clarke\u2019s third, and most well-known law, \u201cany\nsufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\u201d (Clark 1968, p. 255). The\n\nVe\n\nnotion of AI as magical further echoes with depictions of AI in the popular culture. AI is\n\nrsi\n\nfrequently portrayed in popular culture with an aura of mystery and power that exceeds human\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\ncomprehension, even surpassing the limits of human cognition. For example, in The Matrix, the\nAI that governs the virtual world is portrayed as having god-like control over reality, bending\nphysical laws in ways that seem magical. In fact, the premise that people readily think of AI as\nmagical can help explain terminology used in AI coding such as \u201cspellcasting\u201d which indicates\nthe provision of an input in a prompt to a language model, and the naming of AI tools like\nGoogle\u2019s AI Agent \u201cMagical,\u201d which provides AI-enabled autofill automation.\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 10 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n10\n\nWe suggest that, to the extent that AI is perceived as magical, it should elicit feelings of\nawe. Awe typically results from encountering something of such magnitude that the experience\nsurpasses their existing comprehension of the world (Keltner and Haidt 2003). Past research has\nconnected the experience of awe to adoption of virtual reality and virtual assistants\n(Kautish et al. 2023; Quesnel and Riecke 2018). Accordingly, we expect that the more people\nperceive AI as magical, the greater their experience of awe, the greater their AI receptivity.\nImportantly, we argue that people with lower AI literacy are more likely to perceive AI as\n\ne\nPe\n\nmagical. Magic often relies on people not understanding or paying attention to how a magic trick\nworks (e.g., Ekroll, Sayim and Wagemans 2017). In much the same way, AI should be perceived\n\nrR\n\nas more magical when people do not understand or pay attention to how AI is able to execute\n\nev\n\ntasks. This is more likely to be the case among those with lower rather than higher AI literacy.\n\niew\n\nWithout technical knowledge about how AI operates\u2014such as the use of algorithms, training\ndata, and computational models\u2014those with lower AI literacy are more likely to perceive AI\u2019s\noutputs as extraordinary or even supernatural. That is, when people with lower AI literacy\n\nVe\n\nenvision AI executing tasks that they believe require distinctly human attributes, they may\n\nrsi\n\nperceive AI executing these tasks as magical because they cannot understand how AI is able to\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\ndo so. In contrast, people with greater AI literacy may be more readily able to understand how\nAI can execute such tasks, without actually possessing human attributes, dampening perceptions\nof magicalness and subsequent awe. Indeed, once a person understands the mechanism behind a\nmagic trick, it seems less magical and can ruin a sense of wonder and excitement for magic more\nbroadly (Braxton 1998).\nTo illustrate, people with lower AI literacy may view AI as possessing a sense of humor\nif it predicts the funniness of a joke, leading to a perception of magicalness and feelings of awe\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 11 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n11\n\nat the thought of AI predicting joke funniness. In contrast, people with higher AI literacy are\nmore likely to understand that through pattern matching and algorithms, it is possible for AI to\npredict joke funniness without having a sense of humor. This demystification of AI as having\ndistinctly human attributes should result in lower perceptions of AI as magical among those with\ngreater AI literacy. In turn, they should experience less awe and exhibit lower AI receptivity. In\nsum, we predict that people with lower AI literacy will exhibit greater AI receptivity, and that\nthis difference will be explained through differences in perceptions of AI as magical and the\n\ne\nPe\n\nensuing feelings of awe that people feel when envisioning AI executing tasks.\nImportantly, our theorization suggests that this effect depends on thinking about AI\n\nrR\n\naccomplishing tasks typically associated with distinctively human attributes (e.g., feeling\n\nev\n\nemotions, having culture, a sense of humor; Santoro and Monin, 2023). That is, when AI\n\niew\n\nexecutes tasks that typically require distinctively human attributes, those with lower (vs. higher)\nAI literacy are more likely to perceive AI as having distinctively human attributes, resulting in\nperceptions of AI as magical and greater AI receptivity. Although AI is distinguished from other\n\nVe\n\nforms of technology in its ability to emulate human intelligence specifically, AI can be used to\n\nrsi\n\nexecute tasks that are more readily recognized as requiring non-distinctly human attributes (e.g.,\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nhaving logic, doing computations, sensing temperature; Santoro and Monin, 2023). When AI\nperforms these types of tasks, perceptions of AI as magical should not be arise and differences in\nAI receptivity should be moderated.\n\nOverview of the Current Research\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 12 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n12\n\nContrary to the results of four forecasting studies and a survey of top executives, seven\nstudies demonstrate that people with lower AI literacy are more receptive towards AI. We\nexplore the relationship between AI literacy and AI receptivity across a range of populations\nincluding students, online participants, and citizens across countries. We employ multiple\nmeasurements of AI literacy to ensure that the results are not a function of any specific way of\nassessing it: a third party measure of AI expertise assessed through AI education, skills, and jobs\n(study 1), a 25-item measure developed by the authors (studies 2, 4, and 6), and a 17-item\n\ne\nPe\n\nmeasure developed by AI (studies 3, 5 and 7). Finally, we operationalized AI receptivity in\nseveral ways. We assess AI receptivity via general measures of AI adoption readiness (studies 1\n\nrR\n\nand 5), propensity to use generative AI for oneself (study 2), frequency of past AI usage (study\n\nev\n\n3), relative preference for human- versus AI-task execution across a range of tasks (studies 4, 6\n\niew\n\nand 7). Study 1 shows that cross-country differences in AI literacy predict country-level variation\nin AI receptivity. Study 2 demonstrates that undergraduate students with lower AI literacy are\nmore receptive to using AI to complete academic assignments compared to those with higher AI\n\nVe\n\nliteracy. Study 3 finds that AI literacy provides predictive ability in explaining AI receptivity,\n\nrsi\n\noperationalized as reported AI usage over the previous six months, beyond other individual\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\ndifferences potentially related to AI literacy (i.e., technology readiness, autonomy, or general\nknowledge). Studies 4 replicates the lower literacy-higher receptivity link, providing evidence\nthat this relationship is mediated through perceptions of AI as magical. Study 5 further provides\nevidence in favor of the role of magical perceptions demonstrating serial mediation through\nensuing feelings of awe and provides evidence that this link occurs despite rather than because of\nalternative explanations based on perceived AI capability and fear of AI\u2019s impact on humanity.\nStudy 6 generalizes the lower literacy-higher receptivity link across a broad range of tasks. Two\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 13 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n13\n\npost-tests reported in Web Appendix E show that these results are not explained by ethicality nor\ncapability perceptions. However, in line with our theorizing, the results are moderated by the\nextent to which tasks are perceived as more objective and less likely to be associated with\ndistinctly human attributes, since such tasks should not elicit perceptions of AI as magical.\nFinally, in study 7, we directly manipulate the extent to which tasks are perceived to necessitate\ndistinctly human attributes for task execution between subjects.

The Global AI Index (GAII) was created by Tortoise Media in 2019 to assess\nthe level of investment, innovation and implementation of AI across countries around the world.\nRelevant to the current research, the 2021 GAII (version 3.0) was extended to include a measure\nof AI \u201ctalent,\u201d (Tortoise Media 2023). The AI talent is a weighted combination of the amount of\n\ne\nPe\n\npeople with AI-related job titles, online programming conversations and activity, and measures\nof AI-related knowledge through coursework by combining data from LinkedIn, GitHub,\n\nrR\n\nUNESCO, Coursera, Kaggle, CRAN, Alexa API, and Google BigQuery within a country. This\n\nev\n\nmeasure should thus capture differences in the level of AI literacy across countries and served as\n\niew\n\nour measure of AI literacy. This measure was available for 62 countries. AI literacy ranged from\n1.72 to 100 (M = 20.51). Since the measure demonstrated a highly skewed distribution, we logtransformed it for our analysis. AI literacy (log transformed) ranges from 0.54 to 4.61 (M =\n2.69).\n\nrsi\n\nVe\n\nAI Receptivity.

This survey asked participants about a\nvariety of perceptions regarding AI. For the purposes of the current research, four of the\nmeasures assessed AI adoption readiness: \u201cProducts and services using artificial intelligence will\nprofoundly change my daily life in the next 3-5 years,\u201d \u201cProducts and services using artificial\nintelligence make my life easier,\u201d \u201cProducts and services using artificial intelligence have more\nbenefits than drawbacks,\u201d and \u201cI trust companies using artificial intelligence as much as I trust\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 16 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n16\n\nother companies.\u201d The survey asked respondents whether they agreed with each of these four\nstatements (yes/no). These data thus indicate, for each of the four measures, the percentage of\nrespondents in each country who indicated they agreed with the statement. These four measures,\navailable for 28 countries, were strongly related (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .983) and we averaged them\ninto an index capturing AI receptivity. AI receptivity ranges from 37.25 to 80.25 (M = 54.97).\nResults and Discussion\nAll countries available in the Ipsos dataset, with the exception of Peru, were available in\n\ne\nPe\n\nthe GAII. Thus, across the two datasets, there were 27 overlapping countries. In line with our\npredictions, regressing AI receptivity on AI literacy revealed that lower levels of AI literacy\n\nrR\n\nwithin a country predicted greater AI receptivity, B= -8.80, 95% CI (-13.67, -3.94), SE = 2.36,\n\nev\n\nt(25) = -3.73, p < .001 (Figure 1). Because the US had a significantly greater literacy score\n\niew\n\ncompared to the other countries, we also examined the relationship across countries, excluding\nthe U.S. Among the remaining 26 countries, there remained a significant negative relationship\nbetween AI literacy within a country and AI receptivity, B = -8.95, 95% CI (-14.53, -3.37), SE =\n\nVe\n\n2.70, t(24) = -3.31, p = .003.

Thus, as a robustness check, we examined the relationship between AI\nliteracy and AI receptivity, adjusting for the Human Development Index (HDI) measured by the\n\nVe\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme (2022).

Table 3 provides the analysis including the\nHDI index (model 2) and the three individual components making up the HDI index (model 3)1.\nNote that excluding the United States does not change the significance level of AI literacy in\neither of these models. For additional robustness, we also considered the GDP growth rate and\npopulation growth rate as further controls. These results provide initial evidence for a negative\nrelationship between AI literacy and AI receptivity.\n\n1 We averaged expected years of schooling and mean years of schooling to create a single education measure.\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 18 of 72\n\n18\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\nTable 3 \u2013 Results of study 1: Cross-country AI literacy predicts AI receptivity.\nModel 1\nNo controls\n\nModel 2\nControlling for HDI\n\nModel 3\nControlling for HDI\ncomponents\n\nModel 4\nControlling for\nHDI components\nand economic\nindicators\n\n-8.804***\n(2.361)\n\n-5.265*\n(2.057)\n\n-5.849**\n(1.990)\n\n-5.858*\n(2.071)\n\n0.174\n(.438)\n\n0.131\n(.462)\n\nEducation\n\n-4.338*\n(1.724)\n\n-4.318*\n(1.829)\n\nIncome\n(GNI, log transformed)\n\n-1.079\n(6.579)\n\n-0.339\n(7.409)\n\nAI literacy\n(log transformed)\nHuman Development\nIndex (HDI)\n\n-82.953***\n(20.575)\n\nLife Expectancy\n\ne\nPe\n\nGDP Growth Rate\nPopulation Growth Rate\n\n78.695***\n(6.653)\n\n140.412***\n(16.181)\n\n128.492**\n(37.209)\n\n121.614*\n(46.241)\n\n.332\n\n.585\n\n.621\n\n.589\n\niew\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n-0.489\n(3.547)\n\nev\n\nIntercept\n\n0.373\n(0.666)\n\nrR\n\nNote: N = 27. *p \u2264 .05; **p \u2264 .01, ***p \u2264 .001.

As another robustness check, we considered the possibility\nthat people with higher AI literacy have a better understanding of the potential pitfalls of\ngenerative AI\u2019s output. If so, people with higher AI literacy may not be less receptive to using AI\nbut believe it cannot be used to the same extent. To examine this possibility, we recoded the\ndependent measure to be a binary variable indicating whether participants would use AI at all.\nThe results showed that those with lower AI literacy were more likely to use AI (at all) compared\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 22 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n22\n\nto those with higher literacy, B = -.13, 95% CI (-.23, -.03), SE = .05, z = -2.65, p < .001.\nOverall, this study shows that students with lower AI literacy exhibit greater propensity\nto use AI to complete their assignments compared to students with higher AI literacy. Notably,\nour study design provided participants with an example of AI\u2019s abilities and held the cost of the\nAI agent constant (i.e., using the generative AI agent was free). Thus, observed differences in\nutilization propensity are unlikely to be explained by differences in expectations of what the AI\u2019s\noutput would be or the cost of using it.\n\ne\nPe\n\nFigure 2 - Lower AI literacy predicts higher propensity to use AI across four assignments.\n\niew\n\nev\n\nrR\non\n\nrsi\n\nVe\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nNotes: Each line in Figure 2 represents a separate linear regression predicting AI utilization from AI literacy for a\nsingle assignment.

If so, people with more\nfrequent past usage would be those with greater, rather than lesser, knowledge \u2013 the opposite of\nthe prediction made by the current theorizing. An additional goal of study 3 is to measure other\nindividual differences that may systematically vary across people with lower and higher AI\nliteracy to examine the unique predictability of AI literacy. Specifically, we consider the\npossibility that people with greater AI literacy may have a generally higher desire for selfreliance and thus have a reduced preference for help of any kind. Since it has been shown that\n\ne\nPe\n\none of the impediments to adoption of autonomous products may be a desire to complete a task\noneself (de Bellis, Johar and Poletti 2023), we measured motivation for autonomy. Additionally,\n\nrR\n\nit is possible that this effect is not specific to AI, and that people with less AI literacy are simply\n\nev\n\nmore inclined to adopt technology of any kind. To examine this, we assess participants\u2019\n\niew\n\ntechnology readiness, a measure of a person\u2019s propensity to adopt new technologies (Victorino et\nal. (2009). Finally, it is possible that AI literacy is simply a proxy of general knowledge, and that\nthis effect stems from people with less general knowledge rather than knowledge of AI\n\nVe\n\nspecifically. Thus, we administer a test of general knowledge across a variety of subjects to see\n\nrsi\n\nwhether AI literacy provided predictive ability beyond general knowledge.\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nAI Literacy Measurement\n\nFor this study, we developed a new measurement of AI literacy based on previously\nidentified AI literacy \u201ccompetencies.\u201d Specifically, Long and Magerko (2020) identify 17\ncompetencies that they consider to be the core foundations of AI literacy. These 17 competencies\nwere described to both Claude.AI and ChatGPT-4. We then asked these AI tools to create one\nmultiple-choice question for each of the 17 competencies. From these two sets, we selected the\nquestion that seemed most representative of the competency for a final set of 17 questions.\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 24 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n24\n\nDetails of the development of this measure and the 17 items are available in Web Appendix B.\nProcedure\nWe posted the survey for 400 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk via Cloud\nResearch. We received 401 completed responses (4 participants did not complete the survey\nbecause they failed the attention check at the beginning of the survey; Mage = 43.9, SD = 13.2;\nFemales = 43.9%, Males = 54.6%, Non-binary/Third gender = .5%, Prefer to not say: 1%).\nWe first measured AI receptivity through participants\u2019 reported frequency of usage of AI-\n\ne\nPe\n\nbased products and services over the previous six months. Specifically, they were asked, \u201cIn the\nlast six months, how often have you used\u2026(1) A digital image generator (e.g., DALL-E,\n\nrR\n\nMidjourney,...), (2) An AI-powered productivity tool for note taking, scheduling, inbox\n\nev\n\nmanagement (e.g., Zapier), (3) An AI-powered design service to create a website (e.g., Canva),\n\niew\n\n(4) An AI-powered health app to meditate, monitor sleep (e.g., Headspace, Sleep.ai), (5) An AItool as a writing assistant (e.g., ChatGPT).\u201d These were all measured on 5-point scales: 1=\nNever, 2 = Once or twice, 3 = Occasionally (more than once or twice but not more than once a\n\nVe\n\nmonth), 4 = Frequently (more than once a month), 5 = On a weekly basis, and combined into an\n\nrsi\n\nindex, coded such that higher numbers on the index indicate greater AI receptivity (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n= .74).\n\nWe then assessed AI literacy with a 17-item measure created by AI, as described above.\nThen, we measured general readiness to adopt technology, desire for self-reliance, and general\nknowledge. Readiness to adopt technology was measured using the Technology Readiness Index\n(TRI) using the 10-item scale from Victorino et al. (2009). We measured general attitudes\ntowards self-reliance versus dependence on others through 4-items assessing motivation for\nautonomy (from Dahl and Moreau 2007): \u201cTo what extent do the following statements describe\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 25 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n25\n\nyou? (1) I want to be free to make my own choices, (2) I want to express myself, (3) I don\u2019t want\nto be controlled, (4) I don\u2019t want to feel pressured (7-point scale: 1 = Not at all, 7 = Extremely).\nGeneral knowledge was measured with 20 multiple choice questions assessing the following four\ntopics (5 questions each): history, biology, geography, and literature. Similarly to how the AI\nliteracy test was created for this study, these questions were generated by AI to be representative\nof knowledge in these areas. Finally, we collected demographic information (gender, age,\nincome).\n\ne\nPe\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nAI literacy. We computed AI literacy by summing the number of correct responses to the\n\nrR\n\n17 questions, such that higher scores indicate higher AI literacy. The median score was 13\n\nev\n\n(range: 1-17, M = 12.5, SD = 2.28).\n\niew\n\nAI receptivity. A linear regression on AI receptivity revealed that lower AI literacy was\nassociated with greater frequency of AI usage, B = -.09, 95% CI (-.13, -.06), SE = .02, t(399) = 5.73, p < .001. AI literacy was unrelated to age (r = .06, p = .214) and income (r = .03, p = .507).\n\nVe\n\nHowever, it was related to other factors. It was positively related to technology readiness (r =\n\nrsi\n\n.27, p < .001), motivation for autonomy (r = .12, p = .015), general knowledge (r = .51, p <\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\n.001), and being male (r = .210, p < .001). Moreover, each of these factors was associated with\npast AI usage, such that technology readiness (r = .17, p < .001) and being male (r = .10, p =\n.037) positively predicted past usage, and motivation for autonomy (r = -.14, p = .007) and\ngeneral knowledge (r = -.24, p < .001) negatively predicted past usage. Therefore, as preregistered, we regressed AI receptivity on AI literacy, technology readiness, motivation for\nautonomy, general knowledge, and gender (male). The results are reported in Model 2 in Table\n4. Even when controlling for these factors, Model 2 regression revealed that lower AI literacy\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 26 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n26\n\nwas associated with greater frequency of AI usage, B = -.11, 95% CI (-.15, -.07), SE = .02, t(373)\n= -5.70, p < .001.\nTable 4 \u2013 Results of Study 3\n\nAI literacy\n\nModel 1\nNo controls\n\nModel 2\nControlling for factors negatively\nassociated with AI receptivity\n\n-.095***\n(.017)\n\n-.110***\n(.019)\n\nTechnology Readiness Index\n\n.033***\n(.006)\n\nGeneral Knowledge\n\n-.027*\n(.012)\n\nMotivation for Autonomy\n\n-.095*\n(.045)\n\nGender (Male)\n\nObservations\n\n2.952***\n(.210)\n\n3.797***\n(.333)\n\n.074\n\n.184\n\niew\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n.250**\n(.076)\n\n379\u2020\n\nev\n\nIntercept\n\nrR\n\ne\nPe\n401\n\nNotes. *p \u2264 .05; **p \u2264 .01, ***p \u2264 .001.

This relationship cannot be explained by people\nwith lower AI literacy liking technology more in general. In fact, people with greater AI literacy\n\n2 In all studies with available demographic information, a robustness check controlling for demographics remained significant.

This relationship is also not explained by differences in motivation\nfor autonomy or general knowledge. In fact, a model that includes these factors leaves the\npredictive ability of AI literacy largely unchanged.\n\nStudy 4: Testing Perceptions of AI as Magical as Process\n\ne\nPe\n\nStudy 4 examines our proposed explanation that the lower literacy-higher receptivity link\nis the result of differential perceptions of AI as magical. We do so by measuring perceptions of\n\nrR\n\nAI as magical and examine whether these perceptions explain the relationship between AI\n\nev\n\nliteracy and AI receptivity. Additionally, study 4 distinguishes receptivity towards AI from\n\niew\n\npropensity to executing the task oneself to ensure that this relationship is not due to a desire to\nderive meaning from executing the task oneself (de Bellis, Johar, and Poletti, 2023).

First, study 5 serves as a conceptual replication\noperationalizing AI literacy with the 17-item measure, and operationalizing AI receptivity using\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 30 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n30\n\nmore general measures of AI receptivity adapted from the IPSOS Global Opinions and\nExpectations about AI Survey (the same measures used in study 1). This measurement allows for\ngeneralizability, as participants can think of any AI-based products and services that come to\ntheir minds. Second, in study 5, we delve further into the proposed mechanism by measuring\nperceptions of AI as magical as well as feelings of awe that are inspired by AI, which we argue\nexplain increased receptivity among people with lower AI literacy. Third, we measure\nperceptions of AI\u2019s capability to complete several tasks to test the alternative explanation that\n\ne\nPe\n\npeople with lower (vs. higher) AI literacy believe that AI is more capable, with differences in\ncapability perceptions explaining differences in receptivity. Finally, we measure fear of the\n\nrR\n\nimpact of AI on humanity to test the alternative explanation that those with lower (vs. higher) AI\n\nev\n\nliteracy are more receptive to AI because they are less worried about the potential negative\neffects of AI for humanity.\nProcedure\n\niew\n\nWe requested 1,000 participants from Prolific Academic.

However, instead of a binary response,\nparticipants indicated their responses on 7-point scales (1 = Not at all, 7 = Very much), and\nresponses were combined into an index (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .83).\nPerceptions of AI as magical were measured as in study 4, although we did not include\n\ne\nPe\n\nthe statement about AI seeming irrational based on its lower conceptual fit (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .91).\nAwe was measured using level of agreement with four items taken from Kautish et al. (2023): \u201cIf\n\nrR\n\nI think about artificial intelligence that powers products and services\u2026 (i) I experience feelings\n\nev\n\nof awe; (ii) I feel that I am witness to something grand; (iii) I perceive vastness and I feel my\n\niew\n\njaw drop; (iv) I have goosebumps and gasp (7-point scales: 1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly\nagree; Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .92). Fear of AI was measured with four items taken from Cave and Dihal\n(2019). Specifically, participants indicated their level of agreement with the following\n\nVe\n\nstatements: (i) I fear that artificial intelligence will make us lose our humanity; (ii) I fear that\n\nrsi\n\nartificial intelligence will turn against humans; (iii) I fear that artificial intelligence will make\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nhumans become obsolete; (iv) I fear that artificial intelligence will make humans lose the ability\nto connect with each other (7-point scales: 1 = Not at all, 7 = Very much; Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .87).\nFinally, we measured AI capability by asking respondents to what extent they thought that an AI\nalgorithm was capable of executing each of the following tasks: (i) Composing a song; (ii)\nRecommending a gift; (iii) Playing the piano; (iv) Writing news article; (v) Driving a car; (vi)\nPiloting a plane; (vii) Recommending music (7-point scales: 1 = Definitely incapable, 7 =\nDefinitely capable). Note that these seven tasks are a subset of the tasks used in Castelo, Bos,\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 32 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n32\n\nand Lehman (2019; study 1). The seven measures assessing AI capability perceptions cohered\nwell (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .83) and were combined. Finally, we collected gender, age, and income.\nResults and Discussion\nAI literacy. We computed an AI literacy score for each participant as in previous studies.\nThe median score was 13 (range: 1-17, M = 12.55, SD = 2.28).\nAI receptivity. As predicted, participants with lower AI literacy scores indicated greater\nAI receptivity, B = -.04, 95% CI (-.07, -.01), SE = .02, t(998) = -2.25, p = .024.\n\ne\nPe\n\nPerceptions of AI as magical. Participants with lower AI literacy perceived AI as more\nmagical than those with higher AI literacy, B = -.13, 95% CI (-.17, -.10), SE = .02, t(998) = 6.83, p < .001.\n\nev\n\nrR\n\nExperience of Awe. Participants with lower AI literacy reported experiencing greater\n\niew\n\nfeelings of awe when thinking about AI powering products and services, B = -.14, 95% CI (-.18,\n-.10), SE = .02, t(998) = -6.79, p < .001.\n\nSerial Mediation. Before examining serial mediation, we conducted a factor analysis on\n\nVe\n\nthe set of measures assessing perceptions of AI as magical and experience of awe to examine the\n\nrsi\n\ndistinctiveness of the constructs. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis suggested\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nthat these factors were related but separate constructs. Serial mediation using Hayes\u2019s (2017)\nPROCESS model 6 macro with 10,000 bootstrapped samples provided support for the proposed\nmediation, 95% CI (-.05, -.02).\nCapability of AI. In contrast to the alternative explanation that people with lower AI\nliteracy perceive AI as more capable, we found a positive association such that those with lower\nAI literacy perceived AI as less capable, B = .07, 95% CI (.04, .10), SE = .01, t(998) = 4.94, p <\n.001.\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 33 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n33\n\nFear of AI. In contrast to the alternative explanation that people with lower AI literacy\nare less fearful of AI\u2019s impact on humanity, we found a negative association such that those with\nlower AI literacy were more fearful of AI than those with higher AI literacy, B = -.09, 95% CI (.13, -.04), SE = .02, t(998) = -3.56, p < .001.\nStudy 5 provides more evidence in support of our proposed account. Differences in AI\nreceptivity across AI literacy are serially mediated by perceptions of AI as magical and the awe\nexperienced in thinking about AI powering products and services. Notably, these results cast\n\ne\nPe\n\ndoubt on the alternative explanation of perceptions of AI capability. Those with lower AI literacy\nrated AI as less capable of executing tasks. This suggests that people with lower AI literacy are\n\nrR\n\nmore receptive towards AI despite believing it is less capable. Moreover, study 5 suggests that\n\nev\n\ndifferences in AI receptivity are not a function of fear of AI, since those with lower AI literacy\n\niew\n\nare more fearful of AI\u2019s potential impact on humanity. As such, including capability and fear in\nthe analysis increases rather than decreases the relationship between AI literacy and AI\nreceptivity. These findings suggest that people with lower AI literacy are more receptive to AI-\n\nVe\n\nbased products and services in spite of, rather than because of, their fear about AI and beliefs in\n\nrsi\n\nAI\u2019s capabilities. In line with this interpretation, in a supplemental study reported in Web\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nAppendix D, we find directional evidence that encouraging people to base their decisions on\ncapability and efficiency weakens the link between AI literacy and AI receptivity.\n\nStudy 6: AI literacy and AI Receptivity as a Function of Task Characteristics\n\nWe have suggested that differential perceptions of AI as magical across levels of AI\nliteracy result from differences in how people interpret AI\u2019s ability to execute tasks once thought\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 34 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n34\n\nto require exclusively human attributes. Generally, viewing AI as capable of executing such\ntasks fosters a perception of magic; however, individuals with higher AI literacy recognize that\nAI does not need human-like attributes to accomplish these tasks and dampens perceptions of AI\nas magical. The lower literacy-higher receptivity link emerged using general measures of AI\nadoption readiness (studies 1 and 5), which suggest that the lower literacy-higher receptivity link\ndoes not artificially rely on our choice of tasks. However, our line of reasoning suggests that\ndifferences in AI receptivity should be moderated when tasks do not require distinctly human\n\ne\nPe\n\nattributes (e.g., objective tasks such as data analysis). By exploring process through the potential\nmoderating impact of task characteristics, this study aims to address the limitations of the\n\nrR\n\napproach of using mediation to examine process (e.g., Bullock, Green & Ha, 2010; Imai et al.,\n\nev\n\n2011). Finally, we counterbalance whether the AI literacy test comes before or after the measure\n\niew\n\nof AI receptivity, to explore potential order effects.\nProcedure\n\nWe posted the survey for 1,000 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk via Cloud\n\nVe\n\nResearch. We received 1,184 responses4 (13 participants did not complete the survey because\n\nrsi\n\nthey failed the attention check at the beginning of the survey). Thirty-two participants failed the\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nIMC at the end of the survey, five participants that skipped an attention check question, and an\nadditional 35 participants indicated answering the questions randomly (2 of whom also indicated\nnot trying their best), leaving us with a final sample of 1,099 participants (Mage = 46.3, SD =\n60.3; Females = 50.1%, Males = 48.2%, Non-binary/Third gender = .7%, Prefer to not say: 1%).\nAI literacy was assessed with the 25-item measure used in study 2. Participants\u2019 AI\nreceptivity, the dependent measure, relied on a paradigm used by Castelo, Bos, and Lehman\n\n4 There was an error with the survey completion code which may have led to the higher-than-expected number of\n\nsurvey completions.\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 35 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n35\n\n(2019; study 1). Specifically, participants read that we wanted them to consider various tasks that\ncould be carried out either by a person or automated and carried out by an AI algorithm and to\nrate their preference to have the key decision for that task carried out by a human versus an AI\nalgorithm. For each of 26 tasks, briefly described and presented in random order (e.g., predicting\njoke funniness, hiring and firing employees, recommending a romantic partner, predicting\nstudent performance, etc.), participants expressed a preference to have the target task carried out\nby a human or an AI algorithm using a 7-point scale (1 = Definitely prefer the human, 4 =\n\ne\nPe\n\nIndifferent, 7 = Definitely prefer the AI algorithm).\nWe then collected demographic variables (gender, age, household income), political\n\nrR\n\nideology, and religiosity. The survey ended with three attention checks. One was the same IMC\n\nev\n\nused in study 2. In line with prior research (Pennycook, Cannon, Rand 2018), we also included\n\niew\n\ntwo attention checks: participants were asked (i) if they responded to the best of their abilities\nand (ii) if they responded randomly at any point during the survey (yes / no binary answer for\nboth).\nResults and Discussion\n\nrsi\n\nVe\n\nAI literacy. We computed the AI literacy score for each participant as in previous studies.\nThe median score was 19 (range: 4-25, M = 18.49, SD = 3.81).\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nAI receptivity. As pre-registered, we calculated AI receptivity by averaging preferences\nacross the 26 tasks into an index, coded such that higher numbers on the index indicate greater\nAI receptivity (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .92). A linear regression on average AI receptivity revealed that\nlower AI literacy was associated with greater relative preference for AI task execution, B = -.05,\n95% CI (-.06, -.03), SE = .01, t(1097) = -6.39, p < .001. We also explored whether this\nrelationship depended on whether we assessed AI literacy before or after AI receptivity using\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 36 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n36\n\norder as an additional factor in the analysis. Regressing AI receptivity on AI literacy, order, and\ntheir interaction revealed only a main effect of AI literacy, B = -.04, 95% CI (-.06, -.02), SE =\n.01, t(1095) = -3.50, p < .001. Both the effect of order (B= .24, 95% CI (-.30,.78), SE = .28,\nt(1095) = .86, p = .389) and the interaction (B = -.02, 95% CI (-.04, .01), SE = .01, t(1095) = 1.05, p = .295) were not significant5.\nTask characteristics. Although we found an overall negative relationship, such that\npeople with lower AI literacy were more likely to prefer tasks be completed by AI, we explored\n\ne\nPe\n\nwhether this difference depended on the level of objectivity required to complete each task.\nSubjective tasks are more likely to typically require more distinctively human attributes (e.g.,\n\nrR\n\nhaving a sense of humor) while objective tasks are more likely to typically require attributes\n\nev\n\nknown to be shared by humans and AI (e.g., doing computations). As pre-registered, we asked a\n\niew\n\nseparate sample of 50 respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk (following the inclusion\ncriteria from the main study, 47 participants were included in the analysis) to rate each of the 26\ntasks on the perceived degree of subjectivity versus objectivity using definitions provided by\n\nVe\n\nCastelo, Bos, and Lehman (2019), \u201cFor each task, we would like you to tell us if you think that\n\nrsi\n\nthe task is mostly subjective or mostly objective.

We then ran a mixed regression model, regressing AI\npreference for each individual task on participants\u2019 mean-centered AI literacy score, the meancentered objectivity score of the given task, and their interaction, with a random intercept for\n\n5 Results remain consistent in a linear mixed model that includes fixed effects for each task and a random effect for\n\neach subject.\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 37 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n37\n\neach participant to account for the repeated measures. This model replicated the negative\nrelationship between AI literacy and AI receptivity, B = -.05, 95% CI (-.06, -.03), SE = .01,\nt(1096.61) = -6.38, p < .001. In line with past research, objectivity positively predicted AI\nreceptivity, B = .01, 95% CI (.01, .01), SE < .01, t(27456.70) = 16.87, p < .001. However, there\nwas evidence of a significant interaction, B = .001, 95% CI (.001, .001), SE < .01, t(27456.53) =\n7.59, p < .001. Although those with lower AI literacy had generally greater AI receptivity, this\ndifference was smaller among tasks requiring more objectivity (Figure 3).\n\ne\nPe\n\nTo more directly test our theory, we ran a subsequent post-test to evaluate whether each\nof the 26 tasks was believed to require more distinctively human attributes versus attributes\n\nrR\n\nbelieved to be shared among humans and AI.

Moreover, in line with our proposed theorization, the relationship between AI\nliteracy and AI receptivity is more pronounced among tasks that are subjective and those that\ntypically require more distinctively human attributes, which are more likely to evoke perceptions\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 39 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n39\n\nof AI as magical.\n\nIn two separate post-tests, which we report in full detail in the Web Appendix E, we test\ntwo alternative accounts for the lower literacy-higher receptivity link. It is possible that people\nwith lower AI literacy perceive the use of AI to complete tasks as more ethical, or that they\nperceive AI as more capable than those with higher AI literacy. We explore these alternative\nexplanations in two post-tests, one focused on perceived ethicality and one focused on perceived\ncapability of having AI complete each of the 26 tasks used in study 6. These post-tests show that,\n\ne\nPe\n\ndespite exhibiting greater AI receptivity, people with lower AI literacy perceive AI as less ethical\nthan people with higher AI literacy, refuting an account based on perceived ethicality.\n\nrR\n\nFurthermore, people with lower AI literacy do not perceive AI as being more capable than\n\nev\n\npeople with higher AI literacy, which is inconsistent with an account based on perceived\ncapability.\n\niew\n\nStudy 7: Moderation by Tasks\u2019 Propensity to Elicit Perceptions of AI as Magical\n\nrsi\n\nVe\n\nAs Study 6 demonstrated, the lower literacy-higher receptivity link appears to be\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nmoderated by the extent to which people believe the task requires distinctly human attributes.\nHowever, the tasks in that study differed in several ways. Thus, to more directly test our theory,\nStudy 7 holds constant the category of tasks while manipulating, between subjects, the extent to\nwhich the target tasks require distinctly human attributes or not since tasks that are not perceived\nto require human attributes to execute the tasks should not elicit feelings of AI as magical\nregardless of AI literacy levels.\nProcedure\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 40 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n40\n\nThis study was run in partnership with Toluna, a market research company with a panel\nof consumers who complete company surveys for rewards points. We requested 1,000 completed\nsurveys. This experiment included, as pre-registered, two attention checks at the beginning of the\nsurvey and only participants who answered correctly were allowed to complete the survey. In\ntotal, we received 1018 people passed the attention check questions and we received completed\nresponses from 1006 participants (Mage = 51.35, SD = 16.55; Females = 77.3%, Males = 22.7%).\nThis study entailed 2 between-subjects conditions that varied the types of attributes\n\ne\nPe\n\n(distinct attributes vs. shared attributes) needed to complete tasks. To create these conditions, we\nprovided AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) a list of distinctly human attributes and a list of shared\n\nrR\n\nattributes as identified by Santoro and Monin (2023) and asked it to create pairs of tasks that\n\nev\n\ncome from the same general category (e.g., news reporting) where one of the tasks would require\n\niew\n\nmore distinctively human attributes and the other would require more shared attributes for task\nexecution. From these, we created a set of 10 pairs of tasks covering cooking, art, architecture,\nnews reporting, fashion, advertising, customer experience innovation, customer engagement and\n\nVe\n\nretention, healthcare, and hospitality management, where the two tasks varied in the extent to\n\nrsi\n\nwhich they required distinctly human attributes or not. For example, in the news reporting\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\ncategory, the task that required more distinctly human attribute was \u201cwriting an opinionated\neditorial piece for a news outlet\u201d and the one that required more shared attributes was \u201cfactchecking and verifying sources for a news outlet.\u201d Differences in perceptions of the importance\nof distinctly human versus shared attributes for task execution across the pairs of tasks were\nvalidated in a pre-test with 102 participants on Cloud Connect, t(101) = -24.63, p < .001 (Web\nAppendix F for details). For each of the 10 tasks, participants rated the extent to which they\nwould prefer to have the key decision for that task carried out by a human or by an AI algorithm\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 41 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n41\n\non a 7-point scale (1 = Definitely prefer the human, 7 = Definitely prefer the AI algorithm). We\nassessed AI literacy with the 17-item test used in study 3 and 5.

As pre-registered, we calculated AI receptivity by averaging preferences\n\nrR\n\nacross the 10 tasks into an index, coded such that higher numbers on the index indicate greater\n\nev\n\nAI receptivity (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .89). We regressed this receptivity rating on their AI literacy\n\niew\n\nscore (mean-centered), condition (0 = shared, 1 = distinct), and their interaction.

However, this\nrelationship reversed for tasks associated with shared attributes between humans and AI. This\nreversal helps to reconcile the fact that people with higher literacy perceive AI as more capable,\nbut generally have lower receptivity. Absent the \u201cmagical\u201d element, those with higher AI literacy\ndemonstrate greater receptivity.\n\nGeneral Discussion\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 43 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n43\n\nAI is rapidly transforming our society. Research to date has typically focused on\nsituational processes to understand differences in AI receptivity. Our research highlights the\nimportance of considering systematic differences across people, demonstrating that differences\nin AI literacy across people predict differences in AI receptivity. In contrast to what was\npredicted in four separate forecasting surveys and a survey of executives, seven studies using\ndiverse samples supported the predicted lower literacy-higher receptivity link.\nPeople with lower AI literacy were more receptive to personally using AI to execute\n\ne\nPe\n\ntasks (studies 2-3). This link was not due to feelings of personally autonomy as it generalized to\npreferences for tasks to be executed by AI versus a human (studies 4, 6, 7). Moreover, this link\n\nrR\n\nemerged when receptivity was operationalized as general measures of AI adoption readiness\n\nev\n\n(studies 1-5), suggesting this relationship exists in the absence of any specific task being\n\niew\n\nhighlighted. We explain this link through perceptions of AI as magical. When people think about\nAI executing tasks that are typically associated with requiring distinctly human attributes, those\nwith lower AI literacy are more likely to believe that AI actually possesses these human-like\n\nVe\n\nattributes, leading to greater perceptions of AI as magical and feelings of awe. In line with this\n\nrsi\n\ntheorizing, perceptions of AI as magical and ensuing feelings of awe explained the lower\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nliteracy-higher receptivity link (studies 4-5). Moreover, the lower literacy-higher receptivity link\nwas moderated when participants explicitly considered tasks that were assumed to not require\ndistinctly human attributes (studies 6-7). This link was not explained by participants\u2019 general\nknowledge, their attitudes towards self-reliance versus dependence, nor their general readiness to\nadopt technology (study 3). Further, our results suggest that this link emerged despite rather than\nbecause of differences in perceptions of AI capability (study 5, study 6 post-test), ethicality\n(study 6 post-test), and fear of its impact on humanity (study 5).\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 44 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n44\n\nTheoretical and Managerial Implications\n\nFirst, we contribute to research on the psychological responses to AI (Puntoni et al.\n2021; Valenzuela et al. 2024). Whereas prior work in this area has predominantly investigated\nsituational factors, we focus on the overlooked question of how differences across consumers\ninfluence AI receptivity. In doing so, our research suggests a need for future research to identify\nother such individual-level differences. By considering individual traits, attitudes, and\npredispositions, researchers can better comprehend the underlying motivations and preferences\n\ne\nPe\n\nthat shape individuals\u2019 propensity to use AI-based products and services, enabling better\ndevelopment of predictive models, and improving customization and targeting of AI solutions.\n\nrR\n\nSecond, our theorizing offers a means of reconciling seemingly conflicting findings\n\nev\n\nregarding people\u2019s responses to new technologies. Prior work has documented both cases in\n\niew\n\nwhich consumers exhibit favorable responses towards new technologies (i.e., \u201cautomation bias,\u201d\nor \u201calgorithm appreciation\u201d, e.g., Mosier and Skitka 2018; Longoni and Cian 2022) and cases\nwhen consumers are averse to new technologies (i.e., \u201calgorithm aversion,\u201d e.g., Dietvorst,\n\nVe\n\nSimmon and Massey 2015). By identifying perceptions of AI as magical and the accompanying\n\nrsi\n\nfeelings of awe as important yet so far overlooked predictors of AI receptivity, we suggest that\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nwhether consumers will be receptive to new technologies will hinge on individual level (e.g.,\nliteracy about the new technology) and situational (e.g., whether the new technology performs\ntasks associated with distinctly human attributes or not) factors that affect perceptions of new\ntechnologies as magical.\nThird, our research offers important and timely managerial implications, as it suggests\nthat companies\u2019 product management and marketing efforts should be tailored to different group\nof consumers. While the insurance company executives we surveyed unanimously believed that\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 45 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n45\n\ntargeting consumers with higher AI literacy would be more effective for marketing AI products,\nour findings suggest otherwise. New AI-based products and services may be more readily\nadopted among those with lower literacy, particularly for applications that are believed to be\nassociated with distinctly human attributes.\nTo the extent that companies target low AI literacy consumers, it is important that they\ndesign AI products and services with the welfare and needs of these consumers in mind. Indeed,\nthese recommendations should not be taken as a call to exploit low AI literacy consumers and\n\ne\nPe\n\ntheir potential vulnerability to new AI initiatives. Instead, these insights highlight an opportunity\nto develop and market AI products for a potentially overlooked yet highly receptive audience.\n\nrR\n\nFurther, the results of study 7 suggest that there are opportunities to target not only those\n\nev\n\nwith lower AI literacy, but also those with higher AI literacy, as long as these two groups of\n\niew\n\nconsumers are targeted differently. Specifically, our findings suggest that marketing efforts\naiming to make AI more accessible to a broader audience by demystifying how AI works may\ninadvertently reduce consumers\u2019 receptivity towards AI by making it seem less magical. Thus,\n\nVe\n\nmarketing efforts targeting low AI literacy consumers may benefit from promoting an aura of\n\nrsi\n\nmagic around AI by emphasizing how the AI powering the respective product or service\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nemulates human characteristics. Conversely, marketing efforts targeting high AI literacy\nconsumers may benefit from highlighting how their AI-based products and services execute tasks\nthat are based on characteristics shared between humans and AI.\nLimitations and Future Research\nMeaningfully changing people\u2019s AI literacy is difficult, especially in a short time frame.\nIt typically requires motivation from the learner as well as calibrating materials and tailoring\ncontent to a person\u2019s current AI literacy (Long and Magerko 2020). Thus, the current research\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 46 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n46\n\nrelied on measuring consumers\u2019 AI literacy and demonstrating process through mediation and\nmoderation. However, future research should examine how AI literacy initiatives causally affect\nAI receptivity and whether the content and style of AI education influence this relationship.\nThe lower literacy-higher receptivity link emerged when AI literacy was measured using\na human-constructed and validated measure (studies 2, 4, 6), an AI-constructed measure based\non AI competencies identified in previous research (studies 3, 5, 7), and when based on countrylevel differences in AI expertise associated with AI-related proficiencies and skills (study 1).\n\ne\nPe\n\nOne may wonder whether AI literacy should be conceptualized as a single factor or whether\nthere are important sub factors that should be analyzed separately. Factor analyses performed on\n\nrR\n\nboth the 25-item measure and the 17-item measure produced scree plots that supported a single\n\nev\n\nfactor solution. Further, our results are robust to separately analyzing questions assessing\n\niew\n\ntechnical understanding and limitations and ethical considerations (see Web Appendix C).\nHowever, we note that these subfactors are highly correlated. Future research may develop\nmeasures of subcomponents of AI literacy that are more statistically distinct.\n\nVe\n\nOur results suggest that as people become more AI literate over time, general AI\n\nrsi\n\nreceptivity may decrease. Thus, our findings suggest that until capability considerations\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\noutweigh AI receptivity fueled by perceptions of AI as magical, there may be unintended\nconsequences of policymakers\u2019 efforts to educate the public about AI. Of course, other factors\u2014\nsuch as shifting norms and expectations about AI adoption, or improvements in AI capabilities\u2014\nmay affect and change the nature of the relationship between literacy and receptivity over time.\nFuture research could examine the lower literacy-higher receptivity link longitudinally.\n\nJournal of Marketing\n\n\fPage 47 of 72\n\nAuthor Accepted Manuscript\n\n47\n\nReferences\n\naiEDU (2023), \u201cAI in 5 Minutes,\u201d (accessed June 6, 2023), https://www.aiedu.org/ai-in-five.\nBraxton, Greg (1998), \u201cDisillusioned Magicians in Protest,\u201d (May 2), https://shorturl.at/ZFq1J\nBrynjolfsson, E., Li, D., and Raymond, L.

These data sources included the AI Education Project (aiEDU\n2023), UNESCO\u2019s Algorithm & Data Literacy project (Digital Moment 2023), and the National\nUniversity of Singapore's library on digital literacy (NUS 2023).\n\ne\nPe\n\nThis led to the development of a set of 47 possible questions conceptual and technical\nknowledge, best practices in AI development and usage, and regulatory requirements. At this\n\nrR\n\npoint, we sought feedback from several data scientists and programmers on the initial set of\nquestions. We asked them to evaluate the questions based on their relevance, accuracy, potential\n\nev\n\nto become obsolete or change over time, comprehensibility, and any other feedback. This\n\niew\n\nreduced our pool to 30 questions, as 17 questions were deemed irrelevant, too niche to measure\nactual AI literacy, too easy or too difficult. Simultaneously, we asked an AI program, ChatGPT 3,\n\nVe\n\nto similarly evaluate the questions and provide explanations for the answers to identify questions\nthat could plausibly be confusing, have multiple answers, or may be subject to change over time.\n\nrsi\n\nThis step resulted in an additional 7 questions that were deemed to be problematic (e.g., AI\n\non\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n\nsuggested that a different response was possibly correct), two overlapping with questions that\nwere excluded based on feedback from the data scientists and programmers. Thus, in total, the\ninitial set of 47 questions was refined to 25 questions.

            "**Integrated Literature Review on Algorithm-Driven Marketing, Machinewashing, and AI Literacy**\n\nIn recent years, scholarship on consumer behavior and marketing has turned its attention to how algorithmic technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) influence consumer perceptions, decision-making, and broader societal outcomes. Extant research has explored how organizations harness AI to deliver personalized experiences (e.g., Shen, Hu, & Yin, 2025a) and has begun to question whether such algorithmic efforts may trigger counterproductive or misleading marketing tactics (e.g., Seele & Schultz, 2022). Moreover, as the adoption of AI accelerates, scholars have increasingly examined which factors drive consumers to accept or reject AI applications (e.g., Tully, Longoni, & Appel, 2025). Throughout this literature, two central themes emerge: (1) the power of AI and algorithms in shaping consumer identity, preferences, and trust, and (2) the organizational strategies (and potential misrepresentations) that firms employ to promote their AI capabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Algorithmic Influence on Consumer Identity and Product Preferences\n\nA strand of literature emphasizes how AI-generated or algorithm-generated information about consumers can activate social identities and nudge behavior in identity-consistent ways (Shen, Hu, & Yin, 2025a). In particular, AI platforms can label or categorize consumers\u2014e.g., identifying someone as a \u201chealthy eater\u201d or \u201crisk-averse investor\u201d\u2014based on prior data and responses. These identity labels, especially when perceived as accurate or generated by neutral, data-driven processes, can lead individuals to align more strongly with the implied identities. Studies have found, for instance, that people exposed to algorithmically generated identity labels may exhibit a heightened preference for products consistent with that identity category (Shen et al., 2025a). This phenomenon extends prior work on social labeling by showing that perceptions of algorithmic objectivity can amplify the label\u2019s effect.\n\nSimultaneously, other scholarship underscores the importance of the source of identity labeling (Shen, Hu, & Yin, 2025b). Specifically, algorithmic labels can appear more \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201cunbiased\u201d than labels generated by human experts, leading to increased receptivity. Consumers may feel that a machine-based categorization is grounded in extensive data analysis, thereby conferring heightened credibility. However, these effects hinge on consumers\u2019 trust in AI systems\u2014if a system\u2019s accuracy or fairness comes into question, the label\u2019s influence could backfire (Tully et al., 2025).\n\n---\n\n### AI, Corporate Self-Promotion, and Machinewashing\n\nAdvances in AI have not only affected consumer decisions but also prompted firms to strategically tout their AI capabilities. Vorobeva et al. (2025) examine \u201cbragging\u201d about valuable resources such as advanced AI-based technology or skilled human employees. They document how firms may publicly highlight these resources\u2014what the authors term \u201cself-promotion\u201d\u2014to enhance perceptions of innovation, competence, and competitive advantage. Yet such AI-related self-promotion can backfire when it crosses the line into exaggerated claims or is perceived as \u201cmachinewashing,\u201d whereby organizations overstate or misrepresent the ethicality or capabilities of their AI (Seele & Schultz, 2022).\n\nIndeed, machinewashing parallels the older concept of \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d wherein firms overstate their environmental bona fides (Seele & Schultz, 2022). Seele and Schultz propose that as AI proliferates, \u201cmachinewashing\u201d may arise whenever organizations leverage AI as a marketing facade without substantially delivering on ethical or performance promises. By analogy, the authors suggest that machinewashing involves symbolic action (e.g., ethics boards, AI manifestos) that may be decoupled from actual practice, often aimed at heading off regulatory scrutiny or appealing to an audience\u2019s fascination with AI. Thus, while AI-based products can generate legitimate consumer benefits, firms may attempt to capitalize on the mystique of AI to boost their reputations without full transparency regarding AI\u2019s limitations or ethical risks.\n\nThese concerns intersect with \u201cbragging about valuable resources,\u201d as companies publicize their AI and skilled human employees to signal innovativeness, competence, or moral responsibility (Vorobeva et al., 2025). Yet such \u201cbragging,\u201d if poorly grounded, can be seen as cynical impression management, especially if the firm\u2019s actual AI usage is minimal or does not align with ethical guidelines. This finding underscores the importance of clear AI governance frameworks, third-party auditing, and thoughtful communication strategies\u2014lest machinewashing erode public trust (Seele & Schultz, 2022).\n\n---\n\n### Consumer Literacy, Trust, and Receptivity Toward AI\n\nContrary to managerial intuition, Tully, Longoni, and Appel (2025) reveal in their multi-study investigation that consumers\u2019 **AI literacy**\u2014i.e., their objective knowledge about how AI systems function\u2014has an inverse relationship with AI receptivity. Conventional wisdom would assume that consumers who understand AI better might be more eager to adopt AI-driven solutions. However, Tully et al. (2025) show that those with *lower* AI literacy tend to find AI more \u201cmagical\u201d and experience awe at AI\u2019s apparent human-like capabilities (e.g., producing creative content). This sense of magic and wonder can overshadow rational considerations regarding AI\u2019s limitations or ethical pitfalls, thus fostering more positive attitudes toward adopting AI services. By contrast, individuals higher in AI literacy see behind the curtain, so to speak. Realizing that AI\u2019s seemingly human attributes or creative flair stem from pattern-matching and algorithmic processes, they perceive AI less as magical. They also more readily detect potential biases or data problems, diminishing their overall enthusiasm for using AI in subjective domains (Tully et al., 2025).\n\nAs the lower-literacy consumer group appears more prone to adopt AI, marketing strategies that highlight AI\u2019s mystical power could inadvertently appeal to them (Shen et al., 2025a). However, Tully et al. (2025) caution that overemphasizing AI\u2019s \u201cmagic\u201d might create illusions and reduce critical scrutiny of AI\u2019s real capabilities or potential biases\u2014dangers reminiscent of \u201cmachinewashing\u201d (Seele & Schultz, 2022). Yet many organizations, as Vorobeva et al. (2025) note, may be tempted to publicize advanced AI resources precisely to evoke such fascination. This tension sets the stage for future research into how firms can responsibly communicate the benefits of AI while ensuring that less-literate consumers are not misled.\n\nFindings by Tully and colleagues (2025) also show that lower AI literacy consumers can be receptive to tasks typically seen as requiring human intuition or creativity, reinforcing that consumer acceptance depends not solely on rational cost-benefit analysis but also on emotional responses to AI\u2019s capabilities. Interestingly, consumers with high AI literacy remain open to AI for objective, data-intensive tasks\u2014often where AI truly excels (Shen et al., 2025b; Tully et al., 2025). This nuance\u2014consumers toggling between wonder-driven acceptance and rational caution\u2014suggests an interplay between technology design, task type, and consumer knowledge.\n\n---\n\n### Toward a More Nuanced Understanding of Algorithmic Technologies\n\nTaken together, the recent literature points to the need for a more nuanced understanding of algorithmic marketing, consumer knowledge about AI, and corporate ethics. While Shen et al. (2025a) highlight how algorithm-generated identity labels can systematically shape product choices, Tully et al. (2025) show that not all consumers respond similarly to these automated or AI-based interventions. Consumers who lack in-depth AI literacy can be more open to adopting AI solutions or ascribing greater \u201chuman-like\u201d qualities to algorithms. Conversely, those with greater AI literacy are sometimes more skeptical or critical, especially for tasks requiring emotional intelligence or creativity. This dichotomy in consumer segments underscores the necessity of segmentation strategies.\n\nAt the same time, Vorobeva et al. (2025) remind us that companies often highlight their AI capabilities for competitive advantage, risking \u201cmachinewashing\u201d (Seele & Schultz, 2022) if the claimed benefits are not substantiated. In parallel, research by Shen et al. (2025b) demonstrates that organizations may see superior success if they label or target identity segments, yet this success could be ephemeral if corporate ethics or transparency are lacking (Seele & Schultz, 2022). Altogether, these articles emphasize the complexity of employing AI in marketing, wherein both organizational self-promotion strategies and consumers\u2019 illusions about AI interweave.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nThe confluence of algorithmic personalization, corporate AI self-promotion, and consumer heterogeneity in AI literacy produces a rich terrain for scholars and practitioners. On one hand, AI\u2019s potential can enhance marketing effectiveness, drive product customization, and improve consumer experiences (Shen et al., 2025a). On the other hand, it may spur organizational bragging and machinewashing if firms exaggerate their AI resources or ethical standards (Seele & Schultz, 2022; Vorobeva et al., 2025). Moreover, consumers\u2019 divergent conceptions of AI\u2014some in awe, some attuned to pitfalls\u2014complicate the path to sustainable AI adoption (Tully et al., 2025).\n\nFuture research would benefit from longitudinal studies to track how AI literacy evolves over time and how it alters consumer responses to AI-based marketing. Efforts to educate consumers about AI might reduce illusions of magic but also potentially diminish positive engagement with AI in subjective domains (Tully et al., 2025). Investigations into improved corporate communications and external auditing could mitigate the risk of machinewashing, balancing the legitimate highlighting of AI achievements with transparent disclosures of limitations (Seele & Schultz, 2022). Moreover, bridging these perspectives with the identity labeling literature (Shen et al., 2025a, 2025b) will illuminate how to design algorithm-driven experiences that are ethical, credible, and sustainable. As organizations increasingly rely on algorithmic solutions, scholars must address these questions to promote beneficial outcomes for firms, consumers, and society.\n\n---\n\n### References (APA Style)\n\n1. **Shen, Z., Hu, Y., & Yin, Y.

Do not reference or cite any work outside the PDFs provided.\n\n \n\nCONTEXT \u2022 The topic is how organisations have pivoted to market their products as AI products to consumers and stakeholders. \u2022 Some articles discuss \u201cmachinewashing,\u201d defined as \u201ca strategy that organisations adopt to engage in misleading behaviour about ethical AI/algorithmic systems by providing or omitting misleading information, and using symbolic actions such as lobbying or preventing stricter regulation.\u201d While the concept includes misleading behaviour, the focus here is on how organisations portray their products as AI-driven rather than on deception components. \u2022 When using information from a PDF, cite the original sources it references if the idea is attributed to them. If the idea is unique to that PDF, cite the PDF itself.\n\n \n\nYOUR TASK Produce a structured and coherent literature review following these guidelines:\n\n \n\nProvide Comprehensive Summaries with Formal In-Text Citations\n\n \n\nSummarise all relevant studies on how organisations pivot to position products as AI products.\n\nUse concise academic language and provide in-text citations in the format (Author et al., Year).\n\nMaintain consistency in citation style, ensuring you cite the PDF or the original cited work within the PDF correctly.\n\nIdentify and Organise Overarching Themes\n\n \n\nAfter summarising, highlight main themes or categories that emerge (e.g., rebranding strategies, stakeholder perceptions, methodological approaches, etc.).\n\nOrganise these themes logically, demonstrating how they relate to each other in the broader context of AI marketing.\n\nSynthesise Sources into a Cohesive Narrative\n\n \n\nIntegrate identified themes and findings into a unified discussion.\n\nShow how studies build upon, refine, or contrast with each other.\n\nDo not individually list every piece of evidence; rather, synthesise them to tell a coherent story about how organisations leverage AI marketing.\n\nMaintain an Academic Tone with Structured Subheadings\n\n \n\nWrite in a formal academic style suitable for publication in the Academy of Management.\n\nUse descriptive subheadings to guide the reader (e.g. \u201c2.1 Conceptual Foundations of AI Branding\u201d), ensuring clear organisation and flow.\n\nUse Only the Provided PDFs for Evidence\n\n \n\nDo not bring in outside research or citations.\n\nAccurately reference the PDFs when citing an idea unique to that PDF.\n\nIf the PDF attributes the idea to another original source, cite the original source.\n\nADDITIONAL CITATION EXAMPLES\n\n\u2022 If a PDF provides a quote or concept originally from a different work (e.g., \u201c(Becker-Olsen & Potucek, 2013)\u201d), cite it exactly as indicated (Becker-Olsen & Potucek, 2013) rather than the PDF itself.\n\n\u2022 If the PDF contains an original idea (e.g., \u201cFurthermore, and going beyond greenwashing, machinewashing may be used for symbolic actions...\u201d), cite the PDF directly (e.g., \u201c(PDF Title, Year)\u201d).\n\n \n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS\n\n\u2022 Deliver a single literature review document.\n\n\u2022 Structure it with headings and subheadings.\n\n\u2022 Maintain proper in-text citations and a consistent referencing style throughout.\n\n \n\nREMINDER\n\nAdhere strictly to these instructions, and only base your review on the provided PDFs. Compliance with these guidelines is essential.\n\n "

            "## Outline\n\n- **Introduction** \u2013 Overview of the trend of organizations rebranding or repositioning products as \u201cAI-driven\u201d amid the growing adoption of AI. Motivate why this is a relevant phenomenon (AI hype and competitive pressure) and outline the key themes of the review (rebranding strategies, stakeholder perceptions, machinewashing).  \n- **Rebranding Strategies for AI Positioning** \u2013 Discuss how firms pivot their marketing and branding to incorporate AI. Describe common tactics (renaming products, highlighting AI capabilities in messaging) and motivations (capitalizing on AI\u2019s buzz to signal innovation). Cite evidence of this trend, including surveys showing many \u201cAI\u201d companies have little real AI\u301014\u2020L11-L15\u3011. Note short-term benefits (investor interest, media attention) as well as the risk of superficial changes.  \n- **Machinewashing and Ethical Concerns** \u2013 Introduce the concept of *\u201cmachinewashing\u201d* (by analogy to greenwashing) as per recent literature\u301011\u2020L7-L14\u3011. Define it as the practice of misleadingly marketing products as ethical or AI-driven, without substantive basis. Include forms it can take (misleading language, visuals, or even algorithmic gimmicks\u301011\u2020L7-L14\u3011). Relate this to the broader idea of \u201cAI-washing\u201d in industry (exaggerating AI claims\u301010\u2020L5-L9\u3011). Discuss why this is problematic ethically (stakeholder deception, reputational risk) and potential consequences (e.g. regulatory scrutiny\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011).  \n- **Stakeholder Perceptions and Reactions** \u2013 Examine how various stakeholders respond when companies reposition products as AI-driven. Break down perspectives: \n  - *Customers:* do AI claims increase perceived value or spark skepticism? Discuss trust issues (data privacy, algorithmic bias) and the need for transparency\u301010\u2020L19-L25\u3011\u301010\u2020L29-L31\u3011.  \n  - *Investors:* often enthusiastic about AI pivots, but hype can backfire if claims are unsubstantiated\u301010\u2020L25-L28\u3011. Mention cases like regulatory pushback on false AI claims hurting investor trust\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011.  \n  - *Employees:* internal stakeholders may feel uncertainty (job security, need for new skills) when firms suddenly \u201cgo AI.\u201d Note the importance of aligning such transformations with organizational culture (if covered in the literature).  \n- **Integration and Discussion** \u2013 Critically analyze how the sources converge or diverge. For instance, highlight the alignment between practitioner commentary on AI-washing\u301010\u2020L5-L9\u3011 and academic warnings about machinewashing\u301011\u2020L7-L14\u3011. Contrast optimistic views on AI\u2019s potential in marketing (e.g. increased adoption for personalization benefits) with critical views on misuse of AI as a buzzword. Discuss how stakeholder trust emerges as a common thread \u2013 misuse of AI in branding erodes trust, whereas authentic communication can build it\u301010\u2020L13-L18\u3011. Identify any gaps or future research needs noted by the literature (e.g. calls for frameworks to audit AI claims or for longitudinal studies on stakeholder trust post-rebranding).  \n- **Conclusion** \u2013 Summarize the key findings of the literature review. Emphasize that while repositioning products as AI-driven can be strategically beneficial, it must be backed by real capabilities and honesty. Underscore the dual importance of innovation and integrity: leveraging AI\u2019s power while avoiding \u201cmachinewashing\u201d pitfalls. Conclude with implications for managers (the need for transparency and stakeholder engagement when undergoing AI-related rebranding) and note how this issue will remain salient as AI technologies continue to proliferate.\n\n---\n\n# Pivoting to \u201cAI-Driven\u201d: Rebranding Strategies and Stakeholder Perceptions \u2013 A Literature Review\n\n## Introduction  \nOrganizations across industries are increasingly pivoting their marketing strategies to position products as \u201cAI-driven.\u201d With artificial intelligence becoming a focal point of technological innovation, many firms feel pressure to integrate AI or at least present themselves as doing so. Indeed, the adoption of AI in business has grown significantly in recent years\u30102\u2020L31-L34\u3011, and \u201cAI\u201d has become a powerful buzzword in marketing communications. Companies that once advertised \u201cdigital\u201d or \u201csmart\u201d capabilities are now rebranding products and services to emphasize AI, seeking to signal cutting-edge expertise and ride the wave of AI enthusiasm. This literature review examines how and why organizations undertake such AI-centric rebranding and the implications of this trend. We focus on three interrelated themes: (1) the rebranding strategies firms use to market offerings as AI-driven, (2) stakeholder perceptions and reactions to these AI-focused positioning efforts, and (3) the emerging concern of *\u201cmachinewashing\u201d* \u2013 i.e. misleadingly portraying products as AI-enabled or ethically AI-aligned. By synthesizing findings across recent studies and commentary, we develop a comprehensive view of the opportunities and risks in marketing products as \u201cAI-driven.\u201d The review is organized thematically, and all insights are drawn from the provided documents, with citations to those sources.\n\n## Rebranding Strategies for AI Positioning  \nA dominant theme in the literature is the array of **rebranding and repositioning strategies** that firms employ to associate themselves with AI. In the current business climate often dubbed an \u201cAI gold rush,\u201d organizations do not want to be left behind. They attempt to *signal innovation* by infusing AI into their brand identity \u2013 even when the underlying product has seen only incremental changes. Common tactics include renaming or renumbering products to highlight AI, updating slogans and mission statements with AI-centric language, and launching marketing campaigns that tout AI capabilities (e.g. \u201cpowered by artificial intelligence\u201d) in existing offerings.\n\nCrucially, the literature points out that many such pivots are **motivated by market perceptions**. Companies perceive that labeling a product \u201cAI-driven\u201d will enhance its value proposition in the eyes of customers and investors. By emphasizing AI, firms aim to convey improved efficiency, personalization, and innovation, hoping to differentiate from competitors. For example, even firms whose offerings already relied on algorithms (such as analytics software or automation tools) have rebranded those solutions as *AI* to make them appear more advanced. In some cases, entirely new company names or product lines are created to sound AI-focused \u2013 a recent case being a technology company rebranding itself from a generic name to *CreateAI* as it shifted focus to AI applications\u30107\u2020L25-L28\u3011. Such rebranding is seen as a way to rejuvenate a company\u2019s image and attract interest from the media and investors, who currently exhibit strong enthusiasm for anything AI-related.\n\nHowever, researchers also caution that **superficial or opportunistic rebranding** is widespread. A striking data point is that roughly *40% of self-proclaimed \u201cAI startups\u201d in Europe do not actually use AI in any tangible way*\u301014\u2020L7-L15\u3011. This finding by a venture capital study highlights that many firms appropriate the AI label without substantial justification, purely as a marketing strategy. In other words, some organizations are essentially *pivoting in name only* \u2013 capitalizing on the AI buzzword for \u201cwindow dressing.\u201d While this might yield short-term boosts (such as higher valuations or customer curiosity), it sets the stage for longer-term credibility issues. If customers or investors discover that an \u201cAI-driven\u201d product offers no real AI-based improvement, the firm\u2019s reputation can suffer. Thus, the literature implies that rebranding to be AI-focused is a double-edged sword: it can **enhance brand appeal** if done authentically, but it also raises expectations that must be met to avoid disillusionment\u301010\u2020L25-L28\u3011.\n\nIn summary, companies are actively reshaping their branding and marketing narratives to include AI, employing tactics from product renaming to AI-centric advertising. This strategic pivot is driven by the allure of AI\u2019s transformative image. Yet, as the next sections will explore, these moves are not without risk \u2013 prompting ethical questions and mixed reactions among key stakeholders.\n\n## Machinewashing and Ethical Concerns  \nAs firms rush to align themselves with AI, scholars and industry experts warn of a practice analogous to *greenwashing* \u2013 now termed **\u201cAI-washing\u201d or \u201cmachinewashing.\u201d** Machinewashing refers to the *misrepresentation or exaggeration of a product\u2019s AI capabilities or the ethical soundness of its AI*\u301011\u2020L7-L14\u3011. Seele and Schultz (2022) coin the term \u201cmachinewashing\u201d by reasoning in analogy to environmental greenwashing\u301015\u2020L11-L18\u3011. Just as greenwashing describes false or overstated claims about eco-friendliness, **machinewashing** describes misleading claims about artificial intelligence. Specifically, *\u201cmachinewashing involves misleading information about ethical AI communicated or omitted via words, visuals, or the underlying algorithm of AI itself.\u201d*\u301011\u2020L7-L14\u3011 In practice, this means an organization might **overhype its use of AI** (or its commitment to \u201cethical AI\u201d) through marketing communications and design, when in reality the product\u2019s AI is minimal or the ethical safeguards are lacking.\n\nThe literature identifies several ways in which machinewashing can manifest:  \n- **Misleading language in marketing (\u201cwords\u201d)** \u2013 e.g. using buzzwords like \u201cAI-powered\u201d or \u201cmachine learning\u2013driven\u201d for a product that is only using basic software logic. Companies may make broad claims about AI capabilities or imply human-like intelligence where none exists.  \n- **Deceptive visuals or branding (\u201cvisuals\u201d)** \u2013 e.g. employing images of robots, brain-like neural network graphics, or other AI symbolism in advertising to suggest a high-tech AI undercurrent. This can plant the idea that a product is more sophisticated than it truly is.  \n- **Superficial algorithm tweaks (\u201cunderlying algorithm\u201d)** \u2013 e.g. adding a simple algorithmic component and branding it as an AI feature, or selectively showcasing parts of an algorithm to appear \u201cethical by design.\u201d In some cases, firms might tout that their AI is \u201cfair\u201d or \u201ctransparent\u201d without evidence, thus *omitting* important information about biases or limitations.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, machinewashing is problematic because it **intentionally misleads stakeholders** about the nature of a product. One article in the business press bluntly defines AI-washing as a *\u201cmarketing strategy involving misleading and deceptive behavior, typically in the form of false or exaggerated claims about the use of AI.\u201d*\u301010\u2020L5-L9\u3011 These deceptive practices can erode trust and potentially harm consumers or clients who rely on the advertised capabilities. If a company overstates what its AI can do (for example, claiming an AI can make medical recommendations or investment decisions flawlessly), users could be put at risk by trusting those claims. Moreover, portraying an AI system as more \u201cethical\u201d or responsible than it truly is might lull stakeholders into a false sense of security, which is an ethical issue of **transparency and honesty**.\n\nThe analogy to greenwashing suggests that, over time, stakeholders may grow wary of AI-related claims if machinewashing becomes rampant. Just as consumers became skeptical of unsubstantiated \u201cgreen\u201d labels, they may treat *\u201cAI-driven\u201d* as mere hype without evidence. Recognizing this, some regulators have started to scrutinize AI marketing claims. A salient example highlighted in the literature is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) penalizing investment advisers for misleading claims of AI usage. The SEC emphasized that *\u201cInvestment advisers should not mislead the public by saying they are using an AI model when they are not. Such AI washing hurts investors.\u201d*\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011 This statement underscores the point that **AI-washing can have real consequences**: not only does it violate ethical norms, but it also undermines investor trust and can lead to legal penalties. \n\nIn summary, machinewashing is a cautionary concept that emerges from the intersection of marketing and ethics. It highlights the darker side of the AI-rebranding trend, wherein organizations might cross the line from enthusiastic marketing into deception. The literature consistently warns that while it is tempting to advertise products as \u201cAI-driven\u201d to capitalize on the hype, doing so without integrity \u2013 without real AI substance or with false assurances of ethicality \u2013 can damage credibility. The next section will delve into how various stakeholders perceive and react to these dynamics, further emphasizing why authenticity in AI marketing is critical.\n\n## Stakeholder Perceptions and Reactions  \nHow do stakeholders respond when an organization pivots its strategy to present a product as AI-driven? The literature suggests that reactions are mixed and depend on whether the AI positioning is seen as credible and beneficial, or as mere hype. Key stakeholder groups \u2013 customers, investors, and employees \u2013 each have distinct perspectives, which organizations must carefully manage during an AI-focused rebranding.\n\n- **Customer Trust and Acceptance:** From the customer or end-user standpoint, an AI-driven value proposition can be appealing: for instance, consumers might expect greater personalization, smarter features, or improved performance thanks to AI. However, trust is a **crucial currency** in this equation. Customers are increasingly aware of AI\u2019s pitfalls (such as data privacy issues, algorithmic bias, or opaque decision-making). As one report notes, *\u201cOne ingredient essential to unlocking the value of AI is trust. Customers need to trust that their personal data will not be misused.\u201d*\u301010\u2020L19-L25\u3011 If a company markets a product as AI-powered, customers will scrutinize how that AI behaves \u2013 Is it secure? Is it fair? Thus, a firm\u2019s credibility can be bolstered if the AI element genuinely improves the user experience and is implemented transparently. Conversely, if the AI label feels superficial, customers may become skeptical. Surveys indicate that a majority of people approach AI with caution; for example, a 2023 survey found *61% of respondents are wary of trusting AI systems*\u301010\u2020L29-L31\u3011. This wariness implies that companies must do more than simply slap \u201cAI\u201d on their product \u2013 they must **demonstrate reliability and transparency** to earn user acceptance. A failure to meet expectations (for instance, an \u201cAI\u201d feature that performs poorly or behaves unpredictably) can quickly lead to customer backlash and reputational damage. Indeed, the phenomenon of machinewashing discussed earlier directly undermines customer trust: once customers catch on that a claim was overstated, it becomes harder for that company (or even others in the industry) to win trust for legitimate AI features.\n\n- **Investor and Market Reactions:** Investors and market analysts are another critical audience for AI rebranding efforts. During the current AI boom, investors often reward companies that pivot to AI with increased interest and higher valuations \u2013 but only so long as the claims are believable. The literature notes that we have witnessed **stock market frenzies** when companies announce AI initiatives, reflecting a belief that AI capabilities drive future growth. However, this enthusiasm is tightly coupled with *hype risk*. If a company\u2019s AI narrative is revealed as overstated or unsubstantiated, the trust of investors can evaporate quickly\u301010\u2020L25-L28\u3011. Regulatory actions like the SEC\u2019s clampdown on \u201cAI washing\u201d in finance underscore that misleading investors is a serious offense\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011. In that SEC case, the advisers had touted AI-driven investment algorithms that did not exist, leading to sanctions \u2013 and likely a loss of credibility with clients. Thus, while investors are keen to see firms leverage AI, they also expect honesty and real technical competence. Corporate leaders need to manage this by providing evidence of AI capabilities (patents, demos, performance metrics) and by being candid about what is and isn\u2019t AI-driven in their offerings. A genuine AI-driven pivot can certainly draw investor support, but a cynical \u201cpaint it AI\u201d approach risks long-term investor skepticism and devaluation once the truth comes out.\n\n- **Employees and Internal Stakeholders:** An often less-discussed aspect in the literature, but nonetheless important, is how internal stakeholders (such as employees) perceive the organization\u2019s AI-focused transformation. Employees are stakeholders in the company\u2019s mission and can be directly impacted by AI initiatives (through changes in work processes or even job security concerns). If a company suddenly pivots a product to be \u201cAI-driven,\u201d employees must acquire new skills or adapt to new workflows, and they may worry about the implication of AI on their roles. The success of an AI rebranding thus also hinges on internal buy-in. Managers need to communicate the purpose of the AI strategy clearly to their teams to prevent fear and resistance. If the AI drive is merely marketing spin, employees might become cynical, which can hurt morale and execution. On the other hand, if employees see the company genuinely investing in AI development (e.g. training staff, hiring data scientists, building new AI features), they are more likely to support the new direction. Although specific studies on employee perspectives were not highlighted in the provided documents, stakeholder theory reminds us that neglecting internal stakeholder perceptions can undermine strategic change. In sum, an AI repositioning must be credible internally as well, so that employees become advocates rather than skeptics of the new \u201cAI-driven\u201d brand message.\n\nIn general, stakeholders reward authenticity and substance in AI-driven initiatives, and they penalize those seen as hollow hype. The literature consistently shows that **transparency and proof** of AI capabilities are key to positive stakeholder reception. For customers, this might mean explanatory content about how the AI works and what data it uses; for investors, this means disclosing enough technical detail and results to back up AI claims; for employees, this means involvement and training in the AI rollout. By contrast, a strategy heavy on buzzwords and light on specifics tends to breed skepticism across these groups. This underscores a central takeaway: successful marketing of AI-driven products requires aligning stakeholder expectations with reality, which in turn demands truthfulness and engagement rather than just glamorous rebranding.\n\n## Integration of Insights and Future Directions  \nPulling together these thematic findings, we see a clear narrative forming in the literature: **the push to market products as AI-driven is a double-edged sword, creating a tension between hype and credibility.** On one side, many authors highlight the enormous potential of AI in organizations \u2013 improved decision-making, efficiency gains, and new customer experiences \u2013 which justifies why firms are eager to adopt and promote AI\u30102\u2020L31-L34\u3011. On the other side, there is a growing body of work cautioning against the *overuse or misuse of the AI label*. The concept of machinewashing\u301011\u2020L7-L14\u3011, for instance, serves as a direct warning that exaggerating AI capabilities can be as damaging in the long run as the behavior it is analogized to (greenwashing) has been in the environmental domain.\n\nWhat becomes evident is that **multiple sources from different domains (ethics, marketing, stakeholder management) converge on the importance of authenticity**. Marketing practitioners writing about \u201cAI-washing\u201d stress that honesty is the best policy to avoid customer backlash\u301010\u2020L5-L9\u3011. Academic thinkers in business ethics (e.g. Seele & Schultz, 2022) systematically analyze how misleading AI claims erode societal trust\u301011\u2020L7-L14\u3011. Regulatory and legal perspectives, as shown by the SEC\u2019s statements, also reinforce that there are tangible penalties for straying into deception\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011. Thus, there is a broad consensus that while AI offers exciting opportunities, *misrepresenting AI in marketing is a significant risk.* \n\nWe also observe some **nuanced differences** or areas of emphasis across the literature. For example, the practitioner literature often focuses on *reputation and brand risk*. Articles aimed at marketers note that being caught \u201cAI-washing\u201d can quickly damage a brand\u2019s image, especially in the age of social media where consumer pushback can go viral. The academic literature, meanwhile, tends to frame machinewashing in terms of *ethical responsibility and stakeholder trust*, embedding the issue in theories of corporate social responsibility and business ethics. Despite the different framing, these perspectives are complementary: a loss of stakeholder trust (academic viewpoint) is essentially what tarnishes brand equity (practitioner viewpoint). Both imply that **transparency** is the remedy. Indeed, one source advises companies to *\u201calign AI disclosure with brand strategy\u201d* and practice openness about how AI is used, as a means to *\u201cbuild trust\u201d* with stakeholders\u301010\u2020L13-L18\u3011. This kind of recommendation illustrates a prescriptive takeaway that spans disciplines: candor about AI \u2013 its capabilities, its limitations, and its impacts \u2013 should be at the heart of any AI-driven rebranding effort.\n\nAnother insight is how this AI rebranding phenomenon fits into larger patterns of business hype cycles and stakeholder reactions. Several authors draw parallels with prior trends (such as big data, blockchain, or cloud computing) where similar waves of rebranding occurred. The difference with AI, however, is the heightened level of public scrutiny and ethical debate surrounding it. This makes stakeholder perceptions even more crucial. The literature suggests that stakeholders today are more informed and vigilant; hence, they are quick to call out discrepancies between a company\u2019s AI claims and reality. The risk of **cynicism** looms if the market becomes saturated with inflated AI claims. Such cynicism can spill over and hurt even well-intentioned companies \u2013 a kind of \u201creputation spillover\u201d effect where trust in AI as a whole diminishes. This concern is precisely why researchers like Seele & Schultz (2022) call for further examination of machinewashing and how to prevent it\u301015\u2020L11-L18\u3011. They and others propose that future research should develop frameworks to identify and categorize AI-washing practices, measure their impact on stakeholder trust, and devise governance mechanisms to ensure more truthful AI communications. For instance, analogous to environmental reporting standards that curbed greenwashing, we may see calls for **\u201cAI transparency standards\u201d** or independent audits of AI claims in the future.\n\nMoreover, bridging the gap between promise and practice is identified as a key future challenge. Some sources implicitly question: *How can organizations effectively integrate AI so that their marketing claims are not empty?* This hints at an important point \u2013 the **solution to AI-washing is not to avoid AI branding altogether, but to invest in genuine AI capabilities and ethical practices**. By actually developing robust AI features and rigorously testing them for fairness, accuracy, and security, firms can confidently market their products as AI-driven without fear of backlash. In other words, the literature suggests aligning the internal reality with the external messaging. This alignment will likely be a focus of future case studies and empirical research, examining firms that successfully navigated an AI-oriented transformation versus those that failed due to hype. \n\nIn summary, the integrated view from the literature is that positioning products as AI-driven is a trend that is here to stay, but it must evolve from **hype to honesty**. Multiple scholarly and practical perspectives reinforce the same message: stakeholder trust is hard won and easily lost in the era of AI. Going forward, research and managerial practice will need to address how to communicate AI innovations responsibly. This includes developing guidelines for ethical AI marketing, educating stakeholders (customers, employees, investors) about what AI truly entails in each context, and creating accountability for AI-related claims.\n\n## Conclusion  \nThis literature review has examined how organizations pivot their marketing strategies to cast products as \u201cAI-driven,\u201d and what implications arise from this repositioning. The reviewed sources collectively paint a picture of a high-stakes balancing act. On one hand, embracing AI in branding can yield significant advantages \u2013 it signals modernity, attracts investment, and can enhance customer perceptions if the AI delivers real improvements. On the other hand, the **perils of superficial or misleading AI rebranding are substantial**. The concept of machinewashing serves as a stark reminder that deceptive marketing of AI, whether through exaggerated claims or ethical posturing, can backfire severely\u301011\u2020L7-L14\u3011. Stakeholders across the spectrum \u2013 from savvy customers to watchful regulators \u2013 are attuned to authenticity, and they react negatively when a company\u2019s rhetoric outpaces its reality. \n\nFor managers and organizations, the key takeaway is the importance of **aligning AI narratives with actual capabilities**. If a firm chooses to label a product as AI-driven, it must invest the effort to ensure that product truly leverages AI in a meaningful way and that any ethical implications (privacy, fairness, transparency) are responsibly addressed. Effective communication is critical here: rather than hype, companies should aim for clarity about what their AI does. By being transparent and educating users, firms can foster trust and enthusiasm simultaneously. As the literature noted, trust is essential to realizing AI\u2019s benefits\u301010\u2020L19-L25\u3011 \u2013 without trust, even the most advanced AI feature may be met with resistance or doubt.\n\nIn concluding, it is evident that **\u201cAI-driven\u201d cannot merely be a marketing slogan; it needs to be a verifiable attribute of the product and the organization\u2019s practices.** The current era offers a cautionary parallel to the age of greenwashing \u2013 those who engage in AI-washing may gain in the short term but will likely suffer reputational damage as stakeholders become more discerning\u301016\u2020L1-L7\u3011. Conversely, organizations that marry innovation with integrity stand to build enduring trust and capture the true value that AI can provide. The scholarship and cases reviewed here suggest that sustainable success in the AI-driven world will come to those who treat AI not just as a trendy label, but as a core capability developed honestly and communicated transparently. This alignment of substance and messaging will help ensure that \u201cAI-driven\u201d branding is not just hype, but a promise delivered. \n\nOverall, positioning products as AI-driven is a strategy that must be pursued thoughtfully. The literature invites leaders to approach it with a mix of optimism and caution \u2013 **optimism** about AI\u2019s transformative potential, and **caution** to avoid the traps of machinewashing.
