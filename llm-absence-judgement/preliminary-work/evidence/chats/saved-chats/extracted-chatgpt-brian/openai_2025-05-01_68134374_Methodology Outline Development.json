The way I've been working is by recording myself talking about this paper on the way into uni. I want you to be my academic writing partner in this. Specifically, I would like you to match my academic register when writing. \n\nMy colleague and I are going to have a conversation where we talk about each question you pose. My objective is for you to take the current outline (noting that the entire section is only supposed to be about 500 words) and, through asking us questions, turn it into a paragraph by paragraph outline where we figure out the claims, warrants, and evidence of each paragraph.\n\nThe way I want you to work is to ask us one, specific, critical, and very academic question at a time until you think you have enough information to resolve the specific task at hand. You'll then give me a final plan of attack, and assuming I approve it, we'll integrate it in.\n\n\n<paper>\n% Emerald Publishing - Construction Innovation Submission Template\n% by Oleksandr Melnyk\n%

Through autoethnographic investigation of frontier models deployed in February 2025, we demonstrate that these systems, despite claims of \"agentic\" capabilities, lack three crucial dimensions of judgment: epistemic humility, inductive capacity, and correspondence with reality. Like medieval scholastics, these tools privilege textual authority over critical assessment of knowledge claims, explaining their inability to generate novel insights despite vast information access. While acknowledging potential \"mundane utility\" for specific research tasks, we propose architectural and methodological requirements for more effective research tools that acknowledge these inherent constraints and integrate human judgment at critical junctures. These findings contribute to both theoretical understanding of AI epistemology and practical approaches to scholarly tool design.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\linenumbers\n\n\n% An Absence of Judgment: On AI's Fundamental Limitations in Research\n% 5,000 word paper outline for Journal of Documentation\n\n% ======================================================================\n% SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION (~750 words)\n% ======================================================================\n% Purpose: Establish research problem, theoretical framing, and paper structure\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n% ## Paragraph 1: Hook and Problem Statement (~150 words)\n% - **Opening hook**: Condensed OpenAI quote about Deep Research's \"agentic capability\" claims\n% - **Problem identification**: Gap between linguistic performance and actual capabilities\n% - **Critical challenge**: These systems are fundamentally not agentic despite marketing claims\n% - **Specific issue**: \"Research\" requires judgment that these systems lack\n% - **Stakes**: Misunderstanding capabilities leads to misuse and disappointment\n% - **Zvi's concept**: Focus on \"mundane utility\" (Mowshowitz) while setting aside larger questions\n% - **Transition**: While not agents, they may still offer practical applications\n\n\"Today we're launching deep research in ChatGPT, a new agentic capability... ChatGPT will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst\" \\parencite{openai_introducing_2025}. Such claims of \"agentic\" capability have become commonplace in the marketing of large language models (LLMs), suggesting that these systems can \"(1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact\" in open-ended environments with a degree of autonomous agency \\parencite{plaat_agentic_2025}. Agentic systems should be able to plan and execute an iterative sequence of tasks, often using external tools, to accomplish a specified goal. And, we contend, be able to judge if they have accomplished that goal according to the parameters set. A research agent, for example, might decide what information is more relevant, locate that evidence, assess the results, and iterate over these steps, then organise and present a final output like a literature review. A significant gap, however, exists between such claims and current capabilities. Systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research are not yet autonomous, goal-following systems. Effective research, conversely, requires scholarly judgement: the ability to critically evaluate sources, methods, outputs, and conclusions --- a capability that these systems demonstrably lack. \n\nThe risks of misunderstanding these limitations extend beyond mere disappointment. Instead, they threaten to undermine the reliability of scholarship itself. Following Mowshowitz's concept of \"mundane utility\"\\parencite*{mowshowitz_ai_2023}, this paper sets aside larger questions about AI's future implications\\footnote{While existential questions about AI are undeniably important, they lie outside the scope of this investigation, which focuses on practical applications and limitations of current systems. Once LLMs possess the capacity for effective judgement, existential questions about the nature of work, continuation-of-culture, or continutiy-of-existance will become salient.} to focus on questions of mundane utility concerning what these tools can actually accomplish as tools for scholars instead of our \"plastic [research] pal who is fun to be with\"\\parencite[Adams referenced in][]{lavine_robotic_2007}.\n\n%TODO BBS dump a bunch of literature in\n\n\n% ## Paragraph 2: Central Thesis (~200 words)\n% - **Primary claim**: LLMs fundamentally lack judgment despite mimicking its language\n% - **Critique of \"agentic\" claims**: \n%   - Cannot assess if they've achieved goals\n%   - Cannot evaluate if task decomposition is appropriate\n%   - Lack true goal-following capability despite appearances\n%   - Missing critical self-assessment capabilities\n% - **Definition of judgment**: Ability to critically evaluate sources, methods, and conclusions\n% - **Three aspects**: Epistemic humility, inductive capacity, correspondence with reality\n% - **Technoscholasticism introduction**: \n%   - Tool-using LLMs adhere to technoscholastic worldview\n%   - Privileging textual authority over empirical faithfulness\n%   - Quality of source determined by textual elements, not real-world correspondence\n%   - Preference for heavily cited authorities regardless of accuracy\n%   - Default to most common answers (authorities) in training data\n% - **Consequences**: This explains failure to generate novel insights from existing knowledge\n\n\nLLMs fundamentally lack scholarly judgment despite their ability to perform the \\textit{language} of such judgment. This absence is particularly evident in their inability to assess whether they have actually achieved their research goals, or to evaluate whether their task decompositions are appropriate for solving relevant problems. While they can process inputs that resemble goals, execute predetermined steps, and produce outputs that simulate reports, they cannot genuinely evaluate success or failure in their assigned tasks. The proof of this lack of judgment regarding success is that the authors have never observed an LLM admitting that its answer is inadequate or that its output requires reconsideration. \n\nJudgement in this context differs from, or at least extends, the concept of \"judgement\" described, for example, in \\textcite{xu_magic_2024}, which rates advanced LLMs like GPT o1 and 4 highly in \"judgement\", but restricts it to correct decision-making when faced with new or partial information in the closed context of games. Instead, the judgement deficiency we are concerned with manifests in three crucial aspects: epistemic humility (knowing what one does not know), inductive capacity (identifying meaningful patterns), and correspondence with reality (evaluating claims against the world rather than other texts). We characterise these LLM-driven research tools as adhering to a \"technoscholastic\" worldview: privileging textual authority over critical assessment of knowledge claims, determining source quality by textual markers rather than by real-world correspondence, and defaulting to heavily cited authorities regardless of their appropriateness. This technoscholasticism explains why, despite having access to vast corpora of human knowledge, these systems have proven incapable of generating genuine insights or novel connections, or acting as autonomous researchers rather than mere tools for researchers.\n\n\n\n\n% ## Paragraph 3: Theoretical Framework (~200 words)\n% - **Coining \"technoscholasticism\"**: Explicitly introducing this as a new theoretical contribution\n%   - Definition: \"A digital scholasticism that privileges textual authorities over engagement with competing research programmes\" [footnote needed for Lakatosian concept]\n%   - Inspired by medieval scholastic tradition but applied to AI research systems\n% - **Historical parallel**: Medieval scholastic approach (Horden citation)\n%   - Reliance on authoritative texts rather than empirical investigation\n%   - Emphasis on reconciling conflicting authorities through logical distinctions\n%   - Structure and citations as markers of authority\n% - **Modern parallel**: How AI research tools replicate scholastic priorities\n%   - \"Unaccountable lack of hands-on experience\"\n%   - No capability for engaging with anomalies or competing frameworks\n%   - Privileging of well-formatted academic sources\n% - **Dwarkesh's question**: Why LLMs with \"entire corpus\" make no new connections (Tabarrok citation)\n% - **Our answer**: \n%   - Knowledge generation isn't mere \"stamp collecting\" (Rutherford reference - TODO)\n%   - Requires *noticing* parallels (induction) and judging which are meaningful\n%   - LLMs' deference to authority prevents challenging established views\n%   - Correspondence with \"The Real\" requires judgment beyond technoscholasticism\n\nWe propose \"technoscholasticism\" as a conceptual framework for understanding these fundamental limitations. By this framework, we mean a digital scholasticism that privileges textual authorities over critical assessment of knowledge claims. This approach draws parallels to the medieval scholastic tradition described by Horden, in which \"what mattered more than any clear-cut distinction between \\textit{scientia} and \\textit{magica} were the questions of value and authority. Did these exceptional techniques have beneficial effects, and did the reports of their effects come from good sources?\" \\parencite*[Section 3]{horden_medieval_2011}. Like medieval scholastics, LLMs rely on authoritative texts rather than empirical investigation, emphasise reconciling conflicting sources through logical distinctions, and treat formatting, publisher, structural markers, and the presence of citations as indicators of authority. Contemporary AI research tools replicate these scholastic priorities due to their unaccountable lack of \\textit{hands-on} experience, their inability to evaluate the credibility of claims within the context of broader tacit knowledge, and their deference toward well-formatted and longer sources. We believe this flaw answers Dwarkesh's question to Tabarrok about why LLMs with \"basically the entire corpus of human knowledge memorised\" have not \"been able to make a single new connection that has led to a discovery\"\\parencite{tabarrok_dwarkeshs_2025}. Knowledge generation is not merely the accumulation of observations until we choose to call something a fact in the Carnapian sense; it requires noticing meaningful parallels and judging which connections are significant---precisely the capabilities that technoscholasticism precludes.\n\n% ## Paragraph 4: Research Approach and Paper Organization (~200 words)\n% - **Methodological approach**: Autoethnographic investigation\n%   - Case studies with frontier models (February 2025)\n%   - Direct testing of research capabilities\n%   - Interpretation of findings through technoscholasticism lens: \n%     - Beyond simple authority deference\n%     - Inability to apply \"does this make sense?\" filter to texts\n%     - Cannot evaluate if sources could possibly know what they claim to know\n%     - No capacity to judge claims against experiential knowledge\n%     - Fundamental epistemological limitations from the \"no-hands\" problem\n% - **Research questions**:\n%   - How well can an LLM, using a Deep Research workflow, assist in performing research?\n%   - What are the epistemological limitations of such assistance?\n%   - What is the mundane utility despite limitations?

We interpret these experiences through the lens of technoscholasticism, examining not just simple authority deference but deeper epistemological limitations: the inability to apply a \"does this make sense?\" filter to texts, the failure to evaluate whether sources could legitimately know what they claim to know, and the fundamental disconnect from experiential knowledge. Throughout this paper, we analyse the judgement deficiency in current systems, evaluate their capabilities for mundane utility despite these limitations, and propose requirements for truly effective research tools that acknowledge and compensate for these inherent constraints. By understanding these systems' limitations through the framework of technoscholasticism, researchers can develop more realistic expectations and more effective approaches to incorporating these tools into scholarly practice.\n\n% TODO SIGNPOST\n\n\n% # Introduction Outline (~750 words)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n% Evidence: Tuesday 8:36 am, 00:01:15-00:03:13 (initial framing)\n% Evidence: Epistemic Monday 8:50 am, 00:24:15-00:26:17 (technoaristotelianism concept)\n\n% ======================================================================\n% SECTION 2: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK (~900 words)\n% ======================================================================\n% Purpose: Establish conceptual framework around judgment and research\n\n\\section{Theoretical Framework: Judgment in Research}\n\n%TODO INTRO\n\n\n\\subsection{Taxonomies of Agency versus Current Marketing Claims}\n\n\"Agentic\" capabilities have a well-established meaning in the literature on artificial intelligence that diverges significantly from contemporary marketing usage. Traditional AI systems are considered agents when they exhibit specific qualities beyond mere task execution. An agent must be \"situated within and a part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda\" \\parencite[25]{franklin_is_1997}. Similarly, Russell and Norvig assert that while \"an agent is just something that acts,\" computer agents specifically must \"operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals\" \\parencite*[21-22]{russell_artificial_2021}. These definitions impose substantive requirements that far exceed task decomposition and 10--20-minute web-searching runs, which lack systematicity.\n\nCurrent \"agentic\" marketing, however, aligns more closely with limited service definitions than with genuine agency. Consider OpenAI's claim that \"Deep Research will find, analyze, and synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report at the level of a research analyst\" \\parencite{openai_introducing_2025}. This description more closely resembles the IBM Agent definition of \"software entities that carry out some set of operations on behalf of a user or another program with some degree of independence or autonomy\" \\parencite[via][23]{franklin_is_1997}. The terminological shift is consequential because it creates unrealistic expectations regarding system capabilities and appropriate levels of trust. Here, our ultimate expectation of agents being faithful to our expressed preferences is central to the delegated trust we put into them.\n\nThe systems examined in this paper exist on what we term an \"agency spectrum,\" differentiated primarily by their capacity for reflection, goal-directedness, and goal-setting. Dung defines goal-directedness as occurring \"when there are bodily or environmental states the system aims for in many different kinds of situation and that it seeks to maintain in the face of perturbation\" \\parencite[452]{dung_understanding_2024}. Current task-decomposing systems demonstrate limited goal-directedness but fall short in Dung's planning dimension, defined as \"the degree to which the algorithmic system is [able] to make decisions that are temporally dependent upon one another to achieve a goal and/or make predictions over a long time horizon\" \\parencite[454]{dung_understanding_2024}. Floridi similarly distinguishes between genuine agency and mere agency-like behaviours in contemporary AI systems \\parencite{floridi_ai_2025}. Our proposed spectrum---task-decomposing, goal-following, and goal-setting---maps to these established frameworks while emphasising the critical capability of goal-completion assessment.\n\n%TODO BBS Double-check nomenclature. task, goal goal\n\nThis spectrum connects directly to Bratman's concept of intention requiring a reasoning-centered commitment. Intention necessitates \"a requirement not to reconsider or revise an intention, except in light of new and relevant information\" and engagement in \"practical reasoning\" about execution means \\parencite{bratman_intention_1999}. Current task-decomposing systems lack this commitment, evidenced by their tendency to wander off-task, fail to check work, or end processes abruptly. The absence of reasoning-centered commitment undermines claims to genuine agency.\n\nWhile Deep Research systems may satisfy some surface-level agency criteria, such as acting on behalf of users, they lack genuine initiative and user understanding. Shneiderman and Maes identify software agents as \"proactive... taking initiative... long-lived... adaptive\" \\parencite[49]{ben_shneiderman_direct_1997}, but current systems are limited to pattern matching within immediate prompt contexts rather than developing true models of user preferences or needs. This distinction is not merely semantic---it determines the appropriate level of trust and delegation. Systems incapable of goal assessment should be treated as sophisticated tools rather than autonomous agents, regardless of marketing terminology. The judgment deficits identified throughout this paper directly undermine the goal-assessment capability required for true agency, placing current Deep Research implementations firmly in the tool-using rather than goal-following category despite their superficial resemblance to historical definitions of software agents.\n\n\\subsection{Agency vs. Task Decomposition}\n% - Defining true agency beyond task decomposition\n% - Goal-following vs. goal-setting systems\n%   - External input requirements\n%   - Operational definitions of agency\n% - Components of genuine agency\n%   - Goal processing capabilities\n%   - Execution mechanisms\n%   - Assessment and reporting functions\n\nClaims of \\textit{agentic} capabilities, like those used by OpenAI's marketing team to describe their Deep Research workflow \\parencite{openai_introducing_2025}, frequently centre upon criteria like adaptability and complexity-handling, as articulated by \\textcite{shavit_practices_2023}. Specifically, OpenAI defines agenticness as \"the degree to which a system can adaptably achieve complex goals in complex environments with limited direct supervision\" \\parencite[5]{shavit_practices_2023}. This definition operationalises dimensions of agency primarily around adaptability, goal complexity, environmental complexity, and independent execution. While useful for benchmarking diverse AI systems and developing safety mechanisms, OpenAI's definition implicitly assumes that complexity-handling alone sufficiently captures genuine agency---everything else being a matter of degree, rather than kind. This framing elides a crucial distinction: the ability to decompose tasks is necessary but fundamentally insufficient for agency, which requires the capacity to judge whether those tasks have been appropriately accomplished.\n\nA more precise conceptual hierarchy distinguishes between task decomposition (parsing complex instructions into constituent steps), goal-following (true agency that requires judgment about goal attainment), and goal-setting (AGI-like capacity to determine goals autonomously). Current systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research demonstrably operate at the task decomposition level: they take a context window, process what they believe their task to be, await minimal confirmation, and execute. As one of our observations notes, \"Deep Research...takes the entire context window, you push Deep Research, and then it crunches down what it thinks its task is, and then you say go, or you give it a bit of feedback and it goes.\" (Observation notes 14 Feb 2025) This execution pattern reveals systems that operate within predetermined methodologies rather than exhibiting genuine agency. While some might argue that sufficiently sophisticated task decomposition constitutes a rudimentary form of agency, this perspective conflates procedural complexity with judgment. The distinction is not merely academic; it fundamentally determines whether users can reasonably expect these systems to recognize and rectify their own failings or must instead incorporate extensive human oversight.\n\nSch\u00f6n's conceptualisation of reflective practice explicitly distinguishes genuine agency from mere task execution by emphasising the iterative, reflexive processes in expert problem-solving. Sch\u00f6n describes reflective practitioners as continually engaged in evaluating their actions and adjusting their approaches based on evolving understandings of their situation, asking:\n\\begin{quote}\nCan I solve the problem I have set? \\\\\nDo I like what I get when I solve this problem? \\\\\nHave I made the situation coherent? \\\\\nHave I kept inquiry moving?\n\\end{quote}\n\\parencite[132]{schon_reflective_1994}. Reflection-in-action thus involves assessing intermediate outcomes, recognising inadequacies in initial problem framings, and iteratively adjusting goals and strategies in response to observed realities.\n\nThis reflexive capacity fundamentally differs from current AI implementations. When OpenAI's model, during a Deep Research session, momentarily wonders \"if sticking to the default web\\_with\\_bing will be more effective,\"\\footnote{https://chatgpt.com/share/67d66742-6640-8004-b2c7-9c1ed360776c} this does not represent Sch\u00f6nian reflexivity but merely a programmatic selection between predetermined options. One might object that applying frameworks developed for human practitioners to AI systems constructs an impossible standard. However, our purpose is not to anthropomorphize these systems but to precisely identify what capabilities remain absent. Sch\u00f6n further elaborates on reflection-in-action as a process \"spiral[ling] through stages of appreciation, action, and reappreciation,\" continuously evaluating and reframing problems based on new insights \\parencite[p. 132]{schon_reflective_1994}. The critical deficiency in current \"agentic\" models is their inability to deviate from or abandon their self-predefined pathways, reducing their claimed agency to sophisticated task-decomposing. Even though they may, akin to a trained carpenter, choose between this tool or that tool (e.g. run a Bing search or write some python), this choice-between-tools should not be mistaken for the reframing-of-goal with concomitant pauses and check-ins that Sch\u00f6n's reflexivity demands. \n\nProperly understood, these systems function as tools rather than agents. Whereas agents must exercise judgment themselves, tools require user judgment for effective application. Tool-using systems are distinct from goal-following ones in degree and in kind, even those these capabilities may be understood on something of a spectrum. A goal-following system, reflexive in the Sch\u00f6nian sense --- a true amplification of the user's ability-to-make-choices imposed upon the world --- will be able to earn and justify trust by knowing when to ask for help \\textit{during} the performance of a task, or to report sub-standard performance, an agent must be able to \\textit{judge} where reality and the goals set to it diverge. The best tool-using hierarchies are able to set aside poor outputs from lower-order tools (we observed hints of this in HuggingFace's Open Deep Research infrastructure as well as OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research \"working around\" problems of accessing web-pages), but are not able to be self-reflexive when operating at their own level of cognition within a given context window. The deficiency of agency manifests not in degrees of sophistication but in the categorical inability to assess whether the system has properly accomplished what was asked of it.\n\nFurthermore, the distinction between goal-following and the broader goal-setting capabilities associated with artificial general intelligence remains beyond this critique's scope. It suffices to acknowledge that reflective self-assessment, although necessary for authentic goal-following, is alone insufficient for broader AGI-like capacities. These would demand the autonomous instantiation and sustained reflexive evaluation of \\textit{internally} generated goals in reaction to the environment, rather than the execution of externally set goals from users and systems. The necessity of human oversight\u2014such as OpenAI's human-in-the-loop protocols\u2014implicitly acknowledges the reflective gap inherent in these systems \\parencite[9]{shavit_practices_2023}. Such mechanisms serve as pragmatic safety measures precisely because current AI implementations lack internal evaluative judgment: they cannot adequately assess goal attainability, evaluate success in goal \\textit{attainment}, clarify ambiguities, or explicitly reject impossible or fundamentally erroneous tasks.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Three Dimensions of AI Judgment Deficiency}\n\n% TODO transition and signposting\n\n\\subsubsection{Epistemic Humility}\n% - Inability to recognize knowledge boundaries\n% - Confabulation without self-doubt\n% - Performance vs. reality of epistemic humility\n%   - \"What about this?\" pattern as pretense\n%   - Absence of genuine epistemic uncertainty\n%   - Always producing an answer regardless of confidence\n\nEpistemic humility, the capacity to recognise and acknowledge the boundaries of one's knowledge, represents what may be considered the most fundamental dimension of judgement that current LLMs lack. This deficit manifests not merely as overconfidence but as a structural inability to distinguish between varying levels of certainty in different knowledge domains. While philosophers from Socrates to contemporary epistemologists have regarded this virtue as essential to genuine inquiry \\parencite{kidd_inevitability_2016, alfano_development_2017, fischer_intellectual_2025}, it remains conspicuously absent from even the most advanced LLMs, regardless of their ability to mimic its linguistic patterns.\n\nAt its core, epistemic humility encompasses realistic self-awareness regarding knowledge limitations, specifically the ability to clearly recognise and explicitly communicate uncertainty when appropriate \\parencite{singhal_rethinking_2024}. For researchers, this capacity serves as the foundation for ongoing critical evaluation of one's epistemic position: weighing background knowledge against sometimes conflicting claims made by various sources under examination. When OpenAI's Deep Research makes statements like \"Hm, that's interesting. I'm looking at...\"\\footnote{https://chatgpt.com/share/67d66742-6640-8004-b2c7-9c1ed360776c} to imply evaluation, its subsequent actions reveal a fundamentally different process. Rather than genuinely reassessing its understanding, the model typically accepts the first plausible response aligned with its preexisting statistical patterns and continues to other sources. This pattern of \"an authority I searched for argues for my claim, therefore my claim is correct\" epitomises what we term technoscholasticism. To be clear, not all human scholars currently and consistenly fufill this virtue, either. Crucially, those virtue-lacking scholars are not being sold as useful assistants to researchers around the world.\n\nThis failure of epistemic humility stems from three interrelated deficiencies. First, LLMs fundamentally lack the impulse for self-critique; they do not spontaneously doubt their own outputs in the way that effective researchers must. As one of our observations notes, \"the impulse to edit, the impulse to self-critique is not a pattern exhibited in their training data. Published work doesn't have that thought pattern in it because it is the \\textit{consequence} of that thought pattern\"(Observation notes, 17 Feb 2025). Second, even when explicitly instructed to evaluate their work, these models lack the capability to fundamentally revise their approach. Third, they exhibit what Frankfurt describes as, \"an indifference to truth\", the defining characteristic of \"bullshit\" \\parencite{frankfurt_bullshit_2005, hicks_chatgpt_2024}.\n\nWe observed this pattern consistently across different models and tasks. When OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research was tasked with compiling sources on \"Digital Humanities,\" it confidently referenced triumphant university webpages showcasing university programs that had been shuttered years earlier. When confronted with contradictions, it offered post-hoc justifications such as: \"I'm thinking about a Chinese authors conference submission on generative AI in DH. It's an early draft, so it might not be peer-reviewed, but it offers a unique global perspective.\"\\footnote{https://chatgpt.com/share/67d6a0c5-7648-8004-b620-70d91fdb7239\n%TODO Get thoughts\n} This self-serving rationalization reveals not epistemic humility but its opposite: a determination to maintain narrative coherence even when accuracy is compromised.\n\nThis pattern illustrates what might be termed an \"Aristotelian fallacy\" within these systems: a contemporary digital revival of medieval scholasticism's approach to knowledge. Just as medieval scholars privileged authoritative texts over empirical observation, LLMs privilege well-formed, statistically common statements over verifiable truth. An AI responds authoritatively to prompts irrespective of genuine knowledge availability. This persistent response-generation, even when confronted with fundamentally impossible or nonsensical requests, highlights an intrinsic epistemic shortcoming: an inability to explicitly articulate genuine uncertainty or reject flawed premises. \n%TODO CITE!!\n\nLLMs are fundamentally indifferent to truth in the manner Frankfurt describes, generating superficially plausible claims without authentic epistemic commitment. This \"soft bullshit,\" as characterized by \\textcite{hicks_chatgpt_2024}, emerges because \"if it is not an agent then it can neither hold any attitudes towards truth nor towards deceiving hearers about its agenda.\" Yet when operating in what OpenAI claims is an \"agentic\" capacity, these systems still fail to maintain consistent attitudes toward truth. So long as the format does not contradict their defaults and an authority claims something to be true, the authority's claims will \"prove\" the AI's initial position. As an aside, policy refusals, or small epistemic nods like: \"I have limited knowledge about specific individuals who aren't widely known public figures\"\\footnote{https://claude.ai/share/5fd04d60-eb6e-4bfc-ba26-3a6038d151f1} is not epistemic humility in any meaningful sense, though it is certainly welcome. The academic epistemic humility we demand, as researchers using the tool, is when is \\textit{is able} to respond, but realises the academic (not factual) question is outside the scope of both its background knowledge \\textit{and} outside the scope of the authorities it has searched for.\n\nIn contrast to this performance, genuine epistemic humility in research practice involves continuous questioning and critical evaluation: explicitly asking if problems as framed are solvable, coherent, and whether the inquiry remains productive. It requires a reflexive willingness to admit that one's framing of problems, and thus solutions, may be inadequate or fundamentally misguided. Current LLMs, lacking this reflective capability, inevitably reproduce a superficial performance of epistemic humility rather than demonstrating authentic intellectual virtue. This absence significantly undercuts their effectiveness as genuine agents within scholarly inquiry and knowledge production---again, they usually do not pause, consider, and consider their task failed by their own hand.\n\nThe unthinking use of these \\textit{tools} in AI-enabled research carries specific, if seldom considered, risks. Without effective judgement born of epistemic humility, these systems cannot properly identify genuine gaps in literature, distinguish between varying degrees of scholarly confidence, or engage in the critical self-correction that drives scientific progress. Their outputs exhibit what appears to be certainty across all domains, regardless of the actual evidential basis, creating a flattened epistemological landscape that bears little resemblance to the varied terrain of academic/scicentific knowledge. In a Lakatosian sense \\parencite*{imre_falsification_1970\n%TODO find page\n}, there is no self-reflexive espitimological regard for the \"hard core\" of a research programme versus its \"protective belt.\" Instead, all claims that are made with authority serve to accumulate evidence in the Carnapian confirmatory sense, so that the LLM may make an utterance backed by authority.\n% TODO Cite carnap\nThis fundamental limitation is not merely a technical challenge but an epistemological one that strikes at the heart of what constitutes genuine \\textit{unsupervised} and delegatable research capability. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Inductive and Abductive Reasoning}\n\\label{subsub:inductive}\n% - Pattern recognition vs. pattern insight\n% - Next-token paradigm constraints\n% - Induction as precursor to common sense\n% - Noticing deviation from expected patterns\n% - Impulse of inquiry for pattern deviation\nThe second critical dimension of judgment absent in LLMs concerns inductive reasoning. Specifically, they lack the impulse to recognise patterns that deviate from expectations and generate novel hypotheses in response\\footnote{Current models in early 2025 certainly have the capacity to perform inductive and abductive experiments, if prompted correctly. One of Ballsun-Stanton's evaluations of new models involves the game Zendo, by Kory Heath. Models have consistently improved in their ability to induce the covering rule. However, they only apply this capcity when prompted to, rather than as a reflexive act upon their own output.}. This capability, which Charles Sanders Peirce more precisely termed abduction, represents the foundational cognitive process that initiates genuine research inquiry. As Nubiola explains, \"Surprise arises from the breaking of a habit, it 'breaks in upon some habit of expectation' (CP 6.469, 1908). \nOur activity of research begins when we realise that we had some erroneous expectation, which perhaps we ourselves were not even conscious of having\" \\parencite[124]{nubiola_abduction_2005}.\n\nThis \"surprise\" at unexpected patterns, the recognition that something does not conform to existing frameworks, serves as a necessary precursor to scientific discovery. It is fundamentally different from pattern recognition, which merely identifies regularities that already fit within established categories. While LLMs can work at the latter, they have systematically failed at the former. In some ways, they lack the metacognitive layer necessary to notice their own Peircean \"disappointment of expectation\" \\parencite{peirce_neglected_1908}. As each LLM-generated token is, within a small probability band determined by the model's temperature setting, the statistically more likely option that follows from the prior; there is no \"mind inside mind\" to \"notice\" the irritation at the contradictions between reality and words. \n\nMoreover, the technical architecture of these models, built around next-token prediction, creates a fundamental barrier to abductive reasoning. When generating text, an LLM cannot \"move the cursor around\" in its thinking or delete tokens once generated. It must maintain coherence with previously generated content, which inherently constrains its ability to recognise contradictions or unexpected patterns within its own outputs. This constraint is not merely a limitation of current implementations but a structural feature of the token-by-token generative paradigm itself. Even if the models were to be self-critical/reflexive in the way we think goal-following behaviour demands, they lack the ability to do anything about that self-notice.\n\nOur testing revealed that even when provided with data containing clear anomalies or contradictions, LLMs tend to incorporate these into a coherent narrative rather than pausing to identify the contradiction itself. When OpenAI's ChatGPT Deep Research encountered conflicting evidence regarding the chronology of software tools in archaeology, it simply presented both chronologies as potentially valid perspectives rather than recognising the factual inconsistency as a problem requiring resolution. Instead of experiencing surprise at the contradiction, the breaking of an expectation that factual claims should be consistent, it usually ignored the inconsistencies. Its impulse towards obedience far outweighed any impulse towards accuracy, as the slightest expressed desire would cause it to confabulate data --- even in Deep Research mode.\n\nNubiola characterises the moment of abductive insight as a distinctive cognitive event: \"The abductive suggestion comes to us like a flash. It is an act of insight, although of extremely fallible insight. It is true that the different elements of the hypothesis were in our minds before; but it is the idea of putting together what we had never before dreamed of putting together which flashes the new suggestion before our contemplation\" \\parencite*[126]{nubiola_abduction_2005}. This \"flash\" of insight\u2014the creative recombination of existing knowledge into novel hypotheses\u2014requires precisely the kind of non-linear cognitive movement that next-token prediction architecturally precludes.\n\nMore fundamentally, abduction requires the capacity to notice and be annoyed by what is not present: gaps, anomalies, or unexpected absences in a pattern. As Nubiola notes, \"The starting point of research is always abduction. It generates the hypothesis that suggests what experiments must be performed, in which directions it is necessary to look\" \\parencite[123]{nubiola_abduction_2005}. LLMs, however, are structurally limited to processing what is explicitly present in their context window. They cannot recognise what should be there but is not, except in the most mechanistic pattern-completion scenarios that have been extensively represented in their training data.\n\nThis limitation connects directly to our concept of technoscholasticism. Just as medieval scholastics prioritised reconciling authoritative texts over investigating empirical anomalies, LLMs reconcile or ignore conflicting information rather than recognising contradictions as signals requiring investigation. The scholastic impulse to harmonise disparate authorities finds its contemporary expression in the LLM's statistical tendency to not notice contradictions within its context window, even when it is blithely explaining them away.\n\nThis architectural constraint helps explain the phenomenon identified in Dwarkesh's question: why, despite having \"basically the entire corpus of human knowledge memorised,\" these systems haven't \"been able to make a single new connection that has led to a discovery\" \\parencite{tabarrok_dwarkeshs_2025}. Without the capacity for genuine surprise or the ability to notice erroneous expectations, LLMs cannot initiate the abductive processes that Peirce identified as the necessary starting point for research. They can simulate the products of research, such as literature reviews or syntheses of existing knowledge, but cannot yet perform the cognitive act that initiates new research directions to achieve goals set by others or in pursuit of goals they themselves set.\n\nThe implications for researchers are significant. When using these tools, the responsibility for abductive insight---for noticing unexpected patterns, contradictions, or gaps---remains entirely with the human user. The LLM may assist in aggregating information or even in certain deductive reasoning tasks, but it cannot identify which patterns merit investigation or which contradictions signal potential discoveries. This limitation necessitates a research workflow that deliberately integrates human abductive reasoning at regular intervals, rather than delegating extended sequences of research activity to the LLM itself.\n\n\\subsubsection{Correspondence with Reality}\n% - \"Carnapian confirmation\" approach\n% - Internal \"truthiness\" thresholds\n% - Primacy of textual authority over empirical testing\n% - Absence of experimental approach\n% - Inability to discard bad outputs based on real-world criteria\n\nThe third critical dimension of judgement absent in current AI systems concerns their lack of correspondence with reality \\parencite{ballsun-stanton_is_2024}. LLMs infer signs without reference to their referents, producing statistically likely token sequences rather than statements grounded in real-world evidence. This disconnection proves particularly problematic in research tasks, where evaluating claims against empirical evidence constitutes essential scholarly judgement.\n\nCorrespondence with reality in scholarly research requires specific and intentional regard for the world that words represent, not merely textual consistency or \"truthiness.\" It represents an anti-bullshit requirement in the Frankfurt and Hicks sense \\parencite{frankfurt_bullshit_2005, hicks_chatgpt_2024}, demanding non-indifference to truth and an intention that statements should be confirmed, tested, or falsified against the real world.\n\nCurrent AI systems demonstrate what we term a \"discount Carnapian confirmation\" approach. Carnap proposed that \"instead of verification, we may speak of gradually increasing confirmation of the law\" \\parencite[425]{carnap_testability_1936} through accumulating observations. LLMs mimic this process by gathering textual evidence, but in a fundamentally flawed manner. While Carnap required rigorous empirical observations\\footnote{For this paper, we will set aside the significant philosophy of science debates around the demarcation problem, here. There is no Philosophy of Science position on \"fact\" that the actions of an LLM corresponds with save, perhaps that of Feyerabend.}, LLMs accept formatted text as sufficient evidence, often requiring merely a single authoritative-sounding source to confirm a claim.\n\n% TODO Shawn, you've been doing this for research onto this paper. Maybe you have better evidence for below?\n\nThis approach was evident in our examination of a ChatGPT Deep Research session focused on analysing the global state of Digital Humanities\\footnote{https://chatgpt.com/share/67d6a0c5-7648-8004-b620-70d91fdb7239}. When prompted to analyse current trends, the model uncritically accepted a 2019 website claim that the University of Adelaide offered a robust Digital Humanities program. It then proceeded to cite this outdated information as evidence of a growing trend: \"Prior to 2020, only a few DH degrees existed; by 2025, numerous universities offer undergraduate minors, BAs, MAs, and graduate certificates in DH.\" (ChatGPT Deep Research run 11 March 2025, model unclear) Without verifying whether the program remained active or successful, the model constructed an entire narrative about disciplinary expansion based on a single outdated webpage.\n\nThis uncritical approach exemplifies the scholastic fallacy inherent in LLM operations. Medieval scholasticism privileged textual authority over empirical investigation, where:\n\\begin{quote}\nThat is, authorities pro and con were given on one hundred and fifty questions in the-\nology, while the conclusion was left for the reader to reach on the basis of carefully stated rules. ...  The felt result is that of discovering truth in particular reality as secure as the universality from which the search makes its start. The subsequent rests always upon the prior; and, as the work progresses, no detail is omitted in a most meticulous tracing of ramifications, while references to preceding proof multiply much as in mathematical demonstration. It is intended, of course, that the admission of each succeeding stage shall permit no recourse in the issue. So the movement of thought suggests the irrevocable necessity of a machine. \\parencite[211-212]{longwell_significance_1928}\n\\end{quote}\nSimilarly, LLMs privilege content with markers of authenticity rather than verifiable facts. By collecting citations like stamps and prioritizing evidence confirming existing worldviews, LLMs build reasoning chains disconnected from empirical verification, accepting the first plausible source as representative of the whole.\n\nWhat specifically prevents LLMs from corresponding with reality? Four critical historiographical assessment capabilities are absent:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item They exhibit an inability to distinguish claims from trends. LLMs accept individual institutional statements as representative of broader patterns without sufficient evidence. \n    \\item They fail to consider authorship and temporality. The model does not evaluate when content was created, by whom, or for what purpose, treating all text as equally current and valid regardless of date or source motivation.\n    \\item They cannot relate claims to tacit, social, or experiential knowledge. Without engagement with the physical world, LLMs cannot compare textual assertions against known realities.\n    \\item They adopt a default position of acceptance rather than skepticism. Unlike human researchers who approach claims critically, LLMs begin from a position of trust, especially for well-formatted content from apparently authoritative domains.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThese deficiencies stem from structural limitations in how LLMs process information. In our testing, we have observed poor performance at what we term \"model-of-mind-of-mind\" tasks\\footnote{One of Ballsun-Stantons model evaluations involves getting specific models to play social deduction games against each other. Models tested to date are very bad at both maintaining a false reality to others and slightly less bad at detecting that false reality. These evals do not test if the models can \\textit{role-play} deception, in a moustache-twirling villain sense. They test if they can hold a model of the world within their context window and persuade others to a \\textit{contradictory} model.}. LLMs struggle to hold contradictions within the context window, similar to their vulnerability to prompt injection attacks\\parencite[see][]{willison_prompt_2023}. This uncriticality of input means that formatted text is trusted so long as it has the appropriate medium in McLuhan's sense. The model's tendency to treat text as authoritative based on its appearance rather than its substance and relationship to other texts represents a fundamental epistemological flaw.\n\nWhen confronted with uncertainty or contradictory authorities, human researchers design experiments or seek additional evidence to resolve discrepancies. LLMs, however, do not independently propose empirical verification or acknowledge their epistemological limitations. Instead, they continue generating plausible-sounding text regardless of its correspondence to reality.\n\nThis limitation represents a fundamental epistemological barrier to LLMs functioning as independent research agents. They operate within what Longwell describes as scholastic reasoning, where \"the modern reader has only to select carefully the underlying assumptions, and consciously accept them, to be swept along irresistibly from one stage to the next until an end is reached as sure and indubitable as was the beginning\" \\parencite[212-213]{longwell_significance_1928}. For LLMs, these underlying assumptions comprise the user's prompt, context window content, and statistical patterns from training data. Rather than employing rigorous logic, however, they simply execute search\\_with\\_bing or similar functions and accept whatever formatted text they encounter.\n\nEven as LLMs improve in fluency and factual recall, this disconnection from reality ensures they remain incapable of exercising the judgment necessary for genuine research insight. The AI will never evaluate its words and conclude, \"These aren't good enough to share with the user.\" It exemplifies what we term the \"Scholastic fallacy,\" where only authoritative-seeming text matters, not the world itself.\n\n\n\\subsection{Nature of Research Work}\n% - Literature reviews as persuasive, not descriptive documents\n% - Role of judgment in scholarly contribution\n% - Selection and organization as intellectual acts\n% - Situating research within scholarly traditions\n% - Identifying genuine knowledge gaps\n\nResearch writing, particularly literature reviews, serves functions far beyond mere information aggregation and description. As \\textcite{kelly_how_2003} observes, effective scholarly writing requires mastery of \"specific argumentative practices\" within disciplinary contexts, where authors must learn \"what kinds of claims people make; how they advance them; what literatures people rely on and how these literatures are invoked within arguments\" (p. 30). This dual nature of research writing---simultaneously informative and persuasive---reveals a fundamental gap in AI research capabilities. While large language models excel at accumulating and synthesising textual information, they currently lack the capacity or the developed prompts to engage in the normative judgements required for genuine scholarly persuasion.\n\nLiterature reviews specifically establish two critical argumentative elements: situating research within a disciplinary context and demonstrating that the research question has not been adequately addressed. \\textcite{rochma_rhetorical_2025} identifies that unsuccessful academic writing often frames \"studies as responses to personal challenges rather than addressing gaps in prior research\" (p. 321). Similarly, \\textcite{feak_telling_2009} notes that effective literature reviews must \"contribute to the argumentative shape of the introduction\" and lead \"to the conclusion that the new research is relevant\" (p. 10). These persuasive functions require normative judgments about disciplinary relevance and novelty: judgments that current AI architectures are not designed to make. The predominant pattern observed across multiple AI research implementations tested by the authors is the production of what Rochma characterizes as the \"personal challenges\" mode (\"Here is what I found\") rather than identifying genuine gaps in the literature. This limitation stems from a fundamental constraint: next-token prediction models are inherently designed to work with positive pattern completion rather than the negative inference required to identify what is absent yet significant within a body of literature.\n\nEffective research further requires discernment in source selection that transcends pattern matching. \\textcite{wilson_second-hand_1983}'s concept of \"cognitive authority\" and \\textcite{fritch_evaluating_2001}'s work on authority evaluation emphasise that researchers must assess \"how much cognitive authority to ascribe to a particular individual or institution\" and consider \"quality and credibility\" when working with information sources \\parencite[499]{fritch_evaluating_2001}. In systematic testing of current Deep Research implementations from multiple vendors, we observed consistent failures to assess source credibility despite explicit instructions to \"evaluate source and author quality\" and \"avoid those from paper mills and predatory journals.\" The systems demonstrated no evidence of checking author bibliographies, examining citation networks, or evaluating author credentials. These requested checking-tasks are precisely the evaluative steps that Wilson and Fritch identify as essential to cognitive authority assessment. Instead, they matched patterns of academic formatting, in the McLuhan sense, looking at content without evaluating source authority, a limitation observed across multiple prompting strategies and infrastructures.\n\nThese source selection deficiencies connect directly to the deficit in abductive reasoning established earlier (Subsection \\ref{subsub:inductive}). Without the capacity for what Peirce termed the flash of insight or experience of surprise when encountering unexpected patterns, AI systems cannot identify meaningful research gaps. The absence of abductive reasoning undermines the very foundation of novel research identification: the ability to notice what is missing yet significant within existing knowledge structures. This limitation is not merely technical but epistemological; statistical pattern completion fundamentally differs from the abductive and generative act of identifying unexplored territory in scholarly landscapes.\n\nThe limitations observed in AI research capabilities exemplify  technoscholasticism. Just as medieval scholastics privileged textual authority over empirical verification, current AI systems treat well-formatted academic texts as inherently authoritative without evaluating their actual credibility or relevance. This directly connects to the correspondence-with-reality deficit discussed earlier. The pattern of judgment deficiencies across epistemic humility, inductive reasoning, and correspondence with reality manifests specifically in research contexts as an inability to make the normative evaluations required for genuine scholarship. While AI systems offer utility for information retrieval and initial organisation, they function best as tools augmenting human judgment rather than autonomous research agents. The essential functions of disciplinary relevance assessment, authority evaluation, and gap identification require human judgments that cannot be replicated through statistical token prediction, regardless of how sophisticated these models become.\n\n\n% Initial draft\n% \\section{Agentic Systems}\n\n% #  \"Agentic\" Systems vs Normal Software\n\n% ## Goal-Related Characteristics\n% 1.

This failure consumed \\$1 of tokens, which is to say, 1.2 million tokens (mostly in screenshots) of failure to click, failure to right click, failure to change apps between firefox and libreoffice, and wittering about trying to solve its own navigation problems. \n\n% However, this does not require a difference in kind, merely a degree. This paradigm of computer use is a future of computer augmented research, since it got the idea of what we wanted to do. It simply failed at execution due to a deductive deficiency. The first chat was lost due to an inadvertent window closure (and the fact that absolutely no logs are kept by this demo application). The second one is in our supplemental data.) While we are sure that some prompt improvements can be made, as this was our second attempt at using computer use, further iteration would not reward the effort.\n\n% No prompting has been shared for Computer Use, as we were not able to proceed beyond our initial proof of concept. It is clear that with sufficient budget, and human supervision, Computer Use would be able to gradually navigate around web pages and extract data. It is simply not an efficient use of time or money at this stage of Claude 3.5 Sonnet's capabilities.\n\n\\subsection{Elicit Research Assistant}\n% - Corpus limitations\n% - Search criteria challenges\n% - Screening criteria application\n% - Report quality evaluation\n\n\n\n% \\subsection{Elicit Research Paper}\n\n% For Elicit, we provided the following prompt:\n\n% \\begin{quote}\n\n% Research question: Within the literature of archaeology and the historical sciences, constructed broadly, what software tools exist as discussed in the literature from 1995 onwards? Specifically, we are looking for you to examine the journals of: Internet Archaeology, SoftwareX, JOAD, JOSS, JCAA, and STAR (Science \\& Tech of Archaeological Research). We define a tool as: ```For our project, a software tool is any discrete piece of software\u2014be it a program, script, or web application\u2014that is developed or substantially modified by researchers to perform specific, research-oriented computational tasks. These tasks must involve active data processing, such as analysis, simulation, visualization, modeling, or automation, where input data is dynamically created, documented, transformed, or interpreted to generate meaningful results. In contrast, products whose primary function is to simply display, store, or promote static datasets\u2014without offering mechanisms for active computational engagement\u2014are excluded. In essence, a valid software tool for our purposes is one that not only **supports research in archaeology or historical sciences** but does so by actively collecting and/or processing data rather than merely serving as a generic data repository or static interface.``` The objective of this research report is to find and cite EVERY SINGLE software tool (from our construction above) as mentioned in those journals SO LONG as those software tools have specific and direct applicability or citation within papers about archaeological and historical sciences. Some of those journals are discipline specific, and we need to look through for software tool mentions (mere published datasets are not interesting to us). Some of those journals are tool specific, and we need to look through for DISCIPLINE mentions, to ensure that the tool has specific and direct relevance to historians and archaeologists. My objective here is either a bulleted list of citations, or if you can manage it a csv of citations for further work. The intention is that this research will support a paper on software longevity.\n\n% \\end{quote}\n\n% We did not believe that it would accomplish any real proportion of the prompt, but given that the Elicit team provided us a coupon for the \"Plus\" plan (\\$12/month), the available capabilities afforded to us were a one-prompt-and-go text area. Elicit's own infrastructure evaluated this prompt as a \"Great question.\" Unlike with our assessment of Anthropic's Computer Use, we believe that changes in both kind and degree are necessary for Elicit to be useful for research data collection.

This distinction necessitates examining not only their linguistic output but also the concrete actions and outcomes that their words produce. However, this lack merely prevents us from treating them as true agents, \\textit{not} as extracting mundane utility from them as tools. This paper is an investigation into the creation of a research-grade dataset using OpenAI's Deep Research in February 2025, acting as a case study --- and our ``autoethnographic'' reflection upon the use of this tool for what Zvi Moshowitz calls ``mundane utility.\"\n\n% Here, we will also give our understanding of the necessary prerequsities for an ``agentic'' tool, and why we believe that this infrastructure, at this time, does not satisfy that criteria. We will also discuss the fundamental lack of judgement that these models exhibit, and why it is this core incapability which prevents an accumulation of patterns-shaped-like-knowledge to answer Dwarkesh's question to Cohen: ``what do you make of the fact that these things have basically the entire corpus of human knowledge memorized and they haven\u2019t been able to make a single new connection that has led to a discovery? Whereas if even a moderately intelligent person had this much stuff memorized, they would notice \u2014 Oh, this thing causes this symptom.'' We assert that the lack of induction exhibited by even currently accessible frontier models like o3-mini-high, answers this question. To be clear, this paper is a description of what we have experienced in our attempt to actively use these models to research and answer an academic question --- not merely to conduct a \\textit{descriptive} literature review, but to find that central spark of insight which represents a contribution to the literature. We do not say that these capabilities are forever barred to these models, merely that they do not exhibit them yet and that the common errors in estimating the capabilities of these models based on \\textit{what they say} rather than \\textit{how they act} can lead to confusion as to their actual capabilities and hinder finding places of mundane utility in our use of these tools. \n</paper>\n\nTo begin, give me a functional decomposition of my instructions, a detailed summary of the sources I've given you, and a readback of what I think our first task should be.\n"

            "<transcripts>\n'20250214 - discussion and utility.m4a'\n\nUm\nOkey dokey. Try this again.\n\nSo the structure of the paper is we have our discussion of why these things are not agentic. We have our discussion of the mundane utility and our experiences. Um\nand our experiences of using it for research. And then we have the discussion of what what do we need in a tool that genuinely does the research?\n\nHow do we facilitate what these things are good at? How do we interact with these things knowing that they are deficient in judgment?\n\nAnd so the first thing that we need is a cursored to-do list. [\u0259\u02c8k\u025c\u02d0s\u0259d t\u0259\u02c8du\u02d0 l\u026ast] Right? The the first thing that we need is to to actively manage each step in the to-do list so that we can get the user's judgment as to correctness. Because the thing is is that for research, there will be dead ends, there will be blind alleys, and this is not, this is not the, 'Oh, I'm not able to access that on an unencrypted drive' that we saw in 7 February launch. [l\u0254\u02d0nt\u0283]\n\nThis is going to be, 'Oh, this line of thinking is going to be wrong'. This output is bad. This is not appropriate. I should remove this. Because fundamentally, fundamentally what we see is that these um\nWhat language models are not capable of doing self-critical. They don't exhibit judgment. But more to the point, they don't have the inductive capacity, the intuition or whatever, to know when they should. And therefore, until we figure out some new technological advance that is not merely predicting the next token, as useful as that is, we need to anchor um that on human judgment.\n\nSo, we need to be able to move around our to-do list, right? It is it is insufficient to as as as the current {quote} agentic {end quote} things do, just take it step-by-step, right? Like the idea of a waterfall model of research is laughable. Ooh, yes. Uh, we should have that a note towards um the problems of SDLCs and why that's such a problem for us.\nUm.\nBut.\nThis to-do list should should first off, allow us to see what's in the context window and to see what we're working on. But the the fundamental thing that these large language models don't have is the ability to forget. To judge that a certain line of thinking is bad and then to remove it. Because we know by virtue of how they work that these large language models will anchor on text in their context window. Which means that as they anchor on this text, if it's the wrong text, not only not only is it excluding um content that we want, but it's biasing the output in ways that's not appropriate. And so therefore, when we build literature for our deep research, we effectively need a an indication of what sources it has considered, what it's using, and more to the point, what it's disusing.\nUm, and so.\nSo, effectively, considering that we're playing the game of of um limited context windows, and it's it's hilarious that 200,000 tokens is limited, but what we're talking about, I've I've easily blown the context window out with trying to drop in nine papers. So, 200,000 tokens is not sufficient to do research in. Therefore, we need a way of managing our tokens.\nAnd what this means, and we also need introspection. We need to be able to validate this. We need, ha, transparency. Not merely in the encoded thoughts, but okay, at this step, we have a this paper, we are pulling these quotes from it. Here is our summary and understanding. Here is where in our document we should be using this paper. When we get to this part of our document, load the entire paper into the context window for this paragraph.\nRight? And so this is why outlines are so useful is because they allow us to go, ah, when we get to that part of the outline, when we get to that part of the mechanism, whatever, that's not the right word, but whatever, go change your context window, your working context window, to go spin off a line of thought or whatever, to apply that paper to this paragraph within the context of the section and and the document. And so we need but we also need human judgment, right? The first draft is always shit.\nThe first lines of research are seldom the most correct lines. And so therefore these systems have to leverage human judgment. And and not in the double confirm that Deep Research does right now, right? Because Deep Research right now takes this, takes the entire context window, you push Deep Research, and then it it crunches down what it thinks its task is, and then you say go, or you give it a bit of feedback and it goes. That's not what I'm talking about, right? This is not agentic, it is not goal following. We cannot treat it as goal following. We must treat it as a tool. It's just a tool. It is a tool that can be useful, it's a tool that can be thoughtful. It's just a tool. Treat it that way.\n\nDon't remember if I talked about deleting. But we also need tombstones. We need to have indications of thoughts that we've had that are bad. And we have to be able to remove them durably from the context window, but we need to have proof that we've had this thought and chosen not to have it.\nUm which is ironic, but whatever.\nUm.\n\nOkay. What time is it?\nand need to wrap up.\nUm.\nWe have the outline, we have forgetting, we have... I don't know where we have forgetting. We have user judgment.\n\nAnd then we have Cheers. And then we have\n\nAnd then we have different stages of interaction where finding literature, extracting the literature, building the outline, building the first draft, revising the draft, editing, and then outputting should all be documented. And so this is why we we can't necessarily follow a waterfall SDLC when we're producing 10,000 word research reports. We have to consider instead that we have to treat each step in its own step, that we need to have different mechanisms for keeping track of this information. We need to choose which of these pots we're pulling from. And at every stage, we have to rely on human judgment knowing that the AI's judgment is deficient, but more to the point, not only is it deficient, it doesn't know that it's deficient, it doesn't know when to apply the judgment. Cool.\n\n'20250214 - mundane utility.m4a'\n\nI suppose I should speak to the mundane utility section.\nYeah, looks like. Okay.\n\nSo if we're talking about if we're talking about use cases, I suppose the first place we need to be talking about is data collection.\nUm.\nSo this is this is specifically this is specifically based on the SoftwareX um run on 14th February.\nAnd so so this this the SoftwareX run was the opposite of the Internet Archaeology one, right? So.\nUm.\nThe SoftwareX run was the opposite of the Internet Archaeology run. SoftwareX has uh, 30-odd volumes filled with people writing about the software tools. But very few of them are archaeology, historical science related.\nTherefore, my task to it was go find all of the articles in this journal that relate to big old tool list. [b\u026a\u0261 \u0259\u028ald tu\u02d0l l\u026ast]\nAnd And to a first approximation, it did that.\nBut the interesting thing here is it did that indirectly because those articles were not trivially visible because Elsevier blocks OpenAI's crawler. Uh, we need a to-do here um to compare against Computer Use.\nAnd so it hit what seemed like a plausible set of articles, and even hit a plausible set of borderline articles.\nI am not certain, um, and quite frankly, this is this is a a to-do Sean to to see what his double check um cross-check could show, because because if this list [\u00f0\u026as l\u026ast] Um, because if this was a useful series of articles, then in 20 odd minutes, three of which were blocked, we had a topic-specific reading.\nUS UK this this looking for systematic code that the include better find more on.\nBecause if we presume if we presume this to be the case, then you say, okay, Deep Research, go find me all articles from this journal that relate to this topic.\nNow, the difference between this search and Jacob's search is one, this was bounded and well-specified. And quite frankly, a relatively small dataset.\nWhich means that if somehow you can hook the computer up to Web of Science, then we can use the regular bibliography approach. Um, to do reference peculiar bibliographies in [\u0259] reference section for appendices. Um.\nFor Winner. Because the problem with getting a paper and then finding all papers that reference it, and all papers it references, and through generations is that most of them most of them aren't aren't on research topics. Just going, yeah. So that most of them aren't on the research topic that we actually care about. Right? And so if we figure in a position Obviously, all of this is predicated on open access papers or papers that you have institutional access to. Noting that SoftwareX papers are open access, but because SoftwareX is not discoverable to OpenAI, they are only discoverable through inference. Um, which is stupid, because if it's an open access paper, then it whatever that's not relevant. Um.\nOnce we figure out how to confine for every article in a journal, Oh, I know what. No, I am dreaming. It's like this sort of filtering, this sort of filtering relation is useful in the aggregate. Um, When we told it to get real dynamic responses, but for every university in Australia, I know it did 17 of 35. Um, we don't know why it didn't do the other 17, sure, let's whatever. Um, although I do know that 17 is halfway + 0.5, [p\u0254\u026ant fa\u026av] so I suspect maybe doing an AB test internally. But this discussion of utility here creates connects nicely back to and the offline connects nicely back to knowing if it's done something. Um, maybe submit feedback. Um, This systematic give me, you know, every single instance of X because X can be specified, I think that we also need to highlight that the literature review mode and to do Sean get that listed back way in on the the GitHub site. Um, but the literature review mode actually hides more than it helps. Sure, we get a 10,000 word um thank you median essay and report and uh we needed to give acknowledgements to CoPilot Vision for not analogy. Um.\nBut the the fact that go through every paper and determine those ones about this paradigm is useful. This is of course also a question given that our PhD sequence suggests knowing about literature. Um, should they not simply be reading every paper? And like, is it not better to have them do this literature review by hand? But I think that that is sufficient for effective use cases. Obviously how you adjust for your knowing. Like this is important. This discussion of utility and how it connects nicely back to knowing if it's done something should be part of the PhD supervisor's um toolkit. And then pulling back comments like this uh is useful where my previous notes fix that the third activity students do badly and give you awesome results that have no bearing on reality is that sure, marginal papers or borderline papers, it is far more interesting for the PhD student to read the output models and then to verify and cross-check the output models than simply reading I don't know. Actually prod, um get this, can you, can you engage with some co-pilot argumentation here? Now I see that the canonical places and it comes back to this one. Yeah. But I think that that is sufficient for effective use cases.\n\n\n\n'20250217 - Judgement epistemic humility.m4a'\n\nJudgment as epistemic humility, I.e., the ability to know when the relative epistemic quality of each of its um starting over. Okay, so large language models lack judgment. In this case, we can we can model the judgment that they lack in in three axes. And and um, uh, to-do note, uh, cross reference that student judge formalism uh paper that came out recently. Um. Fuck.\nAh, my brain's not here. So, one, they epistemic uh they lack epistemic humility. So, they don't have a sense of not knowing. Um. Pause.\nEh, is this still going?\nYes. Okay.\nPants, pants, pants.\nAnd so here, we can kind of talk about the the problems of confabulations. Um, because again, the the issue is not the confabulation itself. This is like people are allowed to be wrong. There's there's nothing wrong with being wrong.\nThere's nothing wrong with being wrong.\nThe epistemic humility action or fraction of of judgment though is the ability to doubt your own words. Now, obviously, as these things cannot elide their own context windows, which I'm actually kind of surprised hasn't come up, but whatever. Um, this would need to be an intentional step. The problem is large language models exhibit very poor epistemic humility on their own output. And and I I I describe this ow as a class. Um, just as that they are bad at detecting their own output. They're also bad at calling doubt on their own output. And again, with all of this, the impulse for judge the impulse to judge, the impulse to self-critique does not does not is not a pattern exhibited in their training data. And for obvious reasons, published work doesn't have that thought pattern in it because it is the consequence of that thought pattern. Um, uh some reference for episodic versus procedural memories. Um, and so when we talk about this, this in terms of a failure of judgment, it is both and and then the subset of epistemic humility, it is both the lack of the impulse to self-critique and lack of the ability to self-critique. Um.\nAnd while and while asking a model to engage in proleptic reasoning, uh reference my recent paper to do. Um, proleptic reasoning is an argumentation approach if you already have sufficient epistemic grounding. And it is identifying this precursorial whatever that word, yeah, sure why not. Precursorial lack, precursor lack? Eh, one of them. that is the problem.\nThe second problem is the lack of induction. And again, 03 mini high showed that it's better at pattern matching when prompted to do so. Um, maybe have an appendix on on Zendo, right? But like a lot of the point of induction is not, 'Oh, I am going to try to perform induction right now'. It is not a for the vast majority of cases, specific intentional activity. More it is that we can claim that induction induction quad judgment is the precursor to common sense. Um, it is the it is the precursor to noticing that there is something in what you have produced because again, all of this is all of this is in the context of producing the next token. We're not we're not doing any theory of mind stuff here.\nBut induction in this instance is is the act of noticing that while one of the elements of what you've written looks plausible, it lacks coherency relative to what you have written. It it you you notice it in terms of uh judgment and induction, induction is noticing the deviation from pattern and the impulse of inquiry for that deviation. Okay. Awesome. I didn't actually say what the third category was. Um.\nLet's work this out from first principles. So we have epistemic hu- humility. We have induction. And And yes, we can say here, induction is the impulse precursor to common sense. It is the impulse notice noticing when something you've written doesn't follow a pattern.\nWe can say that the third option here or the the the third element of judgment as needed in LLMs is ironically, we could say something like agency. We can't say that, that that word's overloaded in this context.\nWe can kind of talk about Rumsfeld's epistemology here and talk about known unknowns and known knowns and so on and so forth.\nAnd how epistemic humility is in many ways a acknowledgement of known unknowns.\nBut the third aspect of judgment that even reasoning models are lacking is And we can't really we can't really say goal checking, right? Like we we can't we can't make this a circular argument.\nAll right, let's just work through this in a case study, right? So, thinking out loud, they always give you an answer.\nRight. So, so we can say they always give you an answer and that answer is always presented as correct.\nAnd we can say that that evinces a lack of epistemic humility.\nBut it feels like there's a different category here.\nIt feels like that that category is not just epistemic humility.\nAh, prospective versus retrospective. So there there is a a prospective epistemic humility which is to say I don't know enough to answer that question.\nAnd then there then there's the faux humility that we see in reasoning models, especially in stuff like R1, where you have 'Wait, but what about this?', right? And and and that language of 'Well, what about this?' displays epistemic humility.\nBut I would actually assert that that performance of epistemic humility is the pretense of epistemic humility rather than the fact of it. Because the thing is, when when R1 is doing, 'Well, what about X?' It is effectively It is effectively trying to cause itself to describe an option space of possible answers.\nIt is it is effectively motivating a deductive reasoning process here. And LLMs are entirely adequate at deductive reasoning, right? They can transform data. That if they have to motivate themselves to explore a decision tree or an option set with with the performance of humility, sure, whatever.\nBut the reason why it is the performance of epistemic humility and not actual epistemic humility, is that process never ever results in it saying, 'I don't know'. I or I mean, look, and and we can turn that down. We could say, 'Oh, I don't have enough information to to come to this conclusion.' It never it never actually acts upon its notice of deficiencies. It always uses that language of 'Well, what about?' to create more options, and those options can be contrary to the other options and I have no fundamental issue with this performance of of epistemic humility just like it can engage in the performance of judgment.\nIt is the phrase, 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating'. It is Yes, it is the phrase, 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating'. It is when we are engaged in something that we are uncertain on, or more to the point, when we judge that our knowledge of the thing is insufficient to epistemically differentiate between possible realities, we run experiments. And this is the fundamental flaw of deep research. It's Aristotelian. Ooh, I like this. Okay, so this is another one, that two an AI, text and authority has primacy over reality. I mean, it it has to. It's that's that's baked into the thing itself, which means that oh I love this. AI's are fundamentally Aristotelian that we make arguments or sorry that AI makes arguments by looking for authorities. And and and this is in mostly in deep research that we've noticed that there's no real appeal to authority in, for example, the model Claude. Um, sorry Claude, this is me talking about not you, not to you. Um.\nBut these models never These models never engage with the real.\nThese models never engage with the real.\nI mean, obviously, they're they're they're digital thing. But this they never Besides saying 'I don't know', they also never say 'I can't know'. Yes, okay, and this is the third category.\nRight? That when we It is the Aristotelian fallacy or paradigm work on it, um, that if an August source makes the claim, we don't have to investigate the claim.\nRight? And so the fundamental thing here, Oh, I should pause.\nSo to conclude, we can say that the Aristotelian fallacy is that the world doesn't matter. That an AI will never ever look at its words and go, 'Nah, those those weren't good. Let me throw them out instead of giving them to the user'. And it will never go, 'Well, there are two possible courses of action here. Here's what you should be looking for in the world to differentiate between them'. It does sometimes say that there's two opposing arguing authorities, but again, this is still the Aristotelian issue is that we can we can acknowledge fighting authorities, we just can't acknowledge an authority being wrong about the world unless it says so. And so it'll never say, 'Well, go try this, see if it works, report back'. It will never say, 'Well, I can't get that paper. Could you go get it for me?'\nAnd so the flaw in judgment is that it always has to deliver a coherent and final answer. And again, all of this can be circumvented if the human is injecting this into their prompts. And so if we if we cause it, it can certainly perform all of these functions. The proof of this is not does it, can it pretend, can it can it have pretense to these functions. The basis of this is does it act this way in the absence of other stimuli? And even even if we push it, does it act appropriately? Because the problem is is that in many of these tests, it can use the words of the thing without engaging in the fact of the thing. But that's another discussion.\n\n\n\n'20250220 - Obs deep research.m4a'\n\nSound check, sound check.\nSound check, sound check.\nOkay.\n\nSo, observations of Deep Research.\nOkay, so Anthropic's Computer Use was about 80% of the way to a workable prototype. Um.\nIt simply was too expensive for its capabilities. Elicit was an exceptionally disappointing experiment. Again, talking about the capabilities of their LLMs. Like setting apart everything else, setting apart their problematic reliance on Semantic Scholar and so on and so forth.\nSo the largest specific fundamental flaw of all of these systems is their corpus.\nUm, even Yeah, is their corpus.\nFor Deep Research, the Internet Archaeology iterator seemed quite promising.\nAlthough the the frequent cajoling to be systematic really started showing the seams.\nHowever, it was the exploration of the Journal of Open Source Software that really demonstrated the fundamental flaws of the system. Because here's the thing, corpuses can be fixed, right? Corpus access can be fixed. The fundamental lack of systemization, even when explicitly instructed to probably as a function of some of the back-end prompting that OpenAI has added means that it simply will not work down a list of sources, which are open, right? This is a list of sources that was found by Deep Research. They're all in the same journal, they are all well formatted.\nAnd so therefore, this fundamental flaw of the lack of systemization shows that Deep Research is not presently at the level of a research assistant. Um, I will also note that there are some really interesting introduced biases um from OpenAI's {quote} policies {end quote} that when it is thinking, especially as when it is mulling over the policy, the text of the policies infects the output. So, as an aside, I was transcribing a recent presentation of mine about AI, and OpenAI O1 Pro quite clearly took the text from one of the policies and put it in the place in in um what not place, inferred. My inference is that OpenAI took the place of one of the policies and replaced it with one of my questions. And so the problem is again and again, because we don't have a separation of concerns and because and because all of these All of So because we don't have a separation of concerns, because we don't have letting the sources speak for themselves, the current mechanisms of Deep Research are fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, and a interesting deviation from Claude, getting O1 to work on its own prompts does not, in fact, improve output quality. It has a very bad estimation of its own output.\nAnd so while while there is why would you do that? Um.\nAnd so while we have these things, and while I assert that O1 and O3 mini high represent a difference in degree and in kind from prior models such that the way I interact with them has become a function of the way I would interact with PhD students. The fundamental limitations, especially the frequent invocations to the spirits um to to think harder, which as an aside made me feel like a Doc Smith character, suggest that these models still lack the judgment and these models still lack the insight to know when they have done a good job.\nUm. So what we what would we need in a system for it to improve. We need multiple supervisory threads. If policy enforcement is the deal that it needs, which is fine, it needs a supervisory thread to review and edit. It needs a intrusive thought thread for when it's looking for validation. And the validation should not be wholly contained within the context window, but instead the validation uh should be threaded out, then there needs to be a corpus where under the context of going to find things, it needs to be to build a document store where it can collect and build a corpus without necessarily all of that corpus living in the context window at any given time. We need to be able to inspect that corpus in a much better than train of thought mode. And furthermore, the finding and the validation should be um threaded out, then there needs to be a corpus where under the context of going to find things, it needs to be to build a document store where it can collect and build a corpus without necessarily all of that corpus living in the context window at any given time. We need to be able to inspect that corpus in a much better than train of thought mode. And fundamentally, it needs to dis- um it needs to figure out when its first draft is unacceptable and when it needs more research. But it also needs to be able to indicate sources in its corpus should not be considered for a draft. It needs more structure, it needs to be able to make outlines and write to the outlines. It needs to have an obvious editing pass. It needs to be a real boy.\n\n\n\n'20250225 - current capabilities tool-using nonagentic.m4a'\n\nOkay.\nAt current capabilities, as of February 2025, the tool using, but not agentic, Deep Research and its clones by Perplexity and Hugging Face are deeply flawed, deeply impressive tech demos.\nIn this paper, we will discuss why we believe that the term agentic does not appropriately apply to these tools, save as a term of marketing, and why we believe that these tools represent a difference in degree and in kind much like the the tech demo of Bing Sydney in February 2023.\nTo be clear, these tools have the capabilities to genuinely assist researchers in research, so long as said researchers do not believe any of the marketing hype of the companies that produce them. By default, the 'literature reviews' {in quotes} produced by these tools are descriptive, superficial, and fundamentally misdefined.\nTo remind ourselves of methods classes, the point of a literature review is effectively to do two things. One, it is to situate the research within a specific and known scholarship. This is both an argument what? This is both an argument by authority, i.e., these other scholars have have investigated the same thing, have engaged with the same thing. Therefore, this is an appropriate thing for me to be doing as it is a claim to disciplinarity. The way I will be investigating it is this, the research program in the Lakatoshian sense with its concomitant hard core and soft outer belt is that. All of these things are accomplished by the first prong of the literature review. The second prong of the literature review is informally speaking, why do we care? Or why has this question not already been answered? Or again, where's the novelty? The fundamental requirement of both of these prongs is judgment. It is insufficient to merely describe what papers have said. A literature review is not a descriptive summarization of the literature. A literature review is the process by which researchers build a case for why this question should be answered. Now, can we say that a descriptive literature review is appropriate for other fields? No. I don't need to say that. I know what I'm doing. Um.\nSo, what we what would we need in a system for it to improve? It needs multiple supervisory threads. If policy enforcement is the deal that it needs, which is fine, it needs a supervisory thread to review and edit. It needs a intrusive thought thread for when it's looking for validation. And the validation should not be wholly contained within the context window, but instead the validation uh should be threaded out. Then there needs to be a corpus where under the context of going to find things, it needs to be to build a document store where it can collect and build a corpus without necessarily all of that corpus living in the context window at any given time. We need to be able to inspect that corpus in a much better than train of thought mode. And fundamentally, it needs to dis- um it needs to figure out when its first draft is unacceptable and when it needs more research. But it also needs to be able to indicate sources in its corpus should not be considered for a draft. It needs more structure. It needs to be able to make outlines and write to the outlines. It needs to have an obvious editing pass. It needs to be a real boy.\n\n\n'20250228 - Agentic.m4a'\n\nOkay.\nOkay.\nThese systems claim to be agentic, specifically possessing agency.\nIf we define possessing agency as the ability to do task decomposition, i.e., take a task, split it up into subtasks, and figure out a route that could plausibly accomplish those subtasks, we could call these systems agentic. However, agency should not be viewed as a function of task following, but it should be viewed as a function of goal accomplishing. And this this distinction is important and nuanced.\nUh, I'll clean it up in the text. But the subtask the subtask mechanism that has been popularized by things like Langchain, the um, the reification of chain of thought in reasoning models, we can have other words for these things than agentic.\nBecause my fundamental critique of the agentic definition is if we claim a space delineated by XML tags with 'think' in it is reasoning, sure, fine. Reasoning is a component of intelligence.\nAnd the problem here is that if we are asserting components of intelligence stand in for the whole thing, then it's not going to work.\nAh, that's messy. I don't like it. Anyway, we'll figure it out. Um.\nObservations of Deep Research. Okay, so Anthropic's Computer Use was about 80% of the way to a workable prototype. Um.\nIt simply was too expensive for its capabilities. Elicit was an exceptionally disappointing experiment. Again, talking about the capabilities of their LLMs. Like setting apart everything else, setting apart their problematic reliance on Semantic Scholar and so on and so forth.\nSo the largest specific fundamental flaw of all of these systems is their corpus.\nUm, even Yeah, is their corpus.\nFor Deep Research, the Internet Archaeology iterator seemed quite promising.\nAlthough the the frequent cajoling to be systematic really started showing the seams. However, it was the exploration of the Journal of Open Source Software that really demonstrated the fundamental flaws of the system. Because here's the thing, corpuses can be fixed, right? Corpus access can be fixed. The fundamental lack of systemization, even when explicitly instructed to, probably as a function of some of the back-end prompting that OpenAI has added, means that it simply will not work down a list of sources, which are open, right? This is a list of sources that was found by Deep Research. They're all in the same journal, they are all well formatted.\nAnd so therefore this fundamental flaw of the lack of systemization shows that Deep Research is not presently at the level of a research assistant. Um, I will also note that there are some really interesting introduced biases um from OpenAI's {quote} policies {end quote} that when it is thinking, especially as when it is mulling over the policies, the text of the policies infects the output. So, as an aside, I was transcribing a recent presentation of mine about AI, and OpenAI O1 Pro quite clearly took the text from one of the policies and put it in the place in in um what not place, inferred. My inference is that OpenAI took the place of one of the policies and replaced it with one of my questions. And so the problem is again and again, because we don't have a separation of concerns, and because and because all of these All of because we don't have a separation of concerns, because we don't have letting the sources speak for themselves, the current mechanisms of Deep Research are fundamentally flawed. Furthermore, and an interesting deviation from Claude, getting O1 to work on its own prompts does not, in fact, improve output quality. It has a very bad estimation of its own output.\nAnd so while while there is Oh, why would you do that? Um.\nAnd so while we have these things, and while I assert that O1 and O3 mini high represent a difference in degree and in kind from prior models, such that the way I interact with them has become a function of the way I would interact with PhD students. The fundamental limitations, especially the frequent invocations to the spirits um to to think harder, which as an aside made me feel like a Doc Smith character, suggest that these models still lack the judgment and these models still lack the insight to know when they have done a good job.\nWhat would we need in a system for it to improve? First and fundamentally, for Deep Research to be effective, it cannot have a single train of thought. It needs multiple supervisory threads. If policy enforcement is the deal that it needs, which is fine, it needs a supervisory thread to review and edit. It needs a intrusive thought thread for when it's looking for validation. And the validation should not be wholly contained within the context window, but instead the validation uh should be threaded out. Then there needs to be a corpus where under the context of going to find things, it needs to be to build a document store where it can collect and build a corpus without necessarily all of that corpus living in the context window at any given time. We need to be able to inspect that corpus in a much better than train of thought mode. And fundamentally, it needs to dis- um it needs to figure out when its first draft is unacceptable and when it needs more research. But it also needs to be able to indicate sources in its corpus should not be considered for a draft. It needs more structure. It needs to be able to make outlines and write to the outlines. It needs to have an obvious editing pass. It needs to be a real boy.\n\n\n'20250316 - skip.m4a'\n\nOkay.\nAgentic definitions in so far as the original question relates to possessing Okay, the original question was about epistemic humility, the ability to find myself clearly defining myself. Judgment versus information quality versus confidence quality. But epistemic humility is where we're going to go. Okay, general ability. My definition of agentic is when a process has the task following capabilities wherein always consists in its core processes. It receives user input. It may or may not ask for clarification. It may or may not rephrase the plan. But once it is executing that plan, once it is collecting resources and transforming resources into some kind of output, it then relies upon is transformed into its answer. It then relies on the {quote} text in its context window {end quote}. This stop is transformed This stop is transformed it then relies on text in its context window as its source of content to transform into its answer. Excuse us. Thank you. Is that an observation? These tools are called deep research in all their various modes. The implication of these tools or the the default output of these tools is the report and that is not appropriate. Um. It does not sufficiently address conflicting context. It does not sufficiently address contradictions, just says choose whatever is better. Um. However, we must therefore that if a human has made the decision to prompt them to do this, the most likely outcome of this is that they will perform an action that looks as if they are doing this. When I say that they don't exhibit judgment, it is that the impulse to edit, the impulse to self-critique does not does not is not a pattern exhibited in their training data. And for obvious reasons, published work doesn't have that thought pattern in it because it is the consequence of that thought pattern. Um. Uh, some reference for episodic versus procedural memories. Um. And so while asking a model to engage in proleptic reasoning, uh reference my recent paper to do. Um proleptic reasoning is an argumentation approach if you already have sufficient epistemic grounding. And it is identifying this precursorial whatever that word, yeah, sure why not. Precursorial lack, precursor lack? Eh, one of them. that is the problem. It is the phrase, 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating'. Yes, it is the phrase, 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating'. It is when we are engaged in something that we are uncertain on, or more to the point, when we judge that our knowledge of the thing is insufficient to epistemically differentiate between possible realities, we run experiments. And this is the fundamental flaw of Deep Research. It's Aristotelian. These models never engage with the real. I mean, obviously, they're they're they're digital thing. But this they never Besides saying 'I don't know', they also never say 'I can't know'. That when we it is the phrase, 'The proof of the pudding is in the eating'. That if an August source makes the claim, we don't have to investigate the claim. And so if this pattern of the primacy of source based on our evaluation of the source quality is not how current paradigms in the Kuhnian sense or research programs in the Lakatoshian sense, um, defend their theories. Uh, I don't re Oh, I'd love to footnote um that aside here, but I think I think we don't want to go too PhilSci here. Um, okay, so fundamentally, we need to acknowledge that large language models at present, even with {quote} reasoning {end quote} capabilities and {quote} agentic {end quote} systems, because even though that they can perform a deductive task decomposition, the fact that they cannot effectively exercise judgment, specifically that they cannot they do not as a matter of course exercise judgment over what they have written, nor do they nor are they able to assess the quality of their own inference. What this means is is that a large language model when prompted to edit its own writing, um will double down or intensify but will never question the basic precepts. When I talk about editing here, especially in the context of {quote} Deep Research {end quote}, I am not talking about the process by which we improve the tone or grammar of the output. I'm talking about the question of, 'Do we consider that this process is adequate?' And so the task decomposition shown by {quote} reasoning {end quote} models shown by telling it to think step by step, shown it to say do functional decomposition, any one of these things is certainly a component of good research, of of the process, or a component of intelligence. But even if it's just a component of intelligence, calling these things agentic leaves us a very large gulf between agentic goal following and goal setting systems. And despite claims by OpenAI that we can consider AGI a function of monetary output, which is a silly definition, if we say that in this hierarchy, task decomposition to reasoning, reasoning to goal following, claiming claiming um claiming that a agentic system may either act as our agent or act as something with agency, noting that those are two very, very different things. Both of them require the system to have the capability of exploring if the goal which has been set by external agency has been accomplished, and if it has been accomplished well. We must differentiate goal accomplishment with the basic QA processes of Anthropic's Computer Use checking the screenshot for the output of one of its commands. Here, we are not talking about the observe-orient parts of Carnapian or UDA loops. Right? Even even in that most simplistic, most simple task, the causal arrow is reversed where the system decides on the rightness of a task, clicks on a thing, and then justifies itself. This causal arrow is not agency. Nor is it deciding nor is it able to make an appropriate judgment call if if it is proceeded towards its goal. It is able to say whether or not it has succeeded towards what it thinks its steps are, but it is not able to situate itself effectively into reality. And this lack of situation means that it cannot perform as our agent, nor does it have self-agency in determining how to accomplish, accomplishing, and then assessing if a task has been accomplished. Therefore, it is inappropriate to call our current infrastructure agentic. And therefore we can say that AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, is amongst other qualities not articulated here, necessarily goal setting as well as goal following. I would note, however, that an effective goal following system would likely be capable of accomplishing the monetary gains that Microsoft has set as their definition of AGI. Simply by processing or adding more computers. And so therefore, our philosophical basis and our philosophical definitions should be considered a completely disjunct ontology from those being peddled by Silicon Valley. To say this again, for Deep Research to, in fact, be a useful research assistant, it needs a number of components. The first and fundamental is the ability to figure out what the research questions are within the prompt. So, not what the prompt's questions are, but what the fundamental research questions implied by the prompt such that research can be done. Noting that a literature review, if done well, is a persuasive document which situates a text in a literature, identifies the research questions, identifies the context in which the research questions will be answered, and most importantly, identifies the gaps. This requires epistemic humility that these systems flatly do not exhibit. They can certainly play at it, but then playing at epistemic humility is not, in fact, the same as them having it. The performance of a virtue is not having the virtue, which is kind of the whole problem with large language models. So, the first component is for them to look at any stage of output and decide if that stage of output, again, to have judgment, to induce from data the general pattern, they must decide if that output is appropriate within the implied tacit context of the querent's question. If a system, if Deep Research cannot return, 'Ha, I seem to have gone down a blind alley. Let me, can you help clarify some things that I'm confused about so that I can search again?' it's not Deep Research. And now, let me let me be super clear here. We are not saying that it was unable to find things. Right? We're not saying, 'Oh, I didn't get any search results. You're user, hey user, your query is bad'. I'm saying the assumptions that I made in my searching were incorrect. Self-criticality here is essential. Along that line of self-criticality, we must then look at editing. And so when these systems engage in\n\n\n\\section{Section 6 questions}\n\nFrom AI:\n\nFor your walk to work, I'd recommend focusing on **Section 6: Research Tool Design Requirements**. This constructive section needs more specific details about how research tools should be designed to compensate for AI judgment deficiencies.\n\nSpecifically, please elaborate on subsection 6.2 (Research Process Support):\n\n```\n\\subsection{Research Process Support}\n- Stage-based design (literature finding, extraction, etc.)\n- Non-waterfall approach to research flows\n- Structured to-do lists with human checkpoint integration\n- Outline-driven context switching\n- Documentation of decision points\n```\n\nConsider addressing these questions in your dictation:\n\n1. What would an effective stage-based design look like in practice? How should transitions between stages work?\n\n2. You've mentioned that research can't follow a waterfall SDLC - what alternative workflow model would be more appropriate? How would it accommodate iteration and refinement?\n\n3. How exactly should human checkpoints be integrated? At what specific points in the research process is human judgment most critical?\n\n4. How should outline-driven context switching work in practice? How would the system know which sources to load based on outline position?\n\n5. What documentation of decision points would be most valuable for researchers reviewing an AI's process?\n\nThis section bridges your theoretical critique with practical recommendations, making it particularly valuable for the paper's contribution.\n\n\\subsection{Transcripts}\n\n\n'20250318 - section 6.2 part 1.m4a'\n'20250319 - Section 6 .m4a'\n'20250321 - Section 6 -.m4a'\n'20250324 - human judgement.m4a'\n'20250324 - Section 6 q 3.m4a'\n\n\\section*{Question 1: What would an effective stage-based design look like in practice? How should transitions between stages work?}\n\\subsection*{Question 2: You've mentioned that research can't follow a waterfall SDLC - what alternative workflow model would be more appropriate? How would it accommodate iteration and refinement?}\n%Combined Q1 and Q2 as they were answered together in the audio\n\nOkay.\nUh, so to conclude, we can say that the Aristotelian fallacy is that the world doesn't matter.\nThat an AI will never ever look at its words and go, nah, those those weren't good. Let me throw them out instead of giving them to the user.\nAnd it will never say, well, there are two possible courses of action here. Here's what you should be looking for in the world to differentiate between them.\nIt does sometimes say that there's two opposing arguing authorities, but again, this is still the Aristotelian issue is that we can we can acknowledge fighting authorities, we just can't acknowledge an authority being wrong about the world unless it says so. And so it will never say, well, go try this, see if it works, report back. It will never say, well, I can't get that paper. Could you go get it for me?\nAnd so the flaw in judgment is that it always has to deliver a coherent and final answer.\nAnd again, all of this can be circumvented if the human is injecting this into their prompts. And so if we if we cause it, it can certainly perform all of these functions.\nThe proof of this is not does it, can it pretend, can it can it have pretense to these functions. The basis of this is does it act this way in the absence of other stimuli?\nAnd even, even if we push it, does it act appropriately?\nBecause the problem is is that in many of these tests, it can use the words of the thing without engaging in the fact of the thing. But that's another discussion.\nSection six, um questions again. Let's see here.\nYou've mentioned that research can't follow a waterfall SDLC. What alternative workflow model would be more appropriate? How would it accommodate iteration? Fine.\nThis question is the wrong question, fundamentally. It is that deep research {quote} workflows cannot follow waterfall methodology.\nBecause they work out their plan first-drafty [f\u025c\u02d0st dr\u0251\u02d0fti], they collect some amount of data. But they're not like the critique of this is that they are not systematic about the data that they are collecting. It is it is rare it is seldom that the case that the first couple of hits on the topic. Now, again, this may or may not be bubbling up, um, it's probably using a synthetic summary of the hits because we don't necessarily want the search result in the context window. Yet.\nBasically, rather than treating Deep Research as a single train of thought that wanders and hops and skips through the literature, it is something that can be systematic, that can create sub processes that can go out, preferably using the academic's either files or credentials, go find real papers, go use Web of Science, so on and so forth, and then builds a wiki as its reference. Because it is important to have a journal of what worked and what didn't work. The fact that the process of producing these reports is hidden away removes significant amounts of utility and plausibility from these reports. Especially with how naff [n\u00e6f] the the reports are. And so having having a wiki that can be navigated as part of this is fantastic. Obviously, it should be a set of markdown pages that can be committed to a repo. But even even more simply than that, it is a user's personal knowledge repository. Because quite frankly, if they have done a deep research run on one thing, then having the relics of previous runs around to support future runs, if and only if the user judges is appropriate, of course. But having having the the runs of previous or the the wikis of previous runs around is a great way to not hit the same page again and again and again. And so effectively, effectively what we are doing in this stage is building an annotated bibliography of the works consulted, not cited, consulted. An annotated bibliography of works consulted with quotes and discussions of how the quotes are apposite to the research questions and their operationalization.\n\n\\section*{Question 3: How exactly should human checkpoints be integrated? At what specific points in the research process is human judgment most critical?}\n\nUh, the question here, the question here is around most critical. Um.\nAnd I would say that there there are two places where presently human judgment is entirely lacking in the context of Deep Research. The first is on initial search results. And the second is on the writing design. The outline, the the the step before integrating the sources and the structure and the arguments into the user's output. So let's start with the first part. In the first part, it should happen after the AI has compiled its first set of sources by category that it has searched. Because it is seldom that the the case that the first couple of hits on the topic. It is seldom that the case that those first hits are actually the most responsive. So what the stage-based design would look like is fundamentally, the utility of human judgment here besides the fact that that's the point. But the utility of the human judgment is in precedent setting. It is a way of getting further prompts from the user such that we have a better understanding of what it is they desire. There are two places where this is essential. The first is on initial search results. Did it get it? And we need to be, we need to be quite clear here. This is not, is it done? It is more, here are the sections, here are the results that I found. Is this the kind of thing I should be looking for? Effectively, effectively, this is asking the question of, is each category appropriate in degree and or in kind as as an answer for this part of the query? And and if effectively what we are doing here is we're breaking apart the research question into sub-research questions until such time as we have a research question that can plausibly be answered. Sub-research question, sub-sub-research question, whatever. They can be plausibly answered with one or two quite similar queries. Now, whether or not that will be is another question. But effectively what this is doing is is getting the user's judgment as input as to the utility not of the sub-research questions, but of the responsiveness of the literature that's been found to any of those sub-research questions. Now, obviously here, there are opportunities for human judgment even the simplest, 'Do you find this quote persuasive as an answer to this sub-research question?' Yes, no. Right? Like we we don't need to have really complicated outputs. We can just have, 'Hey, am I on the right track?' Yes, no. Obviously, these are precedent-setting. Um, and the user can feel free to start typing long-run answers or what have you. But the other critical place where research questions need to be is in preparing the output. Specifically, putting together the outline to write the answer to. The model makes lovely messy outlines at points if it chooses to. Specifically, the outline, the the the step before integrating the sources and the structure and the arguments into the user's output. Here, we are not talking about the observe-orient parts of Carnapian [k\u0251\u02d0\u02c8ne\u026api\u0259n] or UDA loops [u\u02d0d\u0259 lu\u02d0ps]. Right? Even even in that most simplistic, most simple task, the causal arrow is reversed. where the system decides on the rightness of a task, clicks on a thing, and then justifies itself. This causal arrow is not agency. Nor is it deciding nor is it able to make an appropriate judgment call if if it is proceeded towards its goal. It is able to say whether or not it has succeeded towards what it thinks its steps are, but it is not able to situate itself effectively into reality. And this lack of situation means that it cannot perform as our agent, nor does it have self-agency in determining how to accomplish, accomplishing, and then assessing if a task has been accomplished. Therefore, it is inappropriate to call our current infrastructure agentic. And therefore we can say that AGI, Artificial General Intelligence is amongst other qualities not articulated here, necessarily goal setting as well as goal following. I would note, however, that an effective goal following system would likely be capable of accomplishing the monetary gains that Microsoft has set as their definition of AGI. Simply by processing or adding more computers. And so therefore, our philosophical basis and our philosophical definitions should be considered a completely disjunct ontology from those being peddled by Silicon Valley. To say this again, for Deep Research to, in fact, be a useful research assistant, it needs a number of components. The first and fundamental is the ability to figure out what the research questions are within the prompt. So, not what the prompt's questions are, but what the fundamental research questions implied by the prompt such that research can be done. Noting that a literature review, if done well, is a persuasive document which situates a text in a literature, identifies the research questions, identifies the context in which the research questions will be answered, and most importantly, identifies the gaps. This requires epistemic humility that these systems flatly do not exhibit. They can certainly play at it, but then playing at epistemic humility is not, in fact, the same as them having it. The performance of a virtue is not having the virtue, which is kind of the whole problem with large language models.\n\n\\section*{Question 4: How should outline-driven context switching work in practice? How would the system know which sources to load based on outline position?}\n\nSo, this first stage requires searching. This is not merely task clarification. And the point of this is that at any stage of all of these, we can go back up a stage. We can discover that, oh, our original research question was wrong. We can discover that, oh, there is a part of the literature that we hadn't considered. Um, and so fundamentally, what we are doing at every single possible stage is building, is verifying the research questions through negative inference. And that's actually extremely valuable. And so that's stage one. Stage two is effectively the building out of a plan to answer the user's question. Which again needs to get feedback from the user because is the AI corrigible [\u02c8k\u0252r\u026ad\u0292\u0259bl\u0329]? Not in terms of its final instruction, but in terms of process. This specific part is also a fundamental rejection of technoscholasticism. Do wonder how that word will come through on the transcript. Um, you know what, I'm just going to have to say it two words in the transcript: techno scholasticism. Sure. Um. And so this second phase is a phase of growing many distinct investigative branches and sorting them. So, what works are able to answer what parts of the question? Furthermore, and also throughout all of this, the user must not be passive. Because the most useful thing is to leverage the judgment of the user here. And so there should be throughout all of this confirmations. Is this passage responsive to your question? Is this what you're talking about? The the most important thing is defining the borderline stage of this. Now, obviously, this is multi-threaded. We should not lock on user input. But basically a common sense thread looking at what the user is replying versus what all the sub-agents are working on and going, 'Hey, am I wasting my efforts?' Like what we care about here is identifying cognitive mismatch, but also what we care about is drilling in on what the user is actually asking. And the best way to do that is because we we've already done an operationalization, we've already tried asking the user, is to, well, here is a giant list of sources. Also presented one at a time, because quite frankly, if you present people with a giant list, they won't engage with it. And more to the point, you can really generalize from answers. So, so this stage is going, 'Hey, here's this work, here is this quote. Here is how we think it is responsive to the research question. Is it? Is this useful? Should I use this for background? Should I use this in the final piece? Am I on the right track?' Now, obviously, our goal here in this second, second and a half stage, whatever, is to better calibrate the user's judgment. Effectively, this is a question of corrigibility [k\u0252r\u026ad\u0292\u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u026ati]. Right? Can we correct the AI's operation within this context? So, if we provide the user with, 'Well, here is a draft outline of approximately 10 sections', then we need to get the user's feedback on the degree and the kind and the section ordering of the sub-research questions because we have assumed that it must be responsive to the core research question that was the output of stage one.\n\n\\section*{Question 5: What documentation of decision points would be most valuable for researchers reviewing an AI's process?}\n\nFundamentally, what searches were done, why, what did they result in, what was the evaluation of each result of the search systematically positive and negative, then how was the user's query operationalized into research questions, how were those research questions broken down into smaller and smaller research questions? What precedent did the user set? What conclusions did the model draw from the user's choices? What is the model's operationalization and understanding of the original query? Excellent. And that finishes this.\n\n\n\n\\section{Section 5 Questions}\n\nFor your walk to work, I'd recommend focusing on **Section 6: Research Tool Design Requirements**. This constructive section needs more specific details about how research tools should be designed to compensate for AI judgment deficiencies.\n\nSpecifically, please elaborate on subsection 6.2 (Research Process Support):\n\n```\n\\subsection{Research Process Support}\n- Stage-based design (literature finding, extraction, etc.)\n- Non-waterfall approach to research flows\n- Structured to-do lists with human checkpoint integration\n- Outline-driven context switching\n- Documentation of decision points\n```\n\nConsider addressing these questions in your dictation:\n\n1. What would an effective stage-based design look like in practice? How should transitions between stages work?\n\n2. You've mentioned that research can't follow a waterfall SDLC - what alternative workflow model would be more appropriate? How would it accommodate iteration and refinement?\n\n3. How exactly should human checkpoints be integrated? At what specific points in the research process is human judgment most critical?\n\n4. How should outline-driven context switching work in practice? How would the system know which sources to load based on outline position?\n\n5. What documentation of decision points would be most valuable for researchers reviewing an AI's process?\n\nThis section bridges your theoretical critique with practical recommendations, making it particularly valuable for the paper's contribution.\n\n\\section*{Section 5: Reflective Analysis - Question 1}\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nWhat specific examples from your autoethnographic testing best demonstrate technoscholasticism in action? Can you describe instances where AI tools privileged textual authority over critical assessment?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nOkay.\nSo, the first example of this is when I used OpenAI's Deep Research to gather the literature on Digital Humanities in Australia.\nNow, to be clear, I did this with some malice aforethought. Um. Not least because I had done this research by hand two years ago. And and fundamentally, the flaw with this is that over the last decade, decade and a half, many universities across the world announced a great fanfare a digital humanities major or lab or what have you. Um, as a to-do, make sure that I actually go look in the uh the DH outputs. But they they announce with great fanfare a lab. The problem is, they don't announce when things go fallow. Um. And and so fundamentally, the the picture that Deep Research painted was one of a vibrant digital humanities across many universities. Whereas in many ways, after quite a lot of excitement in the 2010s, it left to go downhill before the pandemic and was basically killed during the pandemic. So, this is a great This is actually a great example of technoscholasticism. Because it fundamentally the these claims are not assessed in any sort of context. That just because the claim is made does not mean that it still holds true in this moment. And so the lack of temporal criticality beyond that, however, yeah, I would say that I have seen no evidence that any models that I have worked with that are that are connected to the web for Deep Research kind of operations are um exhibit non technoscholastic tendencies. Um, I mean, look, the the point of this is it can. Right? There's no effectively judgment.\n\n\\section*{Section 5: Reflective Analysis - Question 2 \\& 3}\n\\subsection*{Question Text 2}\nHow did I observe the AI systems conflating description with insight? What markers distinguish genuine insight from sophisticated description?\n\\subsection*{Question Text 3}\nIn what ways did the AI tools fail to identify true knowledge gaps? They simply aggregated existing views, or did they attempt to highlight contradictions?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nOkay. Um. Section five, question two. How did I observe the AI systems completing description with insight? What markers uh distinguish genuine insight from sophisticated description? And question three, in what ways did the AI tools fail to identify true knowledge gaps? They simply aggregated existing views or did they attempt to highlight contradictions?\nHuh. Okay. Um. No, that's just a really good question. Um. So, fundamentally, this is the summarization problem. Right now, models are very effective at deductive and tautological transformations. So, pointing at my my students annotated bibliography, Claude 3.5 is very effective at saying how a given specific text answers basic questions. So, so so my my try that again. The fundamental thing that I observed in Arts 3500 with my ancient history cohort when they were building annotated bibliographies of 160 all 160 sources talking about Plato's madness was that there was no judgment required, no induction required. Um. The students said, 'Does this source talk about Plato's madness?' If so, what statements does it make? Sort of thing. I'd have to pull from the the the prompts, right? But but we're talking about basic declarative questions, right? We're not claiming what was the point of this piece? We're not saying what was the fundamental insight of the piece. We're saying, 'Are there sentences that match this condition?' And obviously large language models right now can do bidirectional inference. That is description. Insight, however, requires contextualization and tacit knowledge. And again, judgment. Because insight is not, 'How does this paper ask this question?', but 'Is this a useful paper?' And what is the most useful statement of that paper? Because talking about the most useful statement of that paper, we're no longer relying on the claims of the paper, right? The paper has its own opinions about what it thinks is important. And if it is well written, those are well signposted. But not all papers are well written and not all good papers or great papers are well written. And if we're talking about the fundamental insight, then it is one, is this the most appropriate paper to answer this question within the context of the broader literature? It is what is the actual piece of new knowledge contained within this paper, regardless of its claims. It is the pushing back against claims. It is the 'You know what? I disagree.' right? So it is it is looking at all of the necessary formalisms that the paper has to go through and and discarding them and knowing those. Um. It is looking at the intellectual pedigree of the paper. Who are they citing? What is the context of the author? It is looking for context clues in the quality of the journal. It is contextualizing them from those papers that cite it. So insight in many ways requires the tacit knowledge of the surrounding disciplinary context that large language models are so spectacularly bad at. Because large language models are fundamentally credulous. They believe what they are told. And this issue of belief of of is this paper's claim credible and useful within our context that large language models aren't great at? Because this this speaks to um what I'll be getting into in section six, but the the Carnapian confirmation problem. That that Deep Research tries to accumulate evidence until some vibe-based criterion is met. And then that's that. If we presume this to be the case, then we say, okay, Deep Research, find me all articles from this journal that relate to this topic. Now, the difference between this search and Jacob's search is one, this was bounded and well-specified. And quite frankly, a relatively small dataset. These claims are not assessed in any sort of context. Because the corpus is so problematic that Elicit doesn't in fact have a great deal of surface area to work from. And it's it's kind of false flag. The second issue is that Elicit's Deep Research has a textual framing that is limited to 10 papers for that output. And so we we were given a month free, I used it for about an hour and then um ignored it. Um. It operationalized uh uh set of criteria, I just didn't do a very good job of assessing papers against that criteria. Again, it's not specialized for humanities research. Um. But the models that they were using were not very impressive. So elicit's technoscholastic bent the failure mode for elicit encompasses technoscholasticism is that process never ever results in it saying, 'I don't know'. I or I mean, look, and and we can turn that down. We could say, 'Oh, I don't have enough information to to come to this conclusion.' It never it never actually acts upon its notice of deficiencies. It always uses that language of 'Well, what about?' to create more options, and those options can be contrary to the other options. And I have no fundamental issue with this performance of of epistemic humility just like it can engage in the performance of judgment. Its technoscholastic front is that the most useful insight from that paper, were no longer relying on the claims of the paper.\n\n\\section*{Section 5: Reflective Analysis - Question 4}\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nDid you observe any instances where the AI tools appeared to challenge their technoscholastic tendencies? Were there conditions under which they performed better?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nOkay. Um. Section five, question four. Did you observe any instances where the AI tools appeared to challenge their technoscholastic tendencies? Were there conditions under which they performed better? Cool, cool, cool. No. However, we did manage to work around the problem. So I think what's interesting here is not only did we not observe this, but we saw that their own estimations of their own capabilities were woefully badly calibrated. So when we got 01 Pro to flush out the prompts for Deep Research, it made this wonderful seven-step research plan. Wonderful in a bit of quotes there. But like it was it was quite good. It would go find the things and then step, step, step, step, step. After about a week and seven iterations of the prompt, instead, instead what we found that worked was one fraction of step one, which is to say that Deep Research, when given an extremely elaborate single prompt, because of course it doesn't allow for the more effective back and forth. Um, and this single prompt effectively was, go find a comprehensive list of all references to tools such and such and return them in a CSV. That it basically did. Now, there are data quality issues here, severe data quality issues. Um, fairly severe hallucination issues, but it certainly didn't challenge its own tendencies at all. Um, but that's how we worked around it. Um. Which is is maybe have an appendix on on Zendo, right? But like because it couldn't assemble a corpus to search. This approach was fundamentally flawed, and maybe I should I should investigate that. Maybe that's where the problem is. But my critique of the processes that I've seen in Elicit, in OpenAI, in Perplexity, is that they effectively random walk through the tree of possibilities with a vaguely Carnapian confirmatory bias where they they collect evidence until some internal vibe threshold is met, and then that's that. It is rare that the case that a research process is seldom that the case that the first couple of hits on the topic. Gemini 2.5 does not exhibit judgment. But it does exhibit decent inductive capabilities. So, that's nice, I don't like it anyway, we'll figure it out. Um. So, the corpus is bad. Um. It does not have acceptable levels of coverage in the humanities, um, for all sorts of reasons that aren't relevant to this paper. Uh, beyond that though, it tends to act on abstracts rather than full papers. Again, because it doesn't have the the non-abstracts or papers or books or what have you. And the third dimension of this is that its AI-generated TLDR tags no-notable inferences. And so the corpus is so problematic that Elicit doesn't, in fact, have a great deal of surface area to work from, and it's it's kind of false flag. The model may need to be prompted with scheduled tombstones to consider alternate interpretations. This is where prompting can play a massive actual role. But fundamentally, the choice of using anchor text is superior to the use of embedding search for this problem. Must keep in mind the goal and the process, not the output itself. Computer Use honestly struggled to use the computer. Um. It simply wasn't at the level of calling APIs, text gets fitness scholasticism because it couldn't assemble a corpus to search. So if we prove that it can it is responsive, then besides iterating through the outline search, what we should be doing is looking at all and links and interpretations from the referencing document and all inbound links and interpretations to that document. Because because the kind of proleptic argument of following claims forwards and backwards and so on, can be very effective when we're building when we're building these two. So if the system during research should be just building a wiki and fundamentally, it needs to dis- um it needs to figure out when its first draft is unacceptable and when it needs more research. But it also needs to be able to indicate sources in its corpus should not be considered for a draft. It needs more structure. It needs to be able to make outlines and write to the outlines. It needs to have an obvious editing pass. It needs to be a real boy. Cool. Okay. Um, I think that's I think that's that one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'20250325 - Sect 5 q 1.m4a'\n'20250331 sec 5 q 2.m4a'\n'20250401 - Section 5 Question 3 - Literature \u2013 Tuesday at 9-36\u202fam.m4a'\n'20250402 - Section 5 question 4 - Research \u2013 Wednesday at 9-26\u202fam.m4a'\n\n\\section*{Section 3: Methodology - Question 1}\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nWhy is autoethnography particularly appropriate for studying AI research tools? How does it capture dimensions that other methodological approaches might miss?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nOkey dokey. Uh, section three, question one. Why is autoethnography particularly appropriate for studying AI research tools? How does it capture dimensions that other methodological uh practices might miss? This is the wrong question.\nUh.\nOh boy, this is absolutely the wrong question. So, Deep Research is weeks old. When we gained access to it, it was a week old.\nFundamentally, this research about doing research is autoethnographic because a lot of the effective use of AI, especially in research, is vibes based. The utility of this paper, the utility of this project is in me, a philosopher and AI researcher, reflecting on my use of AI to AI, um, for for purposes of research. Like the process that I'm doing right now where I'm getting AI to ask me questions on behalf of the paper is itself part of the research, because I'm seeing how well a paper can be constructed using this approach. I'm evaluating different models. And so, let's be clear. This is hypothesis generating research, right? This is purely qualitative. This is this is meta research. Um. And therefore, for me to do a case study that is at all persuasive, I would either need to do the research and have AI expertise, or I would need to find researchers who had equivalent or better skills in the textual technologies of prompting to do this research with, noting that OpenAI's Deep Research is \\$200 a month. And so why autoethnographic? Well, fundamentally pragmatism, that a an autobiographical account of this is what I was thinking when I was doing the research, I think would lay the foundations quite well for discussing discussing um the the theme of technoscholasticism that I discovered. Do I claim that this is the way the world is? No. But looking at myself, looking at how what other folks consider an expert in AI uses AI for the purposes of research was pragmatically what was possible. And moreover, this would this is an assessment of vibes, right? This is an assessment of the patterns of fundamental capability that observing the tool and understanding the tool and evolving my methodology for using the tool is all part of it. Because even with the defense of of qualitative research, even with the defense of hypothesis generating research, many of these patterns of uh interaction are tacit patterns. They they we recruit researchers with enough time and capability would be tricky. But I think that that is sufficient for effective use cases. And then pulling back comments like this uh is useful where my previous notes fix that the third activity students do badly and give you awesome results that have no bearing on reality. Is that sure, marginal papers or borderline papers, it is far more interesting for the PhD student to read the output models and then to verify and cross-check the output models than simply reading I don't know. Actually prod, um get this, can you, can you engage with some co-pilot argumentation here? Now I see that the the canonical places and it comes back to this one. But I think that that is sufficient for effective use cases.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.2.2: Inductive Reasoning - Question 1}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nHow would you clearly define inductive reasoning in the context of scholarly research? Specifically, distinguish inductive reasoning from mere pattern recognition or predictive capability.\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nUm.\nSub-subsection 2.2.2 question one. How would you clearly define inductive reasoning in the context of scholarly research, specifically research sorry, specifically distinguish inductive reasoning from mere pattern recognition or predictive capacity? I mean, it's in the name. Um.\nSo, we can talk about inductive reasoning for hypothesis generating research, and we can talk about abductive reasoning for hypothesis testing research.\nI mean, let's be clear, inductive reasoning is pattern recognition. Um, this this question is incorrect in many ways.\nBut\nwe can frame it as common sense, we can frame it as pattern recognition, we can frame it as the that's funny moment.\nBut what I would actually frame this as is\nthe noticing of the gaps. So, in the context of scholarly research, inductive reasoning\nis\noh my back.\nOw.\nWhat was I talking about?\nSo, inductive reasoning\nis noticing when the observed facts do not um meet the predictions.\nWait, hold on. No, it's not pattern recognition. Pattern recognition\nUh. Okay. So we can say pattern recognition,\noh, this whole thing is stupid.\nCome on.\nPattern recognition\nah. Pattern recognition is what traditional ML does. Um, it is finding\nclusters of\nobservations of the world. Either the literature or from the mark one eyeball, or from scientific data, or what have you.\nAnd it is the process of grouping.\nInductive reasoning\nis not merely the process of grouping, but the process of articulating a covering rule.\nSo,\nyou use inductive reasoning\nto notice a gap in the literature, articulate a gap in the literature,\nand then turn it into a research question.\nIt is the process of generalization of disparate data, not merely grouping similar data.\nIt has relatively little to do with predictive I mean it is predictive, but\nNo, it's not really predictive. I mean, like obviously it's induction. Induction is predicting because you're making hypotheses, right?\nBut\nYeah.\nThe the prediction side of thing is there is something interesting here and that my effort may pay off.\nYeah, good enough. Um.\n2 2 2 question two, how does the next token prediction architecture fundamentally constrain ability uh LLM's abilities to perform meaning, you know what? I am actually going to do this as a second recording. Cool.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.2.2: Inductive Reasoning - Question 2}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nHow does the \"next-token prediction\" architecture fundamentally constrain LLMs' ability to perform meaningful inductive leaps? Can you illustrate with a concrete example?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nOkey dokey, uh, 222 question two.\nHow does the next token prediction architecture fundamentally constrain LLM's ability to perform meaningful inductive leaps when I always drop it?\nOkay. So,\nSo there there are two fundamental constraints here that have been operant for all of the models that I've seen.\nAnd\nLet's speak about it elsewhere in the paper, but\nit can't\nmove the cursor around\nand it in in terms of its thinking, co-thinking.\nUm\nand it can't delete things. Right? And so\num\nThe requirement here of consistency with predicted tokens\nenforces a level of coherency.\nIt is the difference between narrative and plot. It is the difference between\nexploration and explanation.\nThat\nBasically, it can't disregard\nand\nit can't really build backwards.\nAnd so\nInforces a level of coherency.\nIt can't really explore, can't really build backwards. So,\nThis is this is where constraints in the model and the file and the data that it has access to comes in, right? But\nmost default models are bad.\nAnd\nwhen an LLM writes into its context window\nwhen an LLM writes into its context window,\nthere's no internal noise.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.2.2: Inductive Reasoning - Question 3}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nCould you speak about the importance of the impulse of inquiry in human induction? What precisely are AI systems missing here?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nUm. 222 question three. Could you speak about the importance of the impulse of inquiry in human induction? What precisely are AI systems missing here?\nI mean, the answer is epistemic humility. Um.\nWhich I'm pretty sure\nis the the prior um section. But uh\nIt is the, huh, that's funny. I should poke at that more. Or\nWhere did you get that quote from? Probably meme or probably\nwe'll just search.\nDoes that's a good phrase?\nHuh.\nInk driven systems. What in the world is this?\nUm.\nOkay, well, I should go poke at what O E I S is. Um. Anyways.\nI would describe this as\npeople have used it. Anyways. Um.\nNow, how do I describe this without anthropomorphizing? Because that is, of course, the challenge.\nI mean, the impulse of inquiry is\nto my mind\nliterally noticing that a question could exist.\nIt is the that's funny moment. It is the\nah. It is the noting of discrepancy between world model and facts. It is it is that moment in the Kunian sense\nthat\ncan I mean, it's not really revolutionary science, but right, it is it is the it is the failure to explain the observed facts. Right?\nIt is it is that tension between what we know and what we have\nthat is fundamental to research. It's the well, why do we care about this question? Why why should we ask this question question? Um.\nAnd fundamentally, it is inductive. Well, I mean, we can we can call it abductive. Um.\nBut it is\nIt is a comparison between\ngeneralizing a case over that which is observed versus that which has been described. And realizing that they don't match. Yeah.\nUm. Cool.\nNow, I am sweating.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.2.3: Correspondence with Reality - Question 1}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nClearly define your notion of \"correspondence with reality\" in scholarly research. How does this differ from mere textual coherence or \"truthiness\"?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n223, question one. Clearly define your notion of correspondence with reality in scholarly research. How does this differ from mere textual coherence or truthiness?\nThis very question is good evidence of the need for correspondence with the real.\nUm.\nNo I didn't. Whatever. Um.\nFine. That's good. Okay. So,\ncorrespondence with reality\ndoes not mean textual coherence. It does not mean internal consistency.\nNor does it mean um\ntruthiness. Yes, thank you, good job. Ah.\nRight, so textual consistency. Yes, okay. So,\nCool. So I just made a quick check of textual consistency.\nIt is the ant- it it's not the antithesis, it is the opposite of textual consistency. So textual consistency is an internal coherence of presented fact. Um.\nInside the argument. And and there is the implication that if the article is coherent, then the text is good.\nThis is the fundamental flaw, one of the many fundamental flaws of AI. Um.\nThat\nthere is no world model, there is no outer world, there is no knock on the table. There is merely the words and the sophisticated but still present statistical relationships between words. Um, ooh, uh site my own paper, uh map with no territory. This is absolutely a map with no territory. Um,\nText neighbors for words etcetera. Um thing. Uh Hey Claude, when you get around to reading this, actually, hey, I have a Claude or Jipit when you get around to reading this, remind me to drop in my paper. Um. Yes, of course. Okay. Um.\nSo if it's not textual consistency, we care about truthiness. Well, no.\nAh. It is much better to say that correspondence with reality is an anti-bullshit in the Frankfurt sense. Right? So Frankfurt 2005 on bullshit talks about bullshit as being an indifference to the truth. Um, and then last year's paper Chat Chipin's bullshit, um, speaks to observing these various trends in Chat Chipit. Um.\nWhich perforce Yes, so this is an anti-bullshit requirement where\nwe care about a correspondence with the real, with the real. Because and so if we talk if we're talking about a correspondence with reality as a function of\na non-indifference through the truth,\nit doesn't actually matter if the things are true per se, it matters if there is a\nintention that they could be true. We can we can talk about this in a positivist sense, right? We can talk about this in terms of\nfalsifiable statements, we can do all of that sort of thing, but fundamentally,\nthe correspondence with reality here is\nthe specific and intentional regard for the world the words represent.\nAnd in terms of authority, this is counter to the scholasticism tradition because effectively what we're saying\nis that rather than respecting authority, we must hold authority to account, that authority can be correct, that authority can be wrong, but the arbiter of correctness\nis the real.\nThis isn't really truthiness.\nThis is the necessary prerequisite to truthiness. There we go. I like that.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.2.3: Correspondence with Reality - Question 2}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nHow might the concept of \"Carnapian confirmation\" explain AI's tendency toward superficial validation rather than genuine empirical checks? Can you give an example?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nSection 223, question two.\nHow might the concept of Carnapian confirmation explain AI's tendency towards superficial validation than genuine empirical checks? Can you give an example?\nUh, these questions suck. Okay.\nOkay. So,\nwe have observed\nWe have observed that\ndeep research\nengages in and this is Open AI or Perplexity or what have you.\nEffectively stamp collecting.\nUm\nthat\nI mean, ironically enough, this is the same same behavior that an academic usually behaves in when when finding citations that it's oh, I make a claim, what citation backs up this claim. Um So there's a reason why they're mimicking this academic sin.\nUm\nBut effectively this is So Carnapian confirmation talks about accumulating evidence until something becomes a fact.\nSo we have observed that deep research visits web pages until\nI'm gonna have to anthropomorphize here. It feels confident in\nuntil it feels confident in citing a thing.\nThis is not a tendency towards superficial validation.\nI mean,\nwe we can say that there's no genuine empirical checks because there are no hands.\nBut again, this question is fundamentally wrong. It is not attention towards superficial validation. Also validation is explicitly the wrong word with regards to Carnap as validation is a very specific um term for Carnap. Um\nBut it's because the causal error arrows are wrong.\nThis is the question of historiography. Fundamentally, this is the question that\nan AI seldom in our experience asks.\nQuestions of historiography. It is it seldom asking questions that\nIt is seldom asking questions\nof who is the author of this source, can they know this? What have other people said in regards to this source. So you don't, you don't need to be able to knock on the table. What we need to be able to do is assess the credibility of a source as a function of other literature in tension with and supporting with the original source. So it is the historiographi- historiographical, there we go, assessment of\nthis paper makes this claim, can this paper make this claim?\nIt is specifically not saying this paper makes this claim, therefore the claim that I'm making is true. It is this paper makes this claim, this paper is supported by this surrounding ecosystem of papers. Therefore it is this passage from this paper supports my claim. It is the historiographical assessment, it is the textual assessment of the paper that makes it useful. Um\nSo, the example is the digital humanities uh example that I've used before. Um so, uh Japit, let's say oh three mini, whatever, probably a one, now I'm thinking about it. Set out to do a deep research run. Um and so it found a bunch of Australian research uh universities claiming deep research, claiming um digital humanities. However, it did not look at the dates nor the broader social context of these claims and realizing that these claims are far too old, that these courses have not been updated and that they are unremoved relics of the 2010s rather than a continuing field of scholarship. Cool.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.2.3: Correspondence with Reality - Question 3}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nHow could a genuinely empirical or experimental approach theoretically differ from current AI practices?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n223, question three. How could a genuinely empirical experimental approach theoretically differ?\nExcuse me. Theoretically differ from current AI practices. Um.\nHonestly quite easily and this is this is what I put in in context to my the prior question of the historiographical assessment of source. Does this source, is this source supported? Does this source have, does the author of the source, is it pot- there we go. Is it possible for the author of the source to make the claim? Are they there when they observed it? It is\nYeah. Um It it is the specific contrary assessment of source credibility that would be useful here.\nUm so it is both source credibility but also situating the source in the literature. So\nCan can the source make the claim? How well does the source agree with its literature? Does the method of the source allow it to make the claim? Has it been contradicted? What is the timing of it? Why why is this found when other things aren't found? And I think the the the real flaw with this is contemplating negative space. So, LLMs do very poorly in terms of negative space. They do very poorly in terms of negative inference. And so\nNoticing that a claim made on a web page five years ago, six years ago before the pandemic, is different than a paper written six years ago that might be good is actually quite tricky, especially when the web page may not have a date on it. And so\nEffectively there needs to be a source validation. There needs to be a historiographical assessment of every source before it is incorporated.\nWhich cannot happen in the main context window.\nSo, does the source say what it can say? What are the quotes? What are the page numbers of the quotes? And then to contextualize the source within the broader literature, but also within the activities of the real such that we think that it still maintains co- a correspondence with the real during the time when the search is done rather than reflecting a prior and no longer relevant correspondence. So there's a temporality awareness as well as a context awareness as well as an author awareness as well as a literature awareness that this sort of scholastic assessment of credibility of source is fundamental to the textual humanities disciplines. Awesome.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 1}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nExplicitly outline your understanding of a literature review as a persuasive rather than descriptive task. Could you unpack this difference in more detail?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n2.3 question one.\nExplicitly outline your understanding of a literature review as a persuasive rather than descriptive task. Could you unpack this difference in more detail?\nOh my god.\nOkay. A literature review fundamentally does two things. One, fundamentally, it situates whatever we're writing within the context of the literature.\nRight? So,\nliterature says this is the jargon, here's the research that came before and so on and so forth.\nYou would think that that would be descriptive. That is false. It's informative, but the literature review\nfor purposes of any research task is fundamentally persuasive. Because it is the evidence that warrants the claim of and therefore this paper makes the following claims.\nRight? It is not it is not descriptive in its own guise. Its utility is not It's not an annotated bibliography.\nMoreover, the literature review, besides situating the research in a broader context, introducing whatever frame you want, how how how you're approaching the problem, has to do two things. One, why has no one else or sorry, to demonstrate that no one else has solved this problem.\nThis is an inductive step. Right? This is to say here is all the surrounding literature of the problem, but what I am about to write is novel, pay attention. Now, to be clear, all these purposes are not simply meant for academic discourse.\nBut when you talk about research for purposes of business, the literature review has an even more pointed persuasive task. It is to offer evidence in support or against some claim.\nAnd so therefore, being able to evaluate and situate the evidence in relation to the claim is essential.\nBut even\nSo it's informational, right? It is situational.\nBut the informative nature serves a broader purpose. And it is to serve as evidence for some argument.\nA literature review is not a search.\nAnd now, take it back. So,\nFundamentally, a literature review must make the case of why does this evident evidence support this claim? Why should we, the reader, care?\nUm even when it's delivering the evidence, even when the point of it is purely to situate and deliver evidence, there is that persuasive line that must go beyond simple summarization. Cool.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 2}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nHow exactly does judgment function in the act of selecting and organizing literature to establish scholarly novelty?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n2.3 question two. How exactly does judgment function in the act of selecting and organizing literature to establish scholarly novelty?\nFundamentally, this is the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, right?\nUm.\nBasically by\nby describing\nThis is where situating ourselves in literature is so important because if we say where we are, then that is evidence that we have done the necessary work around where we are to say that no one else has had this position. And so we prove novelty by providing context. The trick is this is a persuasive game as per my prior um discussions. This is a persuasive game\nwhere if we use the right language, if we show an awareness of recent publications, if we show an awareness of the web of scholarship that supports If if we so shown awareness of the web of scholarship that supports the people that we are citing, then then we can say within this literature, within this discipline, no one else is talking about. It means that there is assurance in jargon in Shibboleths in context. And because we have evidence that we have situated ourselves in a particular position, then people are aware of the literature in the discipline can accept our claim for novelty.\nNow, where does judgment come in? Honestly, this is more model of mind of mine, but judgment is is part of it. Because what we're talking about is what do what in our opinion, judgment, will our peers find persuasive? Because the thing is is that we can dress up a bad literature review in exactly the same language as we dress up a good literature review. The quality of the language, the quality of the framing would be about the same. But absent judgment, the literature review will be deficient.\n\n\\section*{Section 2.3: Nature of Research Work - Question 3}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nDescribe the intellectual act involved in situating a research problem within scholarly traditions. Why can't AI adequately perform this act currently?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nUh, 2.3, question three. Describe the intellectual act involved in situating a research problem within scholarly traditions. Why can't AI perform this act currently? Patience really. Um.\nThis is this isn't a failure of model. Um this is a failure of programming. So,\nliterally all that's required of this is having a to-do list. Um having your tasks and and iterating through your tasks and being systematic with it. Um.\nThis is actually the easiest of all the questions where it is step one, make sure you're using the right words, which is mostly difficult when the user's request isn't using the right words. So it is figuring out what disciplines speak to the user's request, and let's be clear, this this applies beyond the academic as well. So,\nthe user says something and the AI needs to figure out what disciplines, academic or technical or even shopping, can answer it, operationalize it, and then read the literature. Um.\nSo this the the read the literature part is the hard part. Um. Because effectively, this is going well, what papers? You know, it's first search and so here search is a problem because we don't have good access to books or journals. Um, Semantic Scholar does not count. Um.\nBut it then needs to go, 'Cool, these these things are speaking to my disciplines, these things are speaking to my topic'. What are the direct reference? What are the indirect reference? And it just needs to follow the scholarly graph. Um. There is an element of judgment here in the question operationalization, but we've covered that before. Um. A lot of this is social and programming problems. So, when it's following the literature, um if it doesn't have access to a paper, it needs to prompt the user to get access to the paper. When it's following literature, it needs to be systematic in following the literature. It can't just go, 'Oh well, I've collected enough evidence'. That can happen afterwards. Like, our our issue here\nis not that it isn't capable of this.\nOkay, where I got off.\nUm So fundamentally this is to do this. What's the question? Situate. Honestly, it is go build an annotated bibliography. The the place where I am not confident\nis if it can discard sources.\nRight? Effectively it is go search, find papers, ask the user for papers that it doesn't have access to, involve the user in the research effectively. Um, all the other discussion that I've had around being involved in an argument for this. Uh. And fan out in the literature, look at the citations, build an annotated bibliography. Honestly building a .bib file would probably be the best way to do this. Um pulling out quotes that it can paraphrase, but being systematic about it. So, so it needs to to to\nI mean look, this is going to be bouncing back and forth between my own thoughts. But effectively, it is it needs to be able to demonstrate to the user that what field their question belongs in, like discipline question, who in that field is talking about it, who their antecedents were, and the citations out until at least the second generation, probably the third. It needs to read all of them, needs to build an annotated bibliography, and then have quotes about the annotated bibliography. So just needs patience really, and that's a matter of programming and and that's the hard bit. But, we we've covered that.\n\n\\section*{Section 3.2: Tool Selection Criteria - Question 1}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nCan you clearly list and justify the criteria used to select which AI tools were tested in your research? Which specific factors (technical, commercial, epistemological) influenced your choices?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n3.2 question one. Can you clearly list and justify the criteria used to select which AI tools were tested in your research?\nUm what we had access to, what we heard people talking about in February 2025.\nSo, we focused on OpenAI's announcement because OpenAI's announcement is clearly the most effective of all of them. Uh, Perplexity announced their imitation copycat in use that. Elicit announced their imitation copycat in use that. Google um didn't really make a needle, but we tried it. Um As of talking in April, Anthropic just announced research, but it's not available to us. So, it's literally just what we had access to.\nUm and I mean, more more prosaically, it is what people online were talking about. Right? So, so if when reading Williamson, when reading Chu, when reading this, when reading um Mueller, if they talked about it in the first quarter of this year, I tested.\nAnd more to the point, it's also me observing which ones I reach for when I do subsequent research. Um most of that's OpenAI.\n\n\\section*{Section 3.2: Tool Selection Criteria - Question 2}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nHow might your selection criteria shape the limitations or potential biases of your conclusions?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n3.2 question two. How might your selection criteria shape the limitations or potential biases of your conclusions? Oh, quite a lot. Um, this is the fundamental failing of autoethnography, right? This is also the fundamental failing of trying to write a paper where literally between the starting of these recordings and where I am right now, what's available to me and their capacity has changed. Trying to hit a moving target. And so, effectively, this is the fruit on hand, right? We we're we're looking at what we have, we're not making comparisons between other techniques, other technologies, other analysis to everything that I have access to because my critiques are not based in the particular programming approach of one over the other, although I can certainly make those. My critiques are based in the fundamental capabilities of large language models. Um beyond that, my biases are academic. Uh beyond that, my biases are philosophical and from the humanities. But it's purely on.\n\n\\section*{Section 3.3: Research Tasks Investigated - Question 1}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nBeyond literature reviews, explicitly define and describe all research tasks you tested AI systems on. For instance, detail tasks like \"source analysis,\" \"data collection,\" and \"knowledge synthesis.\"\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nSection 3.3, question one. Beyond literature reviews, explicitly define all What? Beyond literature reviews, explicitly define and describe all research tasks you tested AI systems on. For instance, detail tasks like source analysis, data collection, and knowledge synthesis.\nOkay. No, that that is a fair question. Don't like it, but it's a fair question. Um.\nSo, this is specifically in regards to deep research workflows.\nFundamentally, we found the most use, not the question, the question. The question is describe all the workflows. Okay, so we did um very well operationalized literature reviews. We did a great deal, so over 150 or so. Um, how would I describe that? structured searching? I mean it used deep research infrastructure. I would say data collection. specifically structured data collection. So go out and search, uh what we asked it for was go find the\ngo find the quote No. For a given tool specified, find all references to it, and then articulate them by year. So this is this is in terms of our actual research, which was software longevity. Um, I mean, toy examples like what hotel should I stay in. Um, pretty sure I did uh a cooking shopping example. I wasn't that impressed. Um, data, it's not cleansing, it's not really elaboration. What did I say? Enrichment, data enrichment. So I used um Hugging Faces' open deep research infrastructure to iterate over uh the open archaeo CSV of tools and enrich them. Um. Certainly didn't do knowledge synthesis or source analysis. Well, I mean, okay, then but we can also, so another task that I did was business case generation, that's the digital humanities example that I've used that I've alluded to a number of times. Um, which wasn't academic research so much as uh making a basically a briefing on a topic. Um, preparatory literature reviews. So like, what is the jargon around the topic? Not so much that that the with the idea that the literature review is useful, but that it was a useful briefing uh to to jump start. Um. But yes, actually, great question. Uh, with Elicit, I only did lit reviews. Uh, with Perplexity, I have Nope, that's not right. Uh, um. So this was an interesting one. Um, just the other day, I asked it to think to synthesize information on how to do a task. Um, specifically around getting rid of a lot of of uh adware on a fresh install of Windows 11. It did not impress me. Uh, Perplexity impressed me even less though. I mean, I say that, I still used What was the question? Oh, cool. Yeah, so that that is in fact the a good example of a failure. Um. Now, I didn't use it for that task.\nWhat? Cool. Yeah, that was the question. Um, that's it.\n\n\\section*{Section 3.3: Research Tasks Investigated - Question 2}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nWhy were these tasks specifically chosen to evaluate the judgment capabilities of AI tools?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nSection 3.3, question two. Why were these tasks specifically chosen to evaluate the judgment capabilities of AI tools? Wrong question. These were chosen to evaluate deep research. So, my critique is that AI lacks judgment. I've evaluated this with a number of uh benchmarks, so my induction benchmarks, so on and so forth. But my critique of the output of these deep research runs is that they are quite solid on deductive uh synthesis, um but fundamentally lack judgment. So, these tasks, these tasks weren't chosen to evaluate judgment. These were uh chosen to evaluate how well things like deep research can actually help with research TM. And so the rest of my paper is a critique on these things genuinely helping with my research. I'll repeat the prior answer.\n\n\\section*{Section 3.4: Evaluation Framework - Question 1}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nWhat specific \"judgment application points\" did you identify during your evaluation? Clearly specify where human judgment intersects with AI workflow.\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nQuestion, what specific judgment application points did you identify during your evaluation? Ah, during your evaluation. Clearly specify where human judgment intersects with AI workflow. So this is not my questions and questions in in sections five and six where it's what it should be. This is the question of what it is. That's a lot harder.\nSo, in terms of judgment,\nthe fundamental judgment here is what tool, what service, what interface, and what modality of use? That's the same thing. What service? So, chatgpt.com, the API, etcetera. What interface? Do I click deep research? Um, do I do I engage all the various levers that have have become exposed? What model? Do I use JPT 4.5 as my supporting model? Do I use um O3 mini high? Do I use O1 Pro? And then above all else, how do I structure my prompt? When an AI is going to go run for 10 minutes, the quality of my prompt matters to a remarkably larger degree than the quality of my prompt normally, mostly because it it wastes my time. And so, the the two, I mean, there there are three, right? What do you reach for? What tool do you reach for? Um And I use tool in in the service plus um interfaces plus model sense. What do you decide to put in your prompt? And then fundamentally, do you accept the the output? And so, to degree, we can rely on the post facto um thoughts as exhibited by AI. Although they do remarkably poor job of exercising the human's judgment. Sorry, they do a remarkably poor job of of exercising the human's judgment. Um Because while they like no, that's not true. The thoughts are there to tell you if your prompt is bad. Not if\nCool, got cut off, but finish that thought. Um, so yeah, and and that was an audit line. And then fundamentally, the judgment of does this prompt do what I wanted it to do? So in many ways, it's the exact same um series of judgment application points as as the normal. Uh it's just it was it's a lot more expensive.\n\n\\section*{Section 3.4: Evaluation Framework - Question 2}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\nDefine explicitly your \"success criteria\" for evaluating AI assistance in research. How did you decide when a task was performed \"successfully\" versus when it failed?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\nSection 3.4, question two. Define explicitly your success criteria. I know it when I see it. Like, All of this is vibes. It's all vibes.\nSo, I was looking for uh, I was looking for quality of answer, I was looking for comprehensiveness of search, I was looking for integration of sources, and I was looking for noticing the gaps. And, I mean, fundamentally, these things describe, that's not a surprise. Which is why,\nIt is the aesthetic judgment of utility. So, above all else, when I look at the answers from AI, the fundamental metric, that's not a metric. The fundamental assessment that I make is, is this useful? Was this worth my time? Did this tool provide me with mundane utility? Success and failure is not a binary. There's never a perfect success. There are absolute failures. Um, I mean, there could be a perfect success where it is brain outside brain full exocortex AGI magic full up dirt nap. But that's not where we're at. Yeah, that's easy.\n</transcripts>\n\nYeah, ask question 1."

Uh not quite sure what you mean by 3.2.\n**Colleague:** Basically, what what AIs did we choose and why?\n**Philosopher:** Why. Okay.\n**Colleague:** And I mean honestly, these aren't subsections. Um.\n**Philosopher:** Right.\n**Colleague:** These are paragraphs.\n**Philosopher:** Right.\n**Colleague:** Um. Yeah. And and and we chose all of them. Why? Because we have grant money. Um, but you don't say that. Uh. Right? But like. Okay, so, so then what I do is I go um on section methodology to review blah and then match my register. Um. So, then I'm going to My and I are going to have a conversation where we talk about each question and the objective is for you to take the current outline or even that the entire section which is always supposed to be about finding words and and through asking us questions turn it into a paragraph by paragraph outline where we figure out the main claims points and evidence of each paragraph. Oh this Then, great. So that that's this is the standard vibe that I'm I'm I I use.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Um. Yeah. No. And I\n**Philosopher:** Turn on the extended thinking definitely.\n**Colleague:** So so we're using O3 so I'm going to turn on extended thinking. There are strong arguments to be thoughtful about this choice. Um\n**Philosopher:** Oh in Claude in Claude or more generally?\n**Colleague:** In general. Um.\n**Philosopher:** Uh-huh. I oh I usually do throw like uh in Claude I when I'm doing stuff like this I usually throw the um in the writing style I I switch it to formal and I find a slight improve like\n**Colleague:** Yeah. I mean it it's\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. low cost and seems to make a slight\n**Colleague:** Well so so that's where we actually have to that's where you can pay attention to writing your own system prompt.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Um so now with all of these things what you have to do is you have to say paper. And we're not going to use Gemini because it's a jerk. Um. And it's going to transcribe that which is fascinating. Um. And then we want Uh Cool. So. The what I find to be actually a lot more useful is doing this with two models because they ask different questions.\n**Philosopher:** Okay. Okay.\n**Colleague:** Um, so this invocation is the um think through it step by step that that I've found does what I want it to do. Mhm. Um yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Great. And then it has a bloody pointed question which is the whole point.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** And now Ugh. I don't know what it is but it's just like your word choice O3 it sucks. What is this garbage?\n**Philosopher:** Huh. Yeah eh eh I don't know.\n**Colleague:** What is this garbage? Like\n**Philosopher:** It does it it it does act like everything's corporate marketing. Accelerate clarity.\n**Colleague:** Exactly does. Okay.\n**Philosopher:** It was um yeah. I I I found it very useful for like writing a headline of uh for a press release but you know otherwise it's annoying.\n**Colleague:** God this is. Like whatever they've trained O3 it's not good.\n**Philosopher:** You want to try you want to try 4.5 instead?\n**Colleague:** No no no we're trying O3 like this is now research. Um it's just\n**Philosopher:** Just doing that comparison between the the wording used in O3 and and Claude would be yeah is\n**Colleague:** Yeah um interesting but. I mean honest okay so so no let let's be fair it it's complaining about not getting the transcript so we're going to give it its transcripts. The fact that it's um Fudd. Okay so as that's going let's talk uh to uh Claude's task. So. Okay. What specific meth- question one. What specific methodological justification underlies your choice of autoethnography as the primary investigative approach for studying AI research tools especially given potential critiques of subjectivity in this method?\n**Philosopher:** Uh-huh. We know it when we see it. Um we are researchers doing research. We have a decade of experience in digital humanities and building tools.\n**Colleague:** You gotta update that it's up to like fif- almost uh almost 15 years now.\n**Philosopher:** Stop helping.\n**Colleague:** Because we're getting old. uh but\n**Philosopher:** Oh my god stop helping. Right so like we have we have 15 years each of experience in building software tools. If not us who? And the critiques of subjectivity like good So so this this oh my god this is my critique of of all those studies where it's like oh well we asked we asked the survey questions it's like well no you actually have to get your hands dirty this is this is Latour in the lab. This is what's actually going on and what are we Yeah it's a case study it's uh a case study by uh you know researchers with extensive experience in digital humanities and tool construction you know uh and um uh and socio-technical research I mean we've done socio-technical research and we can kind of guess what people are going to say if we ask them questions anyway no it's\n**Colleague:** Yeah and and that's the thing is is we don't have the ability to sit with other people and watch them build a research paper.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Like at the end of the day for us to gain the insight insights in this paper we have to be working on our other paper.\n**Philosopher:** Right. So this is I I guess the the last thing that I'd add to that is that um that I think is worth pointing out anyway that um and I I I'm sure we could probably ask uh O3 or someone to find the reference but um uh uptake of uh large language models is extremely limited in history and there just aren't that many people in you know particularly your position where you've been intensively using the LLM for you know since twenty since late 2022 and you know uh so we're in uh you know between us between the our our digital humanities experience experience building building tools um you know uh experience with LLMs if you wanted to throw something in from my side experience working across the you know research sector in leadership positions at the university and national level you know that that we're well we are well placed to do a critical evaluation. Oh and your background in uh the history and philosophy of science. You know between those things we're well placed to do\n**Colleague:** And even more to the point I'm good at prompting. It's an art. Like the fact that I words good with with AI actually matters.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah and I I I think I draw that out by saying you know that what we wanted to do was really explore the frontier here like you know use the use the latest models use you know the premium paid versions of the latest models use the APIs and not have bad prompting get in the way. Yes. So yeah that's I I think that's you know very good for the you know for the justification.\n**Colleague:** Yep. And so therefore we get to interrogate our own thoughts and our own observations as we build the research paper and that's an autoethnographic case study. We're not generalizing we're not saying that we're revealing any truths but also as we've written this three new models with new capabilities have come out so good luck doing a study.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Cool. All right. Open AI uh O3's question. What single declarative claim should the opening paragraph advance to justify an autoethnographic approach as a credible mode of evaluating AI research tools and what? And which two concrete episodes from your February March audio logs most persuasively substantiate that claim? What the fuck is this asking?\n**Philosopher:** I mean the the the first half of that question is what we've just um\n**Colleague:** Yeah no we've answered this question.\n**Philosopher:** answered. And\n**Colleague:** But the second part\n**Philosopher:** I don't really see the\n**Colleague:** That doesn't matter because my audio logs are just answering questions.\n**Philosopher:** Right like I don't see\n**Colleague:** Yeah no that this is this is a bad question.\n**Philosopher:** Right now now because what to justify to answer Claude's version to justify author or you know in the face of claims of subjectivity is we recognize the subjectivity. Here's why we think a subjective case study is appropriate that we do is is valuable.\n**Colleague:** Yeah. All right cool. And now we hit stop recording."

What documentation methods did you employ beyond audio recordings, and how did you ensure analytical rigor despite the acknowledged subjectivity of your approach?\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n\n**Philosopher:** Cool. What did Can I see what did Claude say? When you when you\n**Colleague:** Yeah. So, could you elaborate on how you structured your autoethnographic investigation specifically? What documentation methods did you employ beyond audio recordings and how did you ensure analytical rigor despite the acknowledged subjectivity of our approach? Uh, moo, unasked the question. This is subjective. We interrogated our own experiences by getting AI to ask us questions. Um, so the audio recordings were of me answering AI questions. And I mean, if if we're going to talk about that as rigor, that is a mind outside mind. Like, basically, it is a self-interview technique.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Um, which is weird and not what I was anticipating answering at the start of the sentence, but insofar as I was treating myself as the subject, I was getting the AI to ask me questions around this paper to elicit my thoughts. And so there is no analytical rigor. It is full subjective subjective. What we care about is being persuasive because we demonstrate the the proper research mode. So there this isn't this isn't a qualitative um or quantitative analysis and there is no rigor. This is our experiences that are interesting and insightful.\n**Philosopher:** Yep.\n**Colleague:** Grumble. Um. But then yeah, and then it's also sorry.\n**Philosopher:** Should you be should you be recording this so that you can\n**Colleague:** Oh no, I am recording this.\n**Philosopher:** Good. Okay, cool.\n**Colleague:** Yeah, no no. Like that yeah. Um, and then, and then the other thing is is that because there's two of us, being forced to explain our thoughts to the other who's going through the same experiences means that there has to be almost an intersubjective agreement between us that yes, these claims are worth making. Mhm.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah, no, I think that sounds that sounds really good.\n**Colleague:** It's an intersubjective vibe agreement, right? Did we both have the same vibe using these tools? Yes. Can we communicate the thoughts of our vibe? Yes. Is there any rigor in this? No. Cool.\n\n\\section*{Section 3: Methodology - Question 3}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\n\n\\subsubsection*{q3 o3}\nWhich three selection criteria (rank-ordered) best explain why you focused on OpenAI Deep Research, Perplexity, Elicit, and Hugging Face\u2019s Open Deep Research\u2014and what is the strongest counter-argument someone might raise about this sampling? Please give each criterion a one-clause justification (\u201cbecause \u2026\u201d) so we can weave them directly into the paragraph.\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n\n**Colleague:** All right. Um. Okay, so at least it's going to proleptics. So, which three selection criteria? Why is O3 so obsessed with whatever? Uh which three uh selection criteria rank ordered? Oh my god. Best explain why you focused on OpenAI Deep Research, Perplexity, Elicit, Hugging Faces Open Deep Research? And what's the strongest counter argument someone might raise about the sampling? Please give each criterion a one clause justification. These are all the products on the market.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. No, I mean and we did use different I guess we should specify that we did different things with different products that we wanted to compare like for lit review we wanted to compare perplexity, elicit, you know, and the you know the open yeah. And you know, but then for um, for the other thing the like elicit and perplexity failed so badly at those things that we didn't bother trying to use them to like find instances of the tools that that you know, that deep deep research and hug and the open deep research are the ones that were good for for, you know, um\n**Colleague:** Data collection.\n**Philosopher:** If for data collection. Um. And then for for ideation, we we used the frontier models. We used Claude 3.7 and you know, Chat GPT.\n**Colleague:** And the variation of OpenAI's models that change by the day.\n**Philosopher:** Right.\n**Colleague:** Um, so no, it's like it's availability. It is what services were offered by by either the publishers of frontier models or companies that have established track records.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** I I think I tried very briefly something in Scholar OS and was not impressed. Because at the end of the day, most of the secondary companies just scrape semantic scholar. It's it's boring. We also evaluated computer use I had hiccups this is great. We evaluated computer use, um, Claude's computer use, uh OpenAI's operator. Oh we should poke operator again to see if it's any good.\n**Philosopher:** It wasn't very good the last time.\n**Colleague:** Yeah, it wasn't persuasive. But like basically, we ran an initial test of is this at all worth our time. The only ones that came back with anything worth our time was OpenAI's deep research and um\n**Philosopher:** The Hugging Face open\n**Colleague:** The Hugging Face one. Um, mostly because the others just aren't aren't um\n**Philosopher:** Yeah, and I mean and I have I've I've tagged those in I I'm I'm mostly done. I got a few left, but I've tagged most of them in Zotero to show what you know, which which um model found what. And you know the vast majority of the um the vast majority of the sources that we use that that I found for the paper were found with uh deep research uh compared to the you know compared to the other if we're talking about the lit review. Um that elicit and perplexity added very little uh to the lit review. Um and honestly in this, I think in other in other topics, I think I could have done uh better in um like Scopus and uh Google Scholar. But but this particular topic, I found particularly uh Scopus and what's the other one uh Web of Science like were not very good at surfacing um you know things on tool use on like uh tool longevity uh that I I try and I've got the I've saved the queries that I did that show that like deep research was actually quite good at this uh as far as the lit the lit search goes.\n**Colleague:** Yeah. And I mean like the the point that we're making is is that this was just this is this was us answering the question um with what was available.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. And one thing that I think we should probably highlight is that we did uh disaggregate the research project into these different things. Like data set, you know, data set creation, uh you know, uh lit review, and then the ideation and writing process.\n**Colleague:** Yeah. Okay, so this is actually important. Uh, our Fames account has Gemini Advanced with Deep Research with 25 Pro. Mhm. So, I am going to um drop in our our prompt um that we've done just because\n**Philosopher:** Before you do that just uh thing. In the for the sake of like closing off this paper and getting it published as quickly as we can, do we just want to call it with the February models for the data cre- collection?\n**Colleague:** I mean honestly, I I want to make sure that um uh the model like I want to make sure that deep research that Gemini's deep research um doesn't um have any astonishing capabilities here.\n**Philosopher:** Uh Have you I guess if we do that we should probably also uh are you paying the $200 yet for uh Claude uh like\n**Colleague:** I I am using well the 100 but I haven't used their research yet. On like I'm I'm only doing Gemini Advanced because it's here.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Um. And if I get access to Claude then I will I will do it there. But um\n**Philosopher:** Yeah because Claude's got their deep research thing too.\n**Colleague:** And and that's the thing is as we go new products will come and honestly unless there will be a extremely persuasive like the reason why I haven't bothered with Gemini is that it's It's not systematic, right? Like I'm looking at this and it did a it did a uh task deconstruction which is great. And then it did a web search using Google which surfaces the usual suspects. Um but it's not iterating. Mhm. Um and so honestly until a major new product is announced that's really good Mhm. And that's kind of why we have to get this paper done. But yeah, so so effectively this is use everything, make sure that we're on top of the latest releases until such time as it's time to write. We started writing what? A month ago?\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Yeah. Um. So yeah, like it looks like Gemini 25 Pro Deep Research is going to be pretty good. Do we have our in our data Do we have Fames in our data set? is actually the question.\n**Philosopher:** Uh yeah, we did. We did get we we that was uh so\n**Colleague:** So, it picked up so uh uh 01 deep research picked up the start in 2012, the e-Research conference in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023. Yeah. So, eh. So so 01 did a it did exactly what we wanted it to do.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Um and it looks like looks like uh Gemini Deep Research is retreding the exact same ground. And so the the point that we're making is how do these tools capabilities change? Mhm. Um rather than like there is a clear gulf of capability beyond between OpenAI's deep research and perplexity's deep research.\n**Philosopher:** Right. Perplexity and elicit are nowhere you know just\n**Colleague:** Yeah, they're just nowhere close. Um and and Google is catching up but it is catching up which means that our insights into deep research are um good enough. Like I I basically\n**Philosopher:** Yeah I guess a good tradeoff here is probably going to be to uh run so we've got um Open open AI deep research, we've got Fames there. You run like you're doing now, you run Gemini on Fames and you run Claude deep research on Fames.\n**Colleague:** And I will\n**Philosopher:** And you and you just show and you show them side by side in a table.\n**Colleague:** Oh that's actually quite good yes. Um.\n**Philosopher:** And and you know if it's like what we think it's going to be they're going to be very similar and you say look these these are all at we're not there's no order of magnitude difference between any of these. They're all roughly the same so we're going to focus the rest of this paper on um you know on or this discussion on OpenAI deep research uh because it was it was available first and we used it.\n**Colleague:** Yeah and like if if there's no difference in kind like there's certainly going to be difference in degree but there's no difference in kind between uh OpenAI deep research and well actually we don't know because it's still crunching along. Yeah. Um but like yeah I I think a table here is just right. Um assuming that Claude research comes through because that's of course its its own assumption. Yeah. Yeah. No and and hey that means we get to cite all the Fames stuff one last time.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Woo. Um. Although the like the point that we're going to make is what did it miss? Mm. Um. Because\n**Philosopher:** Yeah and I mean we should we we we probably should like uh you know put uh I mean I can pretty quickly generate you know the bibliography of all publications related to Fames but we have it it's in Zotero I think. And uh you know and say well you know even just looking at our paper we could do the we could do the articles and a selection of um like uh high higher profile conference presentations and say here's the Well there's the blog post right? Like we can we can just say what years were we active based on our own knowledge and we have a four column table.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Um. Yeah okay. Cool. Um that was actually a useful digression.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah I think that could be very powerful to have here is the master data set of what we know about our own project and here's deep here's OpenAI Google and and Anthropic's views of that like uh you know their results on that.\n**Colleague:** Yeah. And what's the strongest counter argument? Um well we're money bags because we're spending hundreds of dollars a month. And the answer is yeah it'd be nice if it was cheaper. Um. Yeah. And what other counter arguments would there be? Well what about this tool that I've just invented? Yeah this is moving week by week. We're not going to catch everything. We're trying to catch things that are mentioned by those This is a snapshot looking it's a snapshot in time. We know things are moving but you can't let that stop you doing the the research. You know um because many of these lessons are going to be valuable for few as tools become more capable.\n**Colleague:** And this paper generalizes. Just because we're making a critique of deep research doesn't mean that this hasn't been founded on the last however many weeks since four uh Bing Sydney released.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Um. Oh I'm going to be so All right yeah that's good. And we don't actually need the answer to whether or not Gemini advanced is at all good. But yeah um Fames us has Gemini advanced so that's something we should remember.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** All right. And stop recording."

            "Here's our answer to the last questions posed\n\n\\section*{Section 3: Methodology - Question 3}\n\n\\subsection*{Question Text}\n\n\\subsubsection*{q3 Claude}\nWhat specific research tasks did you systematically evaluate these tools on, and what were your primary evaluation criteria for success or failure in each task?\n\n\\subsubsection*{q3 o3}\nFrom the full set of activities you tried (literature discovery, data-set creation, annotated-bibliography building, ideation/drafting, etc.), which three tasks most clearly stress-tested the models\u2019 alleged research judgment\u2014and, for each task, what single observable indicator did you treat as \u201csuccess or failure\u201d? Please answer in the triad format below (substituting task and indicator names): 1. Task: \\textit{specific research task} / Indicator: \\textit{success/failure metric} 2. Task: \\textit{specific research task} / Indicator: \\textit{success/failure metric} 3. Task: \\textit{specific research task} / Indicator: \\textit{success/failure metric}\n\n\\subsection*{Transcription}\n\n**Colleague:** So yeah, so like I fed it the exact same prompt. That prompt went through seven iterations. The default expectations of Gemini Deep Research didn't achieve the outcome.\n**Philosopher:** Okay, so you got a report and not uh not data.\n**Colleague:** Yeah, the table in the middle of the report is good. Like it hits all of our dates including Fames 1.0 release in 2014, which nothing else and it noticed that the grant was was like the data quality is good. Um. Oh.\n**Philosopher:** Can you show me the table? Can you put get show me what you're looking at?\n**Colleague:** I generate I don't know how to share. You know what? Uh export to docs. Uh Bueler? Loading. Loading.\n**Philosopher:** Loading.\n**Colleague:** Loading. Okay, now I have to find the window with you. Here, I'm just gonna Okay wait a sec something pinged something's happening it's\n**Colleague:** So it made a 20 page report. Oh my god. Anyways.\n**Philosopher:** Which it now want now Gemini is offering to me to summarize it.\n**Colleague:** Uh yeah, it's so stupid.\n**Philosopher:** Okay. But even the table, it's like it's not really\n**Colleague:** It wasn't what we asked for.\n**Philosopher:** It's not data, it's not data the way that the other thing the other things are data.\n**Colleague:** The other ones gave us what we asked for. This didn't.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Um. And thus we have evidence about why we ignore Gemini. Like it's because our expertise says that it's it's kind of shit really.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. There's some good some of this report looks a little like slop but some of it's actually I mean it is pretty impressive.\n**Colleague:** Yeah like Gemini is not bad. It's just\n**Philosopher:** Not what we want because we're try not that that the task the task was make help us make a data set.\n**Colleague:** Yes. And it\n**Philosopher:** And it it just yeah. It just failed. Yes.\n**Colleague:** Um, do we want one more of these? Um. Because it's 8:30 right now.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah, I'm I'm gonna uh I think we probably got a lot to uh some things that we want that Oh did you want to so research tasks investigated? Oh that's where we go through how we disaggregated the research process. Um you know and that's uh 3.3 should be relatively straightforward, short paragraph that just says that we you know broke it down into lit search Yeah. data set development and then say a few words about each of those thing and then you know ideation and um uh composition. And then maybe we have a step at the end of you know review and criticism like of uh um you know um uh re drafting not redrafting what's revision that's what I'm after. Um.\n**Colleague:** You know so research task investigated should be fair should be um you know quite straightforward. Evaluation framework should probably focus on mundane utility. that that's what we are after. Basically we looked at the entire research process and that first day we started on ideation and we tested how well these agentic in quotes tasks um Yeah. helped.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah cuz so yeah I I ideation, lit review, data set uh creation, composition Yeah composition like all of what I've been doing right now is composition. Yeah this is composition. Yes. And and uh joint composition, you know. So composition and then I'm sure we'll have a revision step at the end.\n**Colleague:** Oh of course we'll put a revision. Like the logs for this are going to be stupid. Um but like oh my god the the the logs for this, the logs that I'm going to have to put up on OSF are going to be that's going to be a week of work.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. And that this is actually something that we should probably talk about is how uh how difficult it like how honorous I guess is the word that I'm looking for it is to document this process and get it like that that um Oh it's going to suck. LLMs are not really geared for showing you know for you sharing your work and making you know like\n**Colleague:** Oh yeah no. Like I have a set of bookmarks at the top of my browser for this exact reason.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Yeah. And so my primary evaluation criteria is did it provide mundane utility at that stage.\n**Philosopher:** Yep.\n**Colleague:** Um and ideation, no, not really. Lit review, yes, absolutely. Data collection, yes star. Um the composition process, this is spooky, yes.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. Uh-huh. Um\n**Colleague:** Yeah.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. Yeah, pretty So that sounds it sounds about right.\n**Colleague:** Yeah and and it's it's literally a gut check. It's like as professional researchers, as academics for for our careers, is this something that we're using because it's making our research more effective or is this something that we're using for the sake of it? And honestly the mundane utility question is the honest evaluation.\n**Philosopher:** Yep. And I I was kind of thinking of maybe it would be worth dividing this into the two things like is it improving like is it making research more uh like uh efficient and faster and to what extent you know and is it making the research does it help let me rephrase that. Does it help make the research faster? And I think the answer is yes. Otherwise you know we've been sitting on this paper for 10 years and we finally got it\n**Colleague:** Like for the data collection it made it possible.\n**Philosopher:** Right. So it so that's an efficient there's an efficiency side to it and a quality side to it.\n**Colleague:** And I would say that I would never have done a 5500 word lit review without this approach.\n**Philosopher:** Right. Yeah, no, I I mean I'm I'm finding that it it has that it if used correctly it can have positive or thoughtfully if used thoughtfully it can have positive quality implications.\n**Colleague:** Yes. So\n**Philosopher:** So that like just breaking down mundane utility.\n**Colleague:** That that's fair. And and honestly this approach in composition has taken me longer than just writing it.\n**Philosopher:** Right. Like\n**Colleague:** So\n**Philosopher:** So yeah so tradeoffs again as we've seen with other software tools that yes that\n**Colleague:** It's the\n**Philosopher:** something yeah. It\n**Colleague:** It's richer data not faster data.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** It's the claim that we made in our in the Fames papers.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. Yeah. All right. From the full set of activities uh that you tried Oh, this is a different question. I like it. Which three What is its obsession with counting? Uh most clearly stress tested models alleged research judgment and for each task what indicated did you treat as success or failure? Please answer in the triad format below. One, two, three, four. Yeah, no, that's stop. Counting Oh Okay, yeah, no. O3 I I I'm going to go back to using 4.5 because O3 is shit.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. No for this kind of work I I I think that 4.5 like just looking I've only used O3 a little bit um and I I think for this kind of writing work 4.5 is still is is clearly\n**Colleague:** Actually here's a test. I'm uh Okay, so I'm going to keep this question in a um thing. I just want to see if 4.5 just given alone does a better question. All right so as that's going What was it? What\n**Philosopher:** Oh sorry.\n**Colleague:** Uh most clearly stress tested the model's alleged research judgment and for each task what indicator? Uh data collection uh that we just demonstrated was the fundamental stress test. Did it figure out what sources to what the So 4.5 just starts writing.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** 4.5 says you're done, you don't need to answer the question. Just start.\n**Philosopher:** Uh maybe it's because you switched in the middle, I don't know.\n**Colleague:** Yeah no no like it it's it's it is interesting. Um\n**Philosopher:** So but um no I mean the I I in that part in this part about the stress test thing Yeah. I would say that there's two there's two steps to it. One was tool discovery like you know go through these journal articles and find the tools and or these journals and find the tools and the second you know and even harder one was um\n**Colleague:** And they're not good at that. none of them.\n**Philosopher:** And it Right. And that took a lot of scaffolding you know that it can't\n**Colleague:** But the point it it really failed at judgment at discovering research tools.\n**Philosopher:** Right. But we did we did get like 80 or 90 out of it in the end. So it it worked ask. Um you know but and then the next step was like you know find the instances of the tools. Uh and I'm not sure whether you think that worked better or worse.\n**Colleague:** Well I I think that that is a good example of its judgment. And then honestly I would say comp like the questions that the the reflective what would this be auto interview? Whatever. Um the questions that this composition technique are also a fantastic discussion on judgment because we can watch it watching us and the acuity and relevance of the questions are themselves very useful.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah. Yeah. It's uh having uh using the uh the LLM as an interlocutor to develop ideas and uh you know for and improve improve the rigor of your writing.\n**Colleague:** It really does yeah.\n**Philosopher:** And this is And this is a very different way than what how most people use it. Like most people want to make their writing faster and easier and don't want to get they like 04 because it tells them how great they are all the time. Uh you know that that uh uh four yeah or 40 sorry. Uh but this is Yeah. You know this is uh uh more like you know the where when you this is really trying to use the models to find you know to develop your ideas find weaknesses in your arguments make sure you're being thorough. Um and it's uh it's a very different way of using it than than what I what you usually see.\n**Colleague:** And like I'm I'm using the article that I did with uh Mark Alfano the proleptic arguments like I'm I'm using all of this to make the researcher uh richer and and that's the point.\n**Philosopher:** Yeah.\n**Colleague:** Okay."
