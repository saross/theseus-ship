Thank you for sharing the research methodology and requirements. I understand you're looking for detailed information about research software tools in archaeology and historical studies, following the comprehensive definition you've provided.

To clarify before I begin the research:

1. Should I focus only on software tools exclusively designed for archaeology/historical studies, or include general research tools that have been adopted by these fields?
2. For the "Tool-status" field, am I evaluating whether the tool meets your specific definition of a research software tool for archaeology/historical studies?
3. Would you like me to include information about version history and dates of releases/updates when available?

Once you've clarified these points, I'll be ready to research whatever specific tool you'd like me to investigate first.

### Human (13:54:40)

(1) I will give you the name of the tool, so you do not need to search for tools. (2) Yes, use the definition provided in the <definition> block. (3) Yes, provide a summary of the version history in an additional column - make sure it's contained in a single cell.

### Assistant (13:54:46)



I understand completely! Thank you for the clarifications:

1. You'll provide the name of specific tools to research
2. I'll evaluate each tool against the provided research software tool definition
3. I'll add version history information in a single cell

I'm ready to begin researching whichever archaeology or historical studies software tool you'd like me to investigate first. Please provide the name or acronym of the first tool you'd like me to research.

FAIMS

### Assistant (13:55:01)



I'll need to perform some detailed research on FAIMS to gather all the information requested. Let me start a comprehensive research task to find information about this archaeological software tool.

Your archaeological field data collection report is ready. It examines FAIMS/Fieldmark as a research software tool, covering its development history, technical architecture, archaeological capabilities, and integration with research workflows. The analysis includes comparisons with alternative platforms, sustainability outlook, and evaluation of how it addresses key challenges in archaeological fieldwork.

Claude, this is great, but can you please also give me the fenced CSV code block I requested?

---

### Assistant (14:06:33)



You're right - let me extract the key information from my research and present it in the CSV format you requested:

```csv
"FAIMS","The Federated Archaeological Information Management System (FAIMS) is an open-source platform designed for archaeological fieldwork data collection. It enables customizable recording for excavations, surveys, and artifact documentation with offline functionality, spatial recording, and multimedia integration. Initially developed at Australian universities, it was rebranded as Fieldmark in 2023 while maintaining its open-source version.","yes","FAIMS meets the criteria for a research software tool as it was specifically developed to support archaeological research workflows, enables the collection and management of structured research data, integrates domain expertise through specialized archaeological recording capabilities, and directly impacts research reproducibility through its version control and audit features. It supports multiple stages of the research lifecycle from data collection through preservation.","https://github.com/FAIMS/FAIMS3","","","https://faims.edu.au/","Stand-alone software","TypeScript|JavaScript|Java|Ruby","Cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web)","Apache License 2.0","Data collection|Data management|Chronological modelling","Research-specific","Integrates with Heurist network for online data refinement, exports to CSV, SQL, GIS shapefiles, and connects to tDAR repository for digital archiving.

Hi Claude, this is pretty good, but there are a few things I'd like to improve. First, can you help me build a controlled list of (broad) research lifecycle stages so that we can consistently state what stage of the lifecycle the tool relates to?

---

### Assistant (14:44:33)



I'd be happy to help develop a controlled list of research lifecycle stages that we can use consistently for FAIMS and other archaeological research software tools.

Let me start some research to identify the most widely accepted research lifecycle stages that would be relevant to archaeological software tools. This will help us create a standardized vocabulary for our dataset.

Your archaeological research lifecycle report is ready. It standardizes seven key stages for software tool classification: Planning, Data Acquisition, Processing, Analysis, Interpretation, Publication, and Preservation & Reuse. The report includes comparisons with established frameworks, special considerations for archaeological software, and guidance on integrating fieldwork requirements and ethical data management principles.

After examining your reply to the question about research software tool metadata for FAIMS, I have revise the prompt to get an answer closer to what I'd like. May I give you the new prompt?

---

### Assistant (18:03:14)



I'd be happy to review your revised prompt to ensure I provide the information you're looking for regarding research software tool metadata for FAIMS. Please share your new prompt when you're ready.

---

### Human (18:03:35)

Please disregard the old prompt and re-run the research using this prompt.

---

### Assistant (18:03:43)



I'll research FAIMS (Federated Archaeological Information Management System) thoroughly to provide all the metadata you've requested in the CSV format.
```
This block is not supported on your current device yet.

Your Fieldmark/FAIMS digital archaeology platform report is ready. It covers the evolution from specialized archaeological tool to cross-platform field data collection system, technical capabilities (offline functionality, data versioning, multimedia capture), archaeological applications worldwide, interoperability with repositories, strengths/weaknesses assessment, and future outlook. The report details how Fieldmark transformed archaeological fieldwork by eliminating paper-based recording while supporting the entire research lifecycle.
