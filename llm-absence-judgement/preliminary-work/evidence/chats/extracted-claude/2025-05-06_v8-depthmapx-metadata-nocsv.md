Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt.
A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 
Please always follow these **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" pattern for the name and title of your Report

I understand the task completely. You'd like me to research and compile metadata about research software tools used in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines following the detailed specifications in the provided prompt.

I'll apply the Australian spelling and punctuation preferences as well as the Writing Style Guide to ensure consistency in my reporting. For each tool you provide, I'll:

1. Conduct thorough research on the tool
2. Compile metadata according to the specified CSV format
3. Present findings in a properly formatted report with the title convention "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]"
4. Include a CSV code block with all required fields

I'm ready to begin researching the first tool. Please provide the name or acronym when you're ready.

I'll research Depthmap thoroughly to compile comprehensive metadata following your specifications. This software appears to be a spatial analysis tool used in archaeological contexts. Let me begin a detailed research process to gather all the necessary information.

This block is not supported on your current device yet.

Your depthmapX spatial analysis software report is ready. It includes an evaluation of its archaeological applications, technical architecture, development history, and viability assessment. The report provides details on depthmapX's capabilities for visibility analysis and movement patterns in ancient spaces, its strengths and limitations for archaeological research, alternative tools, and integration possibilities with other archaeological systems.

Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
