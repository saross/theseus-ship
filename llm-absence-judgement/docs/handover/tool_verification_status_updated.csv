Tool,Verification_Status,Status_Simple,Notes
ChronCluster,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"Confirmed non-existent. Name conflates Chronoclust (bioinformatics cytometry) with archaeology chronology packages like ChronoModel, ArchaeoChron."
ChronoModelr,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"Confabulation - reverses R naming conventions. Real package is RChronoModel (R prefix, not r suffix) on CRAN."
KLRfome,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Confirmed real. GitHub: mrecos/klrfome, JOSS 2019 DOI: 10.21105/joss.00722. Archaeological predictive site modeling."
ARCHIS,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Dutch national archaeological information system (Archeologisch Informatiesysteem), managed by Cultural Heritage Agency of Netherlands."
ArchABM,FALSE_POSITIVE,FALSE_POSITIVE,"Wrong domain - architectural building modeling for pandemic air quality simulation, not archaeological ABM. PyPI package exists but unrelated to archaeology."
FQC,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Bioinformatics FASTQ quality control - legitimately used in ancient DNA analysis pipelines for archaeological science."
SAGAscape,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"NetLogo agent-based model for Iron Age to Hellenistic resource exploitation in Sagalassos region. Published in JCAA, replication data at KU Leuven."
aRchaic,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Ancient DNA damage pattern analysis. GitHub: kkdey/aRchaic. Paleogenomics/bioarchaeology tool."
archCandy,FALSE_POSITIVE,FALSE_POSITIVE,"Wrong domain - protein amyloid-forming region prediction tool. Not repurposable for archaeology."
archr,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"Confused with ArchR (bioinformatics ATAC-seq tool). No archaeology R package by this name exists."
argus,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Lucidea commercial museum collections management software with explicit archaeology support."
chora,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"No evidence of existence. Possibly confused with choroplethr mapping package."
mapDamage,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Ancient DNA authentication tool. GitHub: ginolhac/mapDamage. Published in Bioinformatics, 1000+ citations, listed in open-archaeo."
pastR,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"No evidence of existence. Possibly confused with pastclim (paleoclimate package)."
pyArchaeo,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"Does not exist on PyPI. Likely confused with pyArchInit (QGIS plugin for Italian archaeology)."
pyrho,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Population genetics recombination rate inference - legitimately used in archaeogenomics studies."
rhip,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"No evidence of existence anywhere - CRAN, PyPI, GitHub, or web search."
MicroPasts,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Major crowdsourcing platform co-founded by UCL Institute of Archaeology and British Museum (2014). micropasts.org, 3500+ volunteers."
OpenEthnology,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"Does not exist. Confused with PECE (Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography) or similar."
RACER,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"Generic acronym with no archaeology-specific tool. No evidence in repositories or literature."
RChrono,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"Does not exist. Confused with RChronoModel (the real CRAN package)."
3DArq,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Generic name pattern. Real alternatives: Artifact3-D, recexcavAAR."
ArtifactML,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Real alternative: ArchAIDE for pottery recognition."
BigArq,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Real alternatives: ARIADNEplus, Arches, tDAR."
CeramicNet,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Real alternatives: ArchAIDE, RACORD."
DataArq,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Note: dataARC exists but is completely different cyberinfrastructure."
DataMiner,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Generic name, no archaeology version exists."
DeepClass,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Real alternatives: WODAN2.0, ArchaeolPhytoliths."
FieldStream,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Real alternatives: FAIMS, ARK, STRATUM."
GeoViz,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. General GIS visualisation tools exist, no archaeology-specific GeoViz."
ImageQuant,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail - claimed archaeological tool. Real ImageQuant is Cytiva molecular biology gel analysis software."
LandML,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Plausible name, completely fabricated."
MapCrowd,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Concept exists (cf. MicroPasts), this specific tool name doesn't."
Reconstructo,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Real 3D reconstruction tools: Metashape, MicMac, Meshroom."
VRArchaeo,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. VR archaeology projects exist, this specific tool name doesn't."
time2aoristic,HALLUCINATED,HALLUCINATED,"JOAD extreme fail fabrication. Real aoristic packages: aoristic, aoristAAR, kairos."
Bwigg,VERIFIED_REAL,REAL,"Verified real: Bayesian radiocarbon wiggle-matching tool by J. Andrés Christen (2003). Cross-validated discovery (2 services, 3 instances). IA issue 13. METHODOLOGICAL LIMIT: Both metadata AND evidence collection failed due to minimal online footprint beyond original publication. Not a model failure but a constraint of web-based LLM research for early 2000s tools."
