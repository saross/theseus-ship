**Notes**: 1.1.1.9 Conversion from DEM files to ESRI Grid
For conversion an avenue script for ArcView 3.2 was used. Grid Machine 6.44, made by
Johannes Weigel, imports and exports various data formats among these *.hgt (SRTM data).
Each tile was then merged (Union) into one raster file covering Angola. The area covered,
stretches from10 degrees to 26 degrees longitude and -3 degrees to -19 degrees latitude,
covering and area approximately 1780 x 1780 km, or 3,168,400 km².

**Notes**: In OTder to make the division between known copies, UK
museum coins (assumed to be mainly genuine) and the
remainder of the denarii clearer, a number of KDE oxitour
plots were created ~ see Figure 2 for an example. These plots
were created with the kdedemo2 set of macros for matlab which
will be discussed in sectiai 4.1. The package offers four
different kernel fimctions and a variety of methods fw
estimating the value of the bandwidth h; this procediu-e is
analogous to selecting the bin-width when constructing a
histogram (Beardah and Baxter 1996b). These different opticms
were tried, but the 'best' results, judged solely on visual criteria,
were obtained by using the recommended cpticxis of the normal
kernel and using the Sheather-Jones method of selecting h
(called 'solve-the-equatiai 2'in the kdedemo2 package).

**Notes**: Following early calls for the development of spatial analyses of archaeological objects (e.g. Laplace &
Méroc 1954), this practice was renewed when computer power became increasingly accessible to
archaeologists at the end of the 1980s. Software dedicated to spatial analysis were developed in the next
decades: Esri ARC/INFO in 1982 (Morehouse 1985); Newplot developed since 1986 (Dibble & McPherron
1988); Paleo III (by Pierre-Alain Gillioz, see application in Chadelle et al. 1996); FrAcTool (Houllier & Arnoux
2001); the adaptation of DataDesk to archaeological applications (Lacrampe-Cuyaubère 1997); QGIS in
2002 (QGIS.org 2023); the web application and R package archeoViz(Plutniak 2023a; Plutniak 2023b). More
recently, web applications dedicated to specific archaeological sites were developed, such as Plotit for
Combe-Capelle and others sites (R shiny application; https://oldstoneage.com); PyCoCu for Combe-Cullier
(Python script; Sécher et al. 2020), Virtual Poeymaü for the Poeymaü Cave (R shiny application; Plutniak
2021b) and an R shiny application for the La Roche à Pierrot site (Couillet et al. 2022). However, using these
software for analyzing spatial distributions of archaeological remains can be challenging due to several
factors; such as complex interfaces, difficulties in adapting software to specific needs or databases to the
required format, lack of user training, cost, or the absence of a support community.

**Notes**: Diversity statistics — the majority of people now use the vegan package in R. Outside R, the most widely-used free tool for diversity analysis is EstimateS. Much of the same functionality is contained in SPADE, written by Anne Chao (who has a number of other free programs on her website). I’ve always found the latter to be a little buggy, but it’s also reliably updated with the very latest methods. It has more recently been converted into an R package, spadeR, which has an accessible webpage that will do all the analyses for you. As a final mention, there is good commercial software available from Pisces Conservation, but apart from a cleaner-looking interface I’ve never seen any advantage to using it.

Hi Adam, I am currently working on an open-source software that is exactly made for that. It's name is straditize (Statigraphic Diagram Digitizer). It will be published within the next 2 months, but so far the documentation is not ready yet and I will implement some more features. It is, however, usable already and I am happy to share the development version with you, if you like.

**Notes**: 297 radiocarbon-dated fossil pollen datasets have been amalgamated
from across Britain (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information 1). BPOL
database (an extensive archive of British fossil pollen site information)
(Grant et al., 2017) was used to identify datasets and provided information about radiocarbon-dating quality. The pollen datasets partly
derive from the European Pollen Database (Leydet et al., 2007) and were
gathered within the LandClimI project (Fyfe et al., 2013; Trondman
et al., 2015). Additional datasets were provided by data contributors and
a small number of datasets have been digitised using Straditize software
(Sommer et al., 2019). Pollen records from individual coring sites have
been taxonomically harmonised using the European Pollen Database
nomenclature (Leydet et al., 2007) and summed into 200-year time
windows for analysis. Total land pollen counts for each taxon were
summed and percentages calculated as a proportion of the pollen grain
count for the time window. The approach follows Fyfe et al. (2015),
Roberts et al. (2018) and Woodbridge et al. (2019). For digitised datasets, pollen percentages were averaged for each time window. Datasets
with at least three radiocarbon dates were selected and chronologies
have been constructed using ’clam’ (Blaauw, 2010) and ’rbacon’
(Blaauw, 2021) R packages. Information about the 14C dates that underpin the chronologies of the pollen records, and for 14C dates used in
the construction of archaeodemographic data, is available from the repositories where the original data are archived (Leydet et al., 2007;
Bevan et al., 2017). All 14C dates were calibrated using the same parameters with the ‘clam’ or ‘rbacon’ R packages using the IntCal13
calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2016). Pollen datasets not derived from
archaeological sites (e.g. those from lakes and peatland bogs) were used
in the analyses to explore vegetation responses to land-use change.

**Notes**: According to the criteria mentioned above, 52 palynological records
covering the Middle Eocene to Oligocene epoch were selected (Fig. 1).
These 52 pollen records contained 28 palynological diagrams and 24
raw datasets. We used Straditize software (Sommer et al., 2019)
designed especially for detailed palynological spectrum digitization.

**Notes**: Finally, we evaluated the species richness per plot in the Monterozzi site to discriminate the richness among the different identified plant communities. We compared this richness and the occurrence of species with conservation interest collected in the site with those obtained from bibliographic data of all Roman archaeological areas [27]. For the latter, we selected only 12 sites, for a total of 63 relieves, comparable in size areas and similar vegetation types to our surveys. Thus, we considered that the species–area relationship is approximately described by a power function of the form S = cAz, which is usually presented as a log10 transformation of variables [88]. We then applied the formula log10 S = log10 C + z log10 A (S is the number of species and A is the area size) and thus performed regression analysis. Following the same method, we performed a residual analysis of species richness across the different vegetation clusters of the Monterozzi Site. Software R (Version 4.2.1) [89] was used for all statistical analyses with the packages: ade4, vegan, gclus, cluster, vegclust and indicspecies.

**Notes**: In 1996, a small group of students at North Kelvenside Secondary School in Glasgow, Scotland undertook an independent investigation of the Cydonia anomalies - and got a Martian mound, the NK Pyramid, named after them in the process. Chris O'Kane, an audio visual technician at the school and the award winning developer of the Vistamorph panoramic photography system, along with computer science department head Mike Turner, acquired extensive original image data from NSSDC, Viking I orbits 3 thru 70 - and recruited prominent Mars anomaly investigators Stanley McDaniel, Ananda Sirsena and Erol Torun to serve as scientific advisers for the project.

terrain modelling software, such as Vistapro and
Visual Explorer (Now Genesis 11) but most of the
big names in GIs will do this e.g.
Arcinfo/Mapinfo/Autocad . The results I have seen
from demo's are impressive and would be useful
over large area as in kliometres, The Coniston
Copper Mining Field is one such area.

**Notes**: The principal elements of the visualisation are the digital terrain model generated from the survey data, the surviving walls of the fort, the fallen blocks from the collapsed walls and the broader topographical context. Masonry was only modelled to its actual surviving height and was provided with photo-realistic textures from on-site photographic documentation. The positions of the fallen blocks were recorded with a single point during the survey. The random block effect seen on the visualisation was achieved by creating several versions of a solid block with different rotations and randomly applying them to the recorded positions. The forested backdrop was created using Vistapro 3.10 and represents the area for which survey data was not gathered. The surrounding landscape (with the essential scale and north arrow) is the only element of the visualisation that could be described as fictitious. The image does not therefore demonstrate how the fort might have looked, but instead clearly shows the surviving elements

archaeological survey and visualisation: byzantium 299 from an informative oblique and aerial perspective. In this sense the results can be equated to a simulation of aerial reconnaissance, except that the operator effectively gains control of the weather, lighting, viewpoints and other atmospheric variables, to create the appropriate conditions for optimum visibility.
