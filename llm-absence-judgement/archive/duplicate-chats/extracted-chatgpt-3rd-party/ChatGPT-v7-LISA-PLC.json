I will conduct a thorough and systematic search for mentions of the archaeology and historical studies-related software tool LISA, starting from 1995 onward.\n\n\nI will collect evidence for each year where I find a mention, including citations from scholarly literature, blogs, about pages, software repositories, and any other relevant sources. Each entry will include the tool name, year, source, URL, and AI notes regarding data quality and provenance.\n\n\nThe final output will be formatted as a well-structured CSV in a fenced code block, adhering strictly to the required columns: \"Tool\", \"Year\", \"Source\", \"URL\", \"AI Notes\". No inline citations automatically generated by the deep research process will be included.\n\n\nI will update you once I have compiled the results.\n\n\nResearch completed in 8m · 27 sources\n\n\nTool,Year,Source,URL,AI Notes\nLISA,1995,\"onlinelibrary.wiley.com – Local Indicators of Spatial Association—LISA (Luc Anselin, Geographical Analysis 27(2))\",\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x\",\"Original introduction of LISA (statistical concept); not specifically archaeology-focused.\"\nLISA,2001,\"ipi.uni-hannover.de – “PC-BASED DIGITAL PHOTOGRAMMETRY” (Jacobsen et al.)\",\"https://www.ipi.uni-hannover.de/fileadmin/ipi/publications/jac_PC_DigPhot.pdf\",\"Workshop paper describing the development of the LISA photogrammetric software; provenance is a conference (UN/COSPAR/ESA, Mar 2001).\"\nLISA,2003,\"Springer – *Digital Photogrammetry: A Practical Course* (Wilfried Linder)\",\"N/A (Book, ISBN 9783540008101)\",\"Springer textbook (includes LISA software on CD-ROM); exact URL not available – using published book details (first edition, 2003).\"\nLISA,2004,\"Photogrammetric Record 19(107) – Book Review by A. Behan (Sep 2004)\",\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0031-868X.2004.282_1.x\",\"Review of Linder’s 2003 book confirming LISA software features (version 3.0); secondary source (publication data verified, minor uncertainty in direct access).\"\nLISA,2005,\"Taylor & Francis/CRC – *GIS and Archaeological Site Location Modeling* (Schwarz & Mount chapter)\",\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780415315487\",\"Discusses integrating LISA (local spatial stats) in archaeology; chapter in edited volume (publication date Dec 2005).
