      "say": "Hi ChatGPT, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.\n\n\nArchaeological Research Software Tools Metadata Collection\n\n\nGround Rules\n\n\nACCURACY FIRST: Do not make claims without supporting evidence. If uncertain, clearly indicate uncertainty.

supports historical and archaeological research by facilitating data collection, processing, analysis, visualization, or dissemination in ways that contribute to scholarly inquiry beyond basic storage or display functions.\n\n\nEssential Criteria (Must Meet ALL)\n\n\nResearch-Specific Purpose: Primary function supports research activities rather than exclusively serving general computing tasks\n\nResearch Data Engagement: Collects, transforms, analyzes, visualizes, or facilitates sharing of research materials in discipline-relevant ways\n\nMethodological Alignment: Functions in ways compatible with recognized research methodologies from historical disciplines, even if this alignment is implicit rather than explicitly stated\n\n\nSupporting Criteria (Must Meet at Least TWO)\n\n\nDomain Knowledge Integration: Incorporates terminology, classifications, or procedures relevant to historical disciplines\n\nResearch Lifecycle Support: Addresses one or more research stages (planning, acquisition, processing, analysis, interpretation, publication, preservation)\n\nData Transformation: Converts between formats or representations relevant to historical research\n\nAnalytical Capabilities: Performs calculations, comparisons, or pattern recognition on historical data\n\nVisualization Functions: Renders historical or archaeological data in meaningful visual formats\n\nDocumentation Focus: Contains documentation addressing research applications\n\nData Collection: Specifically designed for gathering research data in field or laboratory settings\n\nData Dissemination: Actively supports sharing, publication, or reuse of research data beyond simple storage\n\n\nConsideration Factors (Not Exclusionary, But Informative)\n\n\nGeneric Functionality: Degree to which functions extend beyond general-purpose software\n\nPassive Repository: Extent of processing capabilities beyond storage\n\nDisplay-Only: Presence of analytical or transformative functions beyond display\n\nCommercial Origin: Despite commercial development, extent of significant research applications or adaptations\n\n\nConfidence Assessment\n\n\nBased on available evidence, classify the tool as:\n\n\nYes: Clearly meets all essential criteria and sufficient supporting criteria\n\nMaybe: Meets some criteria but with uncertainties, limitations, or borderline characteristics\n\nNo: Clearly fails to meet essential criteria\n\n\nEvaluation Process\n\n\nIdentify primary functions and intended use cases\n\nCheck against all Essential Criteria\n\nEvaluate against Supporting Criteria\n\nConsider the Consideration Factors\n\nDetermine appropriate classification, using \"Maybe\" when genuine uncertainty exists\n\n\nClassification Examples\n\n\n\"Yes\" example: A tool that specifically implements archaeological seriation algorithms, provides data visualization capabilities for archaeological contexts, and has documentation focused on research use cases\n\n\"Maybe\" example: A commercial GIS system with some archaeology-specific extensions but primarily designed for general geospatial work\n\n\"No\" example: A general-purpose database with no specific adaptations for historical research\n\n\nOutput Delivery\n\n\nPresent findings in a markdown fenced code block with quoted CSV\n\nInclude header row and single data row\n\nFormat multiple values within cells with pipe (|) separators\n\nEnsure CSV is properly escaped and formatted as a single continuous line\n\nDo not include any inline citations or references in the CSV itself\n\n\nFor CSV formatting:\n\n\nDouble quotes within fields must be escaped as two double quotes (\"\")\n\nEnsure no newlines appear within any field\n\nFor fields containing commas, ensure the entire field is properly quoted\n\n\nExample Output
