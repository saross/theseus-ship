	abstract = {AI "slop" is an increasingly popular term used to describe low-quality AI-generated text, but there is currently no agreed upon definition of this term nor a means to measure its occurrence. In this work, we develop a taxonomy of "slop" through interviews with experts in NLP, writing, and philosophy, and propose a set of interpretable dimensions for its assessment in text. Through span-level annotation, we find that binary "slop" judgments are (somewhat) subjective, but such determinations nonetheless correlate with latent dimensions such as coherence and relevance. Our framework can be used to evaluate AI-generated text in both detection and binary preference tasks, potentially offering new insights into the linguistic and stylistic factors that contribute to quality judgments.},

	abstract = {Change, being a fact of life, is inevitable even in software systems. On its own part, software has become both omnipresent and vital in our information-based society which is highly dependent on computers and software. Software need to be updated regularly to ensure preservation and maintenance of their values. There is therefore the need for software to evolve. In this paper, the concept and importance of evolution are explained while emphasis is laid on Lehman’s laws and perspectives of software evolution. Also, the relationships and differences between software maintenance and software evolution are brought to the fore. The laws highlighted that a software system must be frequently modified; otherwise it gradually becomes less adequate in use. It is pointed out that software lifecycle undergoes a number of distinct stages. There is a review of various software development models. Despite the challenges facing software evolution, the emerging trends are open source software evolution and unanticipated software evolution.},

	volume = {18},

	abstract = {This study examines factors contributing to the loss of four grant funded, free use digital humanities websites funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities' Education Development and Demonstartion Program, 1996-2003: Decision Point! at Auburn University, Hawthorne in Salem at North Shore Community College (Danvers, MA), the New Deal Network at the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute (Hyde Park, NY), and River Web at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The evidence shows that website loss did not occur suuddenly. In all four cases, organizations that accepted program funds to create online materials ultimately failed to develop or continue procedures to manage them effectively. As the organizations or organizational divisions that developed these websites struggled to sustain them or indicated an unwillingness to do so any longer, their creator(s) asked a college, university, or research library to take responsibility for them, without success. Online materials became subject to increased risk of loss in both contexts in part due to rapid technological change,often expressed in accelerating software product update cycles, combined with a general lack of funding and personnel available for addressing it after the end of grant period. Several other elements also played parts in website loss however, often shaping the ways in which technological developments and financial circumstances did their damage. In three instances website creators discovered that common vicissitudes of organizational life, including revised objectives, changing tactics used to achieve them, and new administrative personnel compromised website sustainability. In two cases adminstrators' responsibility for risk management led them to remove legacy websites made obsolete by new technology. In one case research pursung technological innovation in the retrieval and management of large data sets contributed to the loss of a funded resource. Finally, simple, inexplicable failure also contributed to that website's demise. These four cases can provide a digital humanities community increasingly concerned about the sustainability of grant funded online materials with additional evidence of how technological change and financial shortfalls threaten these resources. In doing so, it can also show how more complex organizational dynamics often contribute to website loss.},

One presenter did have unit testing on their todo list and the RSE teams involved in the sustainability panel did say they use testing as part of the software lifecycle but did not consider it part of preservation.

            Research software is a fundamental and vital part of research, yet significant challenges to discoverability, productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability exist. Improving the practice of scholarship is a common goal of the open science, open source, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) communities and research software is now being understood as a type of digital object to which FAIR should be applied. This emergence reflects a maturation of the research community to better understand the crucial role of FAIR research software in maximising research value. The FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group has adapted the FAIR Guiding Principles to create the FAIR Principles for Research Software (FAIR4RS Principles). The contents and context of the FAIR4RS Principles are summarised here to provide the basis for discussion of their adoption. Examples of implementation by organisations are provided to share information on how to maximise the value of research outputs, and to encourage others to amplify the importance and impact of this work.},

We present methods and tools that allow tracking of each line’s or token’s birth and death. Through them, we analyze 3.3 billion source code element lifetime events in 89 revision control repositories. Statistical analysis shows that code lines are durable, with a median lifespan of about 2.4 years, and that young lines are more likely to be modified or deleted, following a Weibull distribution with the associated hazard rate decreasing over time. This behavior appears to be independent from specific characteristics of lines or tokens, as we could not determine factors that influence significantly their longevity across projects. The programing language, and developer tenure and experience were not found to be significantly correlated with line or token longevity, while project size and project age showed only a slight correlation.},

Previous research suggest that future software maintainability can be predicted, based on various source code aspects, but most of the research focuses on the prediction based on the present state of the code and ignores its history. While taking the history into account in software maintainability prediction seems intuitive, the research empirically testing this has not been done, and is the main goal of this paper. This paper empirically evaluates the contribution of historical measurements of the Chidamber \& Kemerer (C\&K) software metrics to software maintainability prediction models. The main contribution of the paper is the building of the prediction models with classification and regression trees and random forest learners in iterations by adding historical measurement data extracted from previous releases gradually. The maintainability prediction models were built based on software metric measurements obtained from real-world open-source software projects. The analysis of the results show that an additional amount of historical metric measurements contributes to the maintainability prediction. Additionally, the study evaluates the contribution of individual C\&K software metrics on the performance of maintainability prediction models.},

	abstract = {Research software has become a central asset in academic research. It optimizes existing and enables new research methods, implements and embeds research knowledge, and constitutes an essential research product in itself. Research software must be sustainable in order to understand, replicate, reproduce, and build upon existing research or conduct new research effectively. In other words, software must be available, discoverable, usable, and adaptable to new needs, both now and in the future. Research software therefore requires an environment that supports sustainability.,  Hence, a change is needed in the way research software development and maintenance are currently motivated, incentivized, funded, structurally and infrastructurally supported, and legally treated. Failing to do so will threaten the quality and validity of research. In this paper, we identify challenges for research software sustainability in Germany and beyond, in terms of motivation, selection, research software engineering personnel, funding, infrastructure, and legal aspects. Besides researchers, we specifically address political and academic decision-makers to increase awareness of the importance and needs of sustainable research software practices. In particular, we recommend strategies and measures to create an environment for sustainable research software, with the ultimate goal to ensure that software-driven research is valid, reproducible and sustainable, and that software is recognized as a first class citizen in research. This paper is the outcome of two workshops run in Germany in 2019, at deRSE19 - the first International Conference of Research Software Engineers in Germany - and a dedicated DFG-supported follow-up workshop in Berlin.},

Now that the Digital Humanities (DH) are becoming a well-established research field, producing seminal publications in print as well as digital formats, the time for consolidation has come. It is noteworthy that digital tools and methods from the pioneering days of the DH are degrading and some have already vanished. Therefore, it is urgent to take action and to prevent further losses. While the necessity of high quality research data management (RDM) is encouraged or even required by funding agencies and there is an increasing awareness for long-term archiving (LTA), when it comes to primary research data, the fact that the DH exhibit a structural deficit regarding maintaining and preserving research software is at the least underestimated.

In this panel, we will focus on infrastructure and institutional support. Beginning with an overview of existing strategies from the DH and beyond, we highlight selected strategies to compare how they are implemented at different institutions in terms of infrastructure, expert knowledge and also funding. We also want to evaluate the extent of institutional support that is needed to successfully sustain and archive DH projects and the software they use. We will discuss currently implemented solutions to maintain and preserve research projects and software, all of which approach the outlined problem from a different angle.},

While researchers may be acquainted with such matrices, many do not know how to use them to enhance their careers. In addition to these metrics, a number of other factors should be taken into consideration to objectively evaluate a scientist's profile as a researcher and academician. Moreover, each metric has its own limitations that need to be considered when selecting an appropriate metric for evaluation. This paper provides a broad overview of the wide array of metrics currently in use in academia and research. Popular metrics are discussed and defined, including traditional metrics and article-level metrics, some of which are applied to researchers for a greater understanding of a particular concept, including varicocele that is the thematic area of this Special Issue of Asian Journal of Andrology. We recommend the combined use of quantitative and qualitative evaluation using judiciously selected metrics for a more objective assessment of scholarly output and research impact.},

	abstract = {Objective:
Our objective was to develop an evaluation framework for electronic health record (EHR)-integrated innovations to support evaluation activities at each of four information technology (IT) life cycle phases: planning, development, implementation, and operation.

Methods:
The evaluation framework was developed based on a review of existing evaluation frameworks from health informatics and other domains (human factors engineering, software engineering, and social sciences); expert consensus; and real-world testing in multiple EHR-integrated innovation studies.

Results:
The resulting Evaluation in Life Cycle of IT (ELICIT) framework covers four IT life cycle phases and three measure levels (society, user, and IT). The ELICIT framework recommends 12 evaluation steps: 1) business case assessment; 2) stakeholder requirements gathering; 3) technical requirements gathering; 4) technical acceptability assessment; 5) user acceptability assessment; 6) social acceptability assessment; 7) social implementation assessment; 8) initial user satisfaction assessment; 9) technical implementation assessment; 10) technical portability assessment; 11) long-term user satisfaction assessment; and 12) social outcomes assessment.

Discussion:
Effective evaluation requires a shared understanding and collaboration across disciplines throughout the entire IT life cycle. In contrast with previous evaluation frameworks, the ELICIT framework focuses on all phases of the IT life cycle across the society, user, and IT levels. Institutions seeking to establish evaluation programs for EHR-integrated innovations could use our framework to create such shared understanding and justify the need to invest in evaluation.

Conclusion:
As health care undergoes a digital transformation, it will be critical for EHR-integrated innovations to be systematically evaluated. The ELICIT framework can facilitate these evaluations.},

Today empirical methods are fully applied in software engineering. However, they have developed in several iterations since the 1960s. In this chapter we tell the history of empirical software engineering and present the evolution of empirical methods in software engineering in five iterations, i.e., (1) mid-1960s to mid-1970s, (2) mid-1970s to mid-1980s, (3) mid-1980s to end of the 1990s, (4) the 2000s, and (5) the 2010s. We present the five iterations of the development of empirical software engineering mainly from a methodological perspective and additionally take key papers, venues, and books, which are covered in chronological order in a separate section on recommended further readings, into account. We complement our presentation of the evolution of empirical software engineering by presenting the current situation and an outlook in Sect. 4 and the available books on empirical software engineering. Furthermore, based on the chapters covered in this book we discuss trends on contemporary empirical methods in software engineering related to the plurality of research methods, human factors, data collection and processing, aggregation and synthesis of evidence, and impact of software engineering research.},

            Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing several areas of Artificial Intelligence. One of the most remarkable applications is creative writing, e.g., poetry or storytelling: the generated outputs are often of astonishing quality. However, a natural question arises: can LLMs be really considered creative? In this article, we first analyze the development of LLMs under the lens of creativity theories, investigating the key open questions and challenges. In particular, we focus our discussion on the dimensions of value, novelty, and surprise as proposed by Margaret Boden in her work. Then, we consider different classic perspectives, namely product, process, press, and person. We discuss a set of “easy” and “hard” problems in machine creativity, presenting them in relation to LLMs. Finally, we examine the societal impact of these technologies with a particular focus on the creative industries, analyzing the opportunities offered, the challenges arising from them, and the potential associated risks, from both legal and ethical points of view.},

While locus of control (LOC), defined as the belief that outcomes are contingent on one's own behavior versus external forces, is traditionally viewed as a stable trait, its plasticity in response to AI experiences remains unexplored. Objectives: This study examined how explicit instruction and guided practice with multiple frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) impact students' knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and sense of control over AI-mediated outcomes. Methods: A longitudinal qualitative case study followed 12 undergraduate students through a semester-long experimental AI unit. Data collected through surveys, focus group discussions, and weekly observations were analysed thematically, using LOC theory as an interpretive framework. Results and Conclusions: Students demonstrated a clear progression toward internal AI-LOC, developing critical awareness and agency in their AI interactions. The findings revealed that sustained, scaffolded AI instruction enabled students to view themselves, rather than the technology, as the primary driver of outcomes. This transformation suggests that structured AI literacy education can empower learners to maintain agency in their AI use.},

This scale captures cognitive, affective, behavioral, and motivational components of the construct that have been identified by various philosophers in their conceptual analyses of intellectual humility. We find that intellectual humility has four core dimensions: Open-mindedness (versus Arrogance), Intellectual Modesty (versus Vanity), Corrigibility (versus Fragility), and Engagement (versus Boredom). These dimensions display adequate self-informant agreement, and adequate convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity. In particular, Open-mindedness adds predictive power beyond the Big Six for an objective behavioral measure of intellectual humility, and Intellectual Modesty is uniquely related to Narcissism. We find that a similar factor structure emerges in Germanophone participants, giving initial evidence for the model’s cross-cultural generalizability.},

This article looks more closely at the scholarship that has made this re-evaluation possible. The practical dimension of scholastic medicine — as evident in the resolution of conflicts between Galen and Aristotle as in discussions of specific drugs — has been fully revealed in this newer historiography. It discusses medicine as essentially a verbal and gestural performance that aims to leave patients ‘satisfied’ and the answer to these questions comes from the theoretical writings that are the main material deposit of all the rhetoric and from adopting the patient's perspective. The principal achievements thus far of the historiography of medieval medicine have been to assess many of the main texts on their own terms, avoiding reference to biomedicine, and giving the texts first an intellectual context and then, more recently, a social one.},

	abstract = {Recent generations of frontier language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces’ structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of compositional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs “think”. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) lowcomplexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models’ computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.},

As such, it may amplify the specificities of this project in its results.,An approach to project sustainability following the recommendations outlined in this paper would include a number of uncommon features, such as a longer development horizon, wider perspective on project results, and an audit of tacit and explicit knowledge.,These results can ultimately preserve public investment in projects.,This paper supplements more reductive models for project sustainability with a more holistic approach that others may learn from in mapping and sustaining user value for their projects for the medium to long terms.},

Given their capabilities, many intellectual laborers naturally question to what extent these AI models will be able to usurp their own jobs. As behavioral scientists, we performed an effort to examine the extent to which an AI can perform our roles. To achieve this, we utilized commercially available AIs (e.g., ChatGPT 4) to perform each step of the research process, culminating in an AI-written manuscript. We attempted to intervene as little as possible in the AI-led idea generation, empirical testing, analysis and reporting. This allowed us to assess the limits of AIs in a behavioral research context and propose guidelines for behavioral researchers wanting to utilize AI. We found that the AIs were adept at some parts of the process and wholly inadequate at others. Our overall recommendation is that behavioral researchers use AIs judiciously, and carefully monitor the outputs for quality and coherence. We additionally draw implications for editorial teams, doctoral student training, and the broader research ecosystem.},

Working on real product innovation challenges, professionals were randomly assigned to work either with or without AI, and either individually or with another professional in new product development teams. Our findings reveal that AI significantly enhances performance: individuals with AI matched the performance of teams without AI, demonstrating that AI can effectively replicate certain benefits of human collaboration. Moreover, AI breaks down functional silos. Without AI, R\&D professionals tended to suggest more technical solutions, while Commercial professionals leaned towards commerciallyoriented proposals. Professionals using AI produced balanced solutions, regardless of their professional background. Finally, AI’s language-based interface prompted more positive selfreported emotional responses among participants, suggesting it can fulfill part of the social and motivational role traditionally offered by human teammates. Our results suggest that AI adoption at scale in knowledge work reshapes not only performance but also how expertise and social connectivity manifest within teams, compelling organizations to rethink the very structure of collaborative work.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the potential educational uses of chat-based large language models (LLMs), moving past initial hype and skepticism. Although LLM outputs often evoke fascination and resemble human writing, they are unpredictable and must be used with discernment. Several metaphors—like calculators, cars, and drunk tutors—highlight distinct models for student interactions with LLMs, which we explore in the paper. We suggest that LLMs hold a potential in students’ learning by fostering proleptic reasoning through scaffolding, i.e., presenting a technological accompaniment in anticipating and responding to potential objections to arguments. Here, the technical limitations of LLMs can be reframed as beneficial when fostering anticipatory reasoning. Whether their outputs are accurate or not, evaluating them stimulates learning. LLMs require students to critically engage, emphasizing analytical thinking over mere memorization. This interaction helps solidify knowledge. Additionally, we explore how engaging with LLMs can prepare students for constructive collective discussions and provide first steps in addressing epistemic injustices by highlighting potential research blind spots. Thus, while acknowledging the sociopolitical and ethical complexities of using LLMs in education, we suggest that when used in an informed way, they can promote critical thinking through anticipatory reasoning.},

	abstract = {Background
The National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program provides a series of funding mechanisms to create an ecosystem of open-source software (OSS) that serves the needs of cancer research. As the ITCR ecosystem substantially grows, it faces the challenge of the long-term sustainability of the software being developed by ITCR grantees. To address this challenge, the ITCR sustainability and industry partnership working group (SIP-WG) was convened in 2019.

Objective
The charter of the SIP-WG is to investigate options to enhance the long-term sustainability of the OSS being developed by ITCR, in part by developing a collection of business model archetypes that can serve as sustainability plans for ITCR OSS development initiatives. The working group assembled models from the ITCR program, from other studies, and from the engagement of its extensive network of relationships with other organizations (eg, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Open Source Initiative, and Software Sustainability Institute) in support of this objective.

Methods
This paper reviews the existing sustainability models and describes 10 OSS use cases disseminated by the SIP-WG and others, including 3D Slicer, Bioconductor, Cytoscape, Globus, i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) and tranSMART, Insight Toolkit, Linux, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics tools, R, and REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), in 10 sustainability aspects: governance, documentation, code quality, support, ecosystem collaboration, security, legal, finance, marketing, and dependency hygiene.

Results
Information available to the public reveals that all 10 OSS have effective governance, comprehensive documentation, high code quality, reliable dependency hygiene, strong user and developer support, and active marketing. These OSS include a variety of licensing models (eg, general public license version 2, general public license version 3, Berkeley Software Distribution, and Apache 3) and financial models (eg, federal research funding, industry and membership support, and commercial support). However, detailed information on ecosystem collaboration and security is not publicly provided by most OSS.

Conclusions
We recommend 6 essential attributes for research software: alignment with unmet scientific needs, a dedicated development team, a vibrant user community, a feasible licensing model, a sustainable financial model, and effective product management. We also stress important actions to be considered in future ITCR activities that involve the discussion of the sustainability and licensing models for ITCR OSS, the establishment of a central library, the allocation of consulting resources to code quality control, ecosystem collaboration, security, and dependency hygiene.},

Alongside the difficulties of computing as an ubiquitous yet complex scientific activity, computational reproducibility suffers from a naive expectancy of total reproducibility and a moral imperative to embrace the principles of free software as a non-negotiable epistemic virtue. We argue that the epistemic issues at stake in actual practices of computational reproducibility are best unveiled by focusing on software as a pivotal concept, one that is surprisingly often overlooked in accounts of reproducibility issues. Software is not only about designing and coding but also about maintaining, supporting, distributing, licensing, and governance; it is not only about developers but also about users. We focus on openness debates among computational chemists involved in molecular modeling software packages as empirical grounding for our argument. We then identify and analyse four epistemic characteristics (transparency, consistency, sustainability and inclusivity) as key to the role of software in computational reproducibility. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.},

We want to contribute the first Systematic Literature Review(SLR) in this field to aid researchers who are motivated to contribute to that topic by providing a body of knowledge as starting point, because we know from own experience, this search can be tedious and time consuming. Aim: We aim to provide an overview of different aspects of sustainability in software engineering research with regard to research activity, investigated topics, identified limitations, proposed approaches, used methods, available studies, and considered domains. Method: The applied method is a SLR in five reliable and commonly-used databases according to the (quasi-standard) protocol by Kitchenham et al. [1]. We assessed the 100 first results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classified publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unfitting usage of terms within the search query. Conclusions: Currently, there is little research coverage on the different aspects of sustainability in software engineering while other disciplines are already more active. Future work includes extending the study by reviewing a higher number of publications, including dedicated journal and workshop searches, and snowballing.},

	abstract = {Challenges related to development, deployment, and maintenance of reusable software for science are becoming a growing concern. Many scientists' research increasingly depends on the quality and availability of software upon which their works are built. To highlight some of these issues and share experiences, the First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE1) was held in November 2013 in conjunction with the SC13 Conference. The workshop featured keynote presentations and a large number (54) of solicited extended abstracts that were grouped into three themes and presented via panels. A set of collaborative notes of the presentations and discussion was taken during the workshop. Unique perspectives were captured about issues such as comprehensive documentation, development and deployment practices, software licenses and career paths for developers. Attribution systems that account for evidence of software contribution and impact were also discussed. These include mechanisms such as Digital Object Identifiers, publication of "software papers", and the use of online systems, for example source code repositories like GitHub. This paper summarizes the issues and shared experiences that were discussed, including cross-cutting issues and use cases. It joins a nascent literature seeking to understand what drives software work in science, and how it is impacted by the reward systems of science. These incentives can determine the extent to which developers are motivated to build software for the long-term, for the use of others, and whether to work collaboratively or separately. It also explores community building, leadership, and dynamics in relation to successful scientific software.},

	abstract = {Context:
Modern societies are highly dependent on complex, large-scale, software-intensive systems that increasingly operate within an environment of continuous availability, which are challenging to maintain, and evolve in response to changes in stakeholder requirements of the system. Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability – the capacity to endure in changing environments – is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice.
Objective:
The objective of the paper is to re-examine our previous assumptions and arguments in light of advances in the field. This reflection paper provides an opportunity to obtain new insights into the trends in software sustainability in both academia and industry, from a software architecture perspective specifically and software engineering more broadly. Given advances in research in the field, the increasing introduction of academic courses on different sustainability topics, and the engagement of companies to cope with sustainability goals, we reflect on advances and maturity about the role sustainability in general plays in today’s society. More specifically, we revisit the trends, open issues and research challenges identified five years ago in our previous paper on software sustainability research and practice from a software architecture viewpoint, which aimed to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures in order to consider how this paper influenced and motivated research in the intervening years.
Method:
The forward snowballing method was used to establish the methodological basis for our reflection on the state of the art. A total of 234 studies were identified between April 2018 and June 2023 and 102 studies were found to be relevant according to the selection criteria. A further subset was mapped to the primary themes of the original paper including definitions and concepts, reference architectures, measures and metrics, and education.
Vision:
The vision of this reflection paper is to provide a new foundation and road map of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software engineering highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.},

	abstract = {Context
Modern societies are highly dependent on complex, large-scale, software-intensive systems that increasingly operate within an environment of continuous availability, which is challenging to maintain and evolve in response to the inevitable changes in stakeholder goals and requirements of the system. Software architectures are the foundation of any software system and provide a mechanism for reasoning about core software quality requirements. Their sustainability – the capacity to endure in changing environments – is a critical concern for software architecture research and practice.
Problem
Accidental software complexity accrues both naturally and gradually over time as part of the overall software design and development process. From a software architecture perspective, this allows several issues to overlap including, but not limited to: the accumulation of technical debt design decisions of individual components and systems leading to coupling and cohesion issues; the application of tacit architectural knowledge resulting in unsystematic and undocumented design decisions; architectural knowledge vaporisation of design choices and the continued ability of the organization to understand the architecture of its systems; sustainability debt and the broader cumulative effects of flawed architectural design choices over time resulting in code smells, architectural brittleness, erosion, and drift, which ultimately lead to decay and software death. Sustainable software architectures are required to evolve over the entire lifecycle of the system from initial design inception to end-of-life to achieve efficient and effective maintenance and evolutionary change.
Method
This article outlines general principles and perspectives on sustainability with regards to software systems to provide a context and terminology for framing the discourse on software architectures and sustainability. Focusing on the capacity of software architectures and architectural design choices to endure over time, it highlights some of the recent research trends and approaches with regards to explicitly addressing sustainability in the context of software architectures.
Contribution
The principal aim of this article is to provide a foundation and roadmap of emerging research themes in the area of sustainable software architectures highlighting recent trends, and open issues and research challenges.},

The paper provides an insight on the project life-span for a free open source software ecosystem. The statistical analysis of some project characteristics in GitHub is presented, and we find that the choices of programming languages, the number of files, the label format of the project, and the relevant membership expressions can impact the life-span of a project. Based on these discovered characteristics, we also propose a prediction model to estimate the project life-span in open source software ecosystems.

            Diving below the surface has its challenges, however. For example, “noise effects” are especially widespread when digital images have been created from earlier microphotographic copies, as is common in historical newspaper collections. Noise effects introduce interference to the primary signals of the pages, both for human vision and computer vision and processing. Various types of noise effects (fig. 1) are common, including unevenly distributed luminosity (i.e., range effects), visible characters from the other side of the page (bleed-through), tilted document scans (skewed orientation), and markings on the newspaper that obscure text (blobs).1 There is a wide range of severity for each of these effects, and images can range from very clean to very noisy within and across datasets.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This paper proposes a new perspective on the enormous and unresolved challenge to existing practices of publication and documentation posed by the outputs of digital research projects in the humanities, where much good work is being lost due to resource or technical challenges.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The paper documents and analyses both the existing literature on promoting sustainability for the outputs of digital humanities projects and the innovative approach of a single large-scale project.
            
            
              Findings
              The findings of the research presented show that sustainability planning for large-scale research projects needs to consider data and technology but also community, communications and process knowledge simultaneously. In addition, it should focus not only on a project as a collection of tangible and intangible assets, but also on the potential user base for these assets and what these users consider valuable about them.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The conclusions of the paper have been formulated in the context of one specific project. As such, it may amplify the specificities of this project in its results.
            
            
              Practical implications
              An approach to project sustainability following the recommendations outlined in this paper would include a number of uncommon features, such as a longer development horizon, wider perspective on project results, and an audit of tacit and explicit knowledge.
            
            
              Social Implications
              These results can ultimately preserve public investment in projects.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper supplements more reductive models for project sustainability with a more holistic approach that others may learn from in mapping and sustaining user value for their projects for the medium to long terms.},

It will discuss a variety of types of soft funding available from public, private, and institutional sources, and the ways the needs of funders can align with or compete with the desires of scholars. The availability and sustainability of funding as project needs change over time, along with funders' agendas, can influence project teams' decisions about the direction a project will take, who leads it, who can contribute to it, what technology supports it, on what servers it is hosted, if and when it can be updated, as well as if and where it will be preserved. Not considering the implications of financial support received can be detrimental to both the project and the researchers involved. Seeking funding should become part of wider strategies that enable the formation of mutually beneficial relationships, promising avenues of research, and sustainable revenue streams, rather than a time sink that explodes a project's scope in ways that undermine the project.},

            Concepts of sustainability touch every aspect of scholarly work and are particularly urgent in thinking about those practices that depend on digital technology. The costs of digital scholarship are frequently posed in terms of human labor and rights abuses, ecological and environmental damage, carbon footprints, waste of resources associated with obsolescence, and other issues that affect every stage of the lifecycle of production. But sustainability also needs to be understood as an epistemic concept embedded in complex systems, not merely as a set of problems to be solved through instrumental means applied to operational logistics. This article addresses mechanistic approaches to sustainability, while suggesting that the complexity of the concept of sustainability requires the humanistic methods and ethical principles to be engaged in decisions about future practices in pedagogy, research, and institutional sites.},

We fist identify threats, risks, catastrophes and ignorance as distinct kinds of danger. We then demonstrate how different notions of probability are used to determine their magnitude and to assign political responsibility. In the third part, we show how these 'logics of danger' play out in current anti-terror strategies.

Three field directors report their experiences adapting FAIMS software to projects in Turkey, Malawi, and Peru, highlighting three themes: (1) the transition from paper to digital recording has upfront costs with backend pay-off, (2) the transition involves decisions and tradeoffs that archaeologists and technologists need to make together, and (3) digital recording has both short- and long-term benefits. In the short-term, project directors reported efficient acquisition of richer, more accurate, data. Longer-term, they anticipated that the availability of comprehensive, born-digital datasets would support rigorous demonstration of field intuitions and faster publication of more complete datasets. We argue that cooperative development involving archaeologists and technologists can produce high-quality, fit-for-purpose software, representing the best chance to embedding new technology in established projects.},

	abstract = {This chapter summarises the experience acquired by the Federated Archaeological Information Management Systems (FAIMS) project over the course of developing open-source software for archaeologists. open-source software development, which excels at coordinating discrete contributions from many people and organisations, ooers the best hope for producing complex and expensive tools in a discipline where resources are limited. Over the course of this project, we have come to realise that open-source approaches have applications in archaeological research beyond the development of software itself. The development of redeployable eld recording systems, which must be exible and robust in order to accommodate the diversity of archaeological data, represent one such application. FAIMS project software facilitates this type of development by separating the (large and complicated) application code from the (relatively simple and largely human-readable) document les that customise the application for use by a particular project. Distributed version control systems like GitHub, which are already being used for texts and documents beyond code, provide a capable platform for coordinating peer production of these deenition documents. FAIMS has used GitHub successfully for its internal development of early-adopter eld projects over the last year, demonstrating its potential. Just as open-source approaches have improved software by bringing the insights of an entire community to bear on diicult problems, eld recording systems-as well as the methods and approaches they embody also beneet from the transparency provided by wide distribution and collaboration facilitated by version control systems.},

	abstract = {Archaeology has an issue with “just-in-time” research, where insufficient attention is paid to articulating a research design before fieldwork begins. Data collection, management, and analysis approaches are under-planned and, often, evolved during fieldwork. While reducing the amount of preparation time for busy researchers, these tendencies reduce the reliability of research by exacerbating the effects of cognitive biases and perverse professional incentives. They cost time later through the accrual of technical debt. Worse, these practices hinder research transparency and scalability by undermining the quality, consistency, and compatibility of data. Archaeologists would benefit from embracing the “preregistration revolution” sweeping other disciplines. By publicly commiting to research design and methodology ahead of time, researchers can produce more robust research, generate useful and reusable datasets, and reduce the time spent correcting problems with data. Preregistration can accommodate the diversity of archaeological research, including quantitative and qualitative approaches, hypothesis-testing and hypothesis-generating research paradigms, and place-specific and generalising aims. It is appropriate regardless of the technical approach to data collection and analysis. More broadly, it encourages a more considered, thoughtful approach to research design. Preregistration templates for the social sciences can be adopted for use by archaeologists.},

Project development is focusing on highly customisable mobile applications for data collection, a web application for data processing, and an online repository for archiving and disseminating data, with provisions for creating semantically and technically compatible datasets embedded throughout. Data exchange using standard formats and approaches ensures that components work well together, and that new, externally developed tools can be added later.

Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.},

Both scenarios may be resolved by ascribing proper amounts of cognitive authority to Internet information. Traditional measures of authority present in a print environment are lacking on the Internet, and, even when occasionally present, are of questionable veracity. A formal model and evaluative criteria are herein suggested and explained to provide a means for accurately ascribing cognitive authority in a networked environment; the model is unique in its representation of overt and covert affiliations as a mechanism for ascribing proper authority to Internet information.},

While we argue that the 'calculator for words' analogy serves as an effective negative heuristic -- discouraging users from treating generative AI prompts as search engine queries -- it falls short in providing positive intuition for effective LLM utilisation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel conceptual framework: 'maps of no territory.'

Drawing inspiration from Borges' 'On Exactitude in Science,' our 'maps of no territory' analogy aims to provide more nuanced intuitions for general audiences, guiding them towards effective use while steering them away from problematic applications. This metaphor offers a more comprehensive understanding of LLMs' nature, capabilities, and limitations, potentially fostering more informed and responsible engagement with these powerful AI systems.},

	abstract = {The genealogy of observation as a philosophical term goes back to the ancient Greek astronomical and medical traditions, and the revival of the concept in the Renaissance also happened in the astronomical and medical context. This essay focuses primarily on the medical genealogy of the concept of observation. In ancient Greek culture, an elaboration of the concept of observation (tērēsis) first emerged in the Hellenistic age with the medical sect of the Empirics, to be further developed by the ancient Sceptics. Basically unknown in the Middle Ages, the Empirics’ conceptualisation of tērēsis trickled back into Western medicine in the fourteenth century, but its meaning seems to have been fully recovered by European scholars only in the 1560s, concomitantly with the first Latin translation of the works of Sextus Empiricus. As a category originally associated with medical Scepticism, observatio was a new entry in early modern philosophy. Although the term gained wide currency in general scholarly usage in the seventeenth century, its assimilation into standard philosophical language was very slow. In fact, observatio does not even appear as an entry in the philosophical dictionaries until the eighteenth century—with one significant exception, the medical lexica, which featured the lemma, reporting its ancient Empiric definition, as early as 1564.},

Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.},

As their applications expand into multi-agent environments, there arises a need for a comprehensive evaluation framework that captures LLMs' reasoning, planning, collaboration, and other social abilities. This work introduces a novel competition-based benchmark framework specifically designed to assess LLMs within multi-agent settings, providing quantitative metrics to evaluate their judgment, reasoning, deception, self-awareness, cooperation, coordination, and rationality.We utilize two social deduction games alongside three game-theory scenarios to create diverse environments.Our frame is fortified with the probabilistic graphic modeling (PGM) method, enhancing the LLMs' capabilities in navigating complex social and cognitive dimensions. We evaluate seven LLMs, quantitatively highlighting a significant capability gap of over threefold between the strongest, GPT o1, and the weakest, Llama-2-70B. It also confirms that our PGM enhancement boosts the abilities of all selected models by an average of 37\%. Our data and code can be found here https://github.com/cathyxl/MAgIC.},

A great many existing theories, systems and research programmes address the problems associated with generating behaviour to achieve a goal; much fewer address the related problems of how and why goals should be generated in an intelligent artifact, and how a subset of all possible goals are selected as the focus of behaviour. It is research into these problems of motivation, which this article aims to stimulate. Building from the analysis of a scenario involving a futuristic household robot, we extend an existing account of motivation in intelligent systems to provide a framework for surveying relevant literature in AI and robotics. This framework guides us to look at the problems of encoding drives (how the needs of the system are represented), goal generation (how particular instances of goals are generated from the drives with reference to the current state), and goal selection (how the system determines which goal instances to act on). After surveying a variety of existing approaches in these terms, we build on the results of the survey to sketch a design for a new motive management framework which goes beyond the current state of the art.},

We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.},

	abstract = {Intellectual humility is increasingly recognized as a cognitive virtue that helps foster truth-seeking and compromise, and mitigating polarization. Yet the current body of evidence grapples with a striking contradiction: The prevailing theoretical account suggests that intellectual humility hinges on metacognitive ability—the capacity to introspect on one's own performance which manifests in assigning due confidence to the varying accuracy of one's performance. However, empirical research testing this metacognitive ability account of intellectual humility has yielded inconsistent results. Here, we introduce a cognitive science approach informed by Signal Detection Theory, allowing for a more nuanced separation of metacognitive ability from correlated but distinct concepts (i.e., confidence and task performance). We conduct a national survey study among a national US sample (N = 999) involving the interpretation of one of the most heavily contested domains—climate change—lending itself for an investigation into how intellectual humility relates to cognitive processes in domains where it is most needed. To gauge participants' ability to distinguish true from false interpretations of evidence (i.e., task performance), we presented them with four summaries of fictitious studies on renewable energy, followed by 2-alternative forced choice questions that assessed their accuracy and confidence in their responses. Results showed that firstly, more intellectually humble citizens performed better at discerning correct from incorrect interpretations of the presented evidence. Secondly, more intellectually humble citizens exhibited a heightened capacity to adjust their confidence levels to the varying accuracy of their evidence interpretations–indicating higher metacognitive ability—and this association was robust to accounting for their superior task performance, and other preregistered covariates. And thirdly, in contrast to intuitive notions, more intellectually humble citizens did not exhibit lower metacognitive bias, the inclination to report lower (vs. higher) confidence in general. By highlighting the role of metacognitive ability in intellectual humility, the current study delivers empirical evidence for the ancient notion that epistemic virtues may involve metacognitive ability.},

The latter stages of the paper—Sections 4 and 5—address some epistemological and historiographical worries and sketch some examples of deep contingencies to guide further debate. I conclude by affirming that the concept of epistemic humility can usefully inform critical reflection on the contingency of the sciences and the practice of history of science.

Rooted in extant theories of agency, this account enables fine-grained, nuanced comparative characterizations of artificial agency. I show that this account has multiple important virtues and is more informative than alternatives. More speculatively, it may help to illuminate two important emerging questions in AI ethics: 1. Can agency contribute to the moral status of non-human beings, and how? 2. When and why might AI systems exhibit power-seeking behaviour and does this pose an existential risk to humanity?},

This exploitation is also essential in facilitating the presentation of cultural works and exhibits to a broader audience. Consequently, in this work, we propose a custom-developed digital repository that functions as software-as-a-service (SaaS), primarily promoting the safe storage, display, and sharing of cultural materials; enhancing accessibility; and fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of cultural heritage. The proposed digital repository service is designed as a multitenant architecture, which enables organizations to expand their reach, enhance accessibility, foster collaboration, and ensure the preservation of their content. Moreover, our technology stack incorporates robust and reliable backend technologies, such as Django, to ensure data security and efficient management. Meanwhile, the frontend is powered by Angular, which guarantees a user-friendly and engaging interface for exploring and interacting with cultural materials. Specifically, this project aims to assist each cultural institution in organizing its digital cultural assets into collections and feeding other digital platforms, including educational, museum, pedagogical, and games, through appropriate interfaces. The creation of this digital repository offers a cutting-edge and effective open-access laboratory solution. It allows organizations to have a significant influence on their audiences by fostering cultural understanding and appreciation. Additionally, it facilitates the connection between different digital repositories and national/European aggregators, promoting collaboration and information sharing. By embracing this innovative solution, cultural institutions can benefit from shared resources and features, such as system updates, backup and recovery services, and data analytics tools, attributes that are currently provided by the platform.},

	abstract = {Today, with the advent of Large-scale generative Language Models (LLMs) it is now possible to simulate free responses to interview questions such as those traditionally analyzed using qualitative research methods. Qualitative methodology encompasses a broad family of techniques involving manual analysis of open-ended interviews or conversations conducted freely in natural language. Here we consider whether artificial “silicon participants” generated by LLMs may be productively studied using qualitative analysis methods in such a way as to generate insights that could generalize to real human populations. The key concept in our analysis is algorithmic fidelity, a validity concept capturing the degree to which LLM-generated outputs mirror human sub-populations’ beliefs and attitudes. By definition, high algorithmic fidelity suggests that latent beliefs elicited from LLMs may generalize to real humans, whereas low algorithmic fidelity renders such research invalid. Here we used an LLM to generate interviews with “silicon participants” matching specific demographic characteristics one-for-one with a set of human participants. Using framework-based qualitative analysis, we showed the key themes obtained from both human and silicon participants were strikingly similar. However, when we analyzed the structure and tone of the interviews we found even more striking differences. We also found evidence of a hyper-accuracy distortion. We conclude that the LLM we tested (GPT-3.5) does not have sufficient algorithmic fidelity to expect in silico research on it to generalize to real human populations. However, rapid advances in artificial intelligence raise the possibility that algorithmic fidelity may improve in the future. Thus we stress the need to establish epistemic norms now around how to assess the validity of LLM-based qualitative research, especially concerning the need to ensure the representation of heterogeneous lived experiences.},

	abstract = {In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), are redefining how organizations operate, make decisions, and engage with customers. AI-driven technologies have become indispensable, providing businesses with powerful tools to streamline operations, derive actionable insights from vast data, and foster more meaningful customer interactions. For business leaders, scholars, and practitioners alike, understanding the transformative potential of AI isn’t just advantageous—it’s essential to staying competitive in an increasingly data-driven world.This editorial delves into recent scholarly advancements in LLM applications within business contexts, analyzing studies that explore AI’s potential across various domains, from decision support to creative industries. By introducing a structured framework, this editorial highlights key insights and contributions from recent studies, assessing their value to academia and industry. The following comparative analysis sheds light on how these innovations shape our understanding of AI’s role in business while pointing to future research directions.Puyt and Madsen\&\#39;s (2024) study stands out as a foundational exploration of LLM accuracy, assessing ChatGPT-4\&\#39;s ability to recount the history of the SWOT analysis-a vital business strategy tool. Their findings reveal that, while ChatGPT-4 effectively conveys general concepts, it struggles with detailed historical information, often producing inaccuracies or \&quot;hallucinations.\&quot; This gap underscores the need for LLMs to be trained with verified academic data, particularly for strategic business applications that demand precision. This study not only contributes to the literature by proposing methods to evaluate AI accuracy in historical contexts but also highlights the importance of rigorous information vetting in industry settings where reliability is crucial.In contrast, Raikov et al. (2024) explore a hybrid intelligence model that combines LLM capabilities with explainable AI (XAI) principles to enhance human-machine collaboration. Their approach emphasizes cognitive semantics, improving transparency and decision-making efficiency. The hybrid model\&\#39;s real-time adaptability addresses the needs of complex, regulated industries such as finance and healthcare, where trust in AI decisions is paramount. Academically, this study provides a valuable addition to XAI literature by demonstrating how LLMs can bridge the gap between AI autonomy and human oversight, making it a model for future human-AI interactions in complex business environments.Another significant study by Mariotti and colleagues (2024) examines the integration of LLMs with enterprise knowledge graphs to enhance data-driven decision-making. By enabling organizations to leverage knowledge graphs for more accurate and scalable data retrieval, this research provides a robust framework for businesses seeking efficient knowledge management systems. The academic contribution here lies in advancing the dialogue between LLMs and knowledge graphs, emphasizing ethical data handling and quality standards essential for industry applications. For enterprises, the study offers practical solutions to achieve streamlined data management, balancing automation with privacy and security. 2024) take a different approach, investigating LLMs\&\#39; role in creative industries, specifically within fashion design. They introduce a hybrid intelligence model that supports creative processes, allowing AI to complement rather than replace human ingenuity. While LLMs in this field demonstrate potential in automating repetitive design tasks and enhancing customer personalization, the study reveals limitations in AI\&\#39;s ability to handle spatial and stylistic nuances. This study\&\#39;s academic contribution lies in promoting human-AI co-creation, inspiring further research into AI applications across diverse creative sectors, including media and marketing.Collectively, these studies not only illuminate LLMs\&\#39; transformative potential in business but also highlight critical ethical and operational considerations. Ensuring accuracy, transparency, and data privacy are vital to responsibly integrating AI into business workflows. Future research should focus on enhancing LLM accuracy, refining hybrid intelligence models, and exploring creative AI applications, all while maintaining ethical standards. As LLMs evolve, interdisciplinary collaborations will be essential to harness their full potential, making AI an ethical, effective, and innovative force in the business world.},

It goes beyond the traditional logical paradigms of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by considering poor-formalizable cognitive semantical interpretations of LLM. XAI is immersed in a hybrid space, where humans and machines have crucial distinctions during the digitisation of the interaction process. The author’s convergent methodology ensures the conditions for making XAI purposeful and sustainable. This methodology is based on the inverse problem-solving method, cognitive modeling, genetic algorithm, neural network, causal loop dynamics, and eigenform realization. It has been shown that decision-makers need to create unique structural conditions for information processes, using LLM to accelerate the convergence of collective problem solving. The implementations have been carried out during the collective strategic planning in situational centers. The study is helpful for the advancement of explainable LLM in many branches of economy, science and technology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this study we test ChatGPT-4’s ability to provide accurate information about the origins and evolution of SWOT analysis, perhaps the most widely used strategy tool in practice worldwide. ChatGPT-4 is tested for historical accuracy and hallucinations. The API is prompted using a Python script with a series of structured questions from an Excel file and the results are recorded in another Excel file and rated on a binary scale. Our findings present a nuanced view of ChatGPT-4’s capabilities. We observe that while ChatGPT-4 demonstrates a high level of proficiency in describing and outlining the general concept of SWOT analysis, there are notable discrepancies when it comes to detailing its origins and evolution. These inaccuracies range from minor factual errors to more serious hallucinations that deviate from evidence in scholarly publications. However, we also find that ChatGPT-4 comes up with spontaneous historically accurate facts. Our interpretation of the result is that ChatGPT is largely trained on easily available websites and to a very limited extent has been trained on scholarly publications on SWOT analysis, especially when these are behind a paywall. We conclude with four propositions for future research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
