# theseus-ship

Study of research software longevity in archaeology and historical studies, plus a methodological companion paper examining LLM limitations encountered during the research process.

## Repository Structure

### `llm-absence-judgement/`

Methodological paper: **"An Absence of Judgement: AI's Limitations in Deep Research Tasks"**

Autoethnographic investigation of frontier LLM research tools (Feb–May 2025). Introduces "technoscholasticism" as a framework for understanding AI limitations: systems that privilege textual authority over critical assessment, lacking epistemic humility, inductive capacity, and correspondence with reality.

- `AbsenceJudgement.tex` — Main paper (PLoS-style LaTeX)
- `handover-to-CC/` — Working notes, analysis documents, project state documentation
- `results-tools/` — Tool metadata, evidence data, QA analysis
- `prompts-library-tools/` — Prompt versions (V1→V8 evolution) for metadata and evidence collection
- `preliminary-work/` — Earlier materials and transcripts
- `text-revisions/` — Draft sections

### `OpenArchaeo-work/`

Data preparation for the main "Theseus' Ship" paper on software tool longevity:

- CSV datasets derived from OpenArchaeo catalogue
- Python scripts for data cleaning and quote fixing
- Tool references dataset with temporal evidence

### `llms-deck/`

Quarto/Beamer slide deck on archaeological complexity and tool citations.
